<p class="indent">The notion of a compact topological space is (like every concept studied in this book) an abstraction of certain important properties of the set of real numbers. The classic theorem of Heine-Borel-Lebesgue asserts that every open cover of a closed and bounded subset of the space of real numbers has a finite subcover. This theorem has extraordinarily profound consequences, and, like most good theorems, its conclusion has become a definition. A topological space is compact (bicompact) if and only if each open cover has a finite subcover.<a href="#rsa1" id="sa1">*</a> A subset <i>A</i> of a topological space is compact iff it is, with the relative topology, compact; equivalently <i>A</i> is compact iff every cover of <i>A</i> by sets which are open in <i>X</i> has a finite subcover.</p>
<p class="h1" id="sec1"><i>EQUIVALENCES</i></p>
<p class="indent">This section is devoted to characterizations of compactness in terms of closed sets, convergence, bases, and subbases.</p>
<p class="indent">A family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> of sets has the finite intersection property iff the intersection of the members of each finite subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is non-void. The De Morgan formulae (0.2) on complements furnish the connection between this notion and the concept of compactness.</p>

The space <i>X</i> is compact iff each family of open sets, such that no finite subfamily covers <i>X</i>, fails to be a cover, and this is true iff each family of closed sets which possesses the finite intersection property has a non-void intersection. ∎</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> Let {<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>n</i> ε <i>D</i>} be a net in the compact topological space <i>X</i> and for each <i>n</i> in <i>D</i> let <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> be the set of all points <i>S<sub>m</sub></i> for <i>m</i> ≧ <i>n</i>. Then the family of all sets <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> has the finite intersection property because <i>D</i> is directed by ≧, and consequently the family of all closures <i>A<sub>n</sub></i><sup>–</sup> also has the finite intersection property. Since <i>X</i> is compact there is a point <i>s</i> which belongs to each <i>A<sub>n</sub></i><sup>–</sup>, and according to <a href="Chapter2.html#th2.7">theorem 2.7</a> such a point <i>s</i> is a cluster point of the net {<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>n</i> ε <i>D</i>}. To prove the converse proposition let <i>X</i> be a topological space in which every net has a cluster point and let <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> be a family of closed subsets of <i>X</i> such that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> has the finite intersection property. Define <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> to be the family of all finite intersections of members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>; then <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> has the finite intersection property and since <img alt="" class="mid" height="12" src="images/in136.3.jpg" width="42"/> it is sufficient to show <img alt="" class="mid" height="17" src="images/in136.4.jpg" width="85"/> non-void. The intersection of two members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> and therefore <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is directed by ⊂. If we choose a member <i>S<sub>B</sub></i> from each <i>B</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/>, then <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/in136.5.jpg" width="72"/> is a net in <i>X</i> and consequently has a cluster point <i>s</i>.

Therefore <i>s</i> belongs to each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> and the intersection of the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is non-void. Finally, the second statement <a id="page_137"/>of the theorem follows from the fact (2.6) that a point is a cluster point of a net iff some subnet converges to it. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">Under certain circumstances compactness can be characterized in terms of the existence of accumulation points of subsets. The following sequence of lemmas and the subsequent theorem indicate the situation. The problems at the end of the chapter show that the limitations imposed are necessary. It is convenient to use a variant of the notion of accumulation point in stating the results. A point <i>x</i> is an <i>ω</i>-accumulation point of a set <i>A</i> iff each neighborhood of <i>x</i> contains infinitely many points of <i>A</i>. Each <i>ω</i>-accumulation point of a set is also an accumulation point, and if the space is <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> the converse holds.</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="le5.3">3 L<span class="small">EMMA</span> <i>Every sequence in a topological space has a cluster point if and only if every infinite set has an ω-accumulation point</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> Suppose that every sequence has a cluster point and that <i>A</i> is an infinite subset. Then there is a sequence of distinct points (a one-to-one sequence) in <i>A</i>, and each cluster point of such a sequence is clearly an <i>ω</i>-accumulation point of <i>A</i>. Conversely, if every infinite subset of a topological space has an accumulation point and {<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>n</i> ε <i>ω</i>} is a sequence in the space, then one of two situations must occur. Either the range of the sequence is infinite, in which case each <i>ω</i>-accumulation point of this infinite set is a cluster point of the sequence, or else the range of the sequence is finite. In the latter case, for some point <i>x</i> of the space, <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>x</i> for infinitely many non-negative integers <i>n</i>, and <i>x</i> is a cluster point of the sequence. ∎</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="le5.4">4 L<span class="small">EMMA</span> <i>If X is a Lindelöf space and every sequence in X has a cluster point</i>, <i>then X is compact</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> It must be shown that each open cover of <i>X</i> has a finite subcover. Because of the hypothesis it may be assumed that the open cover consists of sets <i>A</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, …, <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> …, for <i>n</i> in <i>ω</i>. Proceeding inductively, let <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>A</i><sub>0</sub> and for each <i>p</i> in <i>ω</i> let <i>B<sub>p</sub></i> be the first of the sequence of <i>A</i>’s which is not covered by <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> ∪ <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> ∪ … ∪ <i>B<sub>p</sub></i><sub>–1</sub>. If this choice is impossible at any stage, then the sets already selected are the required finite subcover. Otherwise it is possible to select a point <i>b<sub>p</sub></i> in <i>B<sub>p</sub></i> for each <i>p</i> in <i>ω</i> such that <a id="page_138"/><img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/in138.1.jpg" width="43"/> for <i>i</i> &lt; <i>p</i>. Let <i>x</i> be a cluster point of this sequence. Then <i>x</i> ε <i>B<sub>p</sub></i> for some <i>p</i>, and since <i>x</i> is a cluster point, <i>b<sub>q</sub></i> ε <i>B<sub>p</sub></i> for some <i>q</i> &gt; <i>p</i>. But this is a contradiction. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">The following theorem summarizes information on sequences and subsequences, accumulation points and compactness.</p>

<p class="alpha">(c)<span class="padding"/><i>For each sequence in X there is a subsequence converging to a point of X</i>.</p>
<p class="alpha">(d)<span class="padding"/><i>The space X is compact</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> Lemma 5.3 states that (a) is equivalent to (b) and since a sequence is a net, 5.2 shows that (d) always implies (b). If <i>X</i> satisfies the first axiom of countability then (b) and (c) are equivalent by 2.8. If <i>X</i> satisfies the second axiom of countability, then every open cover has a countable subcover, <a href="Chapter5.html#le5.4">lemma 5.4</a> applies, and hence all four statements are equivalent. If <i>X</i> is pseudo-metric, then <i>X</i> satisfies the first axiom of countability, the first three conditions are equivalent, each is implied by compactness, and the theorem will be proved if it is shown that a pseudo-metric space such that each infinite subset has an accumulation point is separable and hence satisfies the second axiom of countability. Suppose that <i>X</i> is such a pseudo-metric space. For <i>r</i> positive consider the family of all sets <i>A</i> such that the distance between any two distinct points of <i>A</i> is at least <i>r</i>. It is easily seen that this family has a maximal member <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> by 0.25. The set <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> must be finite, for the <i>r</i>/2 sphere about each point of <i>X</i> contains at most one member of <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> and therefore <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> has no accumulation point. Moreover, the <i>r</i>-sphere about each point <i>x</i> of <i>X</i> must intersect <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> because <i>A<sub>r</sub></i> is maximal and otherwise <i>x</i> could be adjoined to <i>A<sub>r</sub></i>. Finally the union <i>A</i> of sets <i>A<sub>r</sub></i>, for <i>r</i> <a id="page_139"/>the reciprocal of a positive integer, is surely countable and <i>A</i> is clearly dense in <i>X</i>. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a base for the topology of a compact space <i>X</i> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is a cover of <i>X</i> by members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/>, then there is a finite subcover of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>. Conversely, suppose that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a base for the topology and that every cover by members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> has a finite subcover. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/> is an arbitrary open cover of <i>X</i> define <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> to be the family of all members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> which are subsets of some member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/>. Because <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a base, the family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is a cover of <i>X</i>, and consequently there is a finite subcover <img alt="" class="mid" height="13" src="images/inap.jpg" width="13"/> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>. For each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="13" src="images/inap.jpg" width="13"/> we may select a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/> which contains it, and the result is a finite subcover of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/>. This shows that, if “a base for a topology is compact,” then the space is compact. This is a useful but not a very profound result. The corresponding theorem on sub-bases is both profound and useful.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> For brevity let us agree that a family of subsets of <i>X</i> is inadequate iff it fails to cover <i>X</i>, and is finitely inadequate iff no finite subfamily covers <i>X</i>. Then the definition of compactness of <i>X</i> can be stated: each finitely inadequate family of open sets is inadequate. Observe that the class of finitely inadequate families of open sets is of finite character and therefore each finitely inadequate family is contained in a maximal family by Tukey’s lemma 0.25(c). Such a maximal finitely inadequate family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> has a special property which is established as follows.<a href="#rsa2" id="sa2">*</a> If <img alt="" class="mid" height="14" src="images/in139.1.jpg" width="34"/> and <i>C</i> is open, then by maximality there is a finite subfamily <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, … <i>A<sub>m</sub></i> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> such that <i>C</i> ∪ <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> ∪ … <i>A<sub>m</sub></i> = <i>X</i>. Hence no open set containing <i>C</i> belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>. If <i>D</i> is another open set and <img alt="" class="mid" height="14" src="images/in139.2.jpg" width="36"/>, then there is <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, …, <i>B<sub>n</sub></i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> such that <i>D</i> ∪ <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> ∪…∪ <i>B<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>X</i> and (<i>C</i> ∩ <i>D</i>) ∪ <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> ∪ … ∪ <i>A<sub>m</sub></i> ∪ <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> ∪ … ∪ <i>B<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>X</i> by a simple set theoretic calculation. It follows that <img alt="" class="mid" height="14" src="images/in139.3.jpg" width="68"/>. Consequently, if no member of a finite family of open sets belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>, then no open set containing the intersection belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>; restated, if a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> contains a finite intersection <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> ∩ <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> … ∩ <i>C<sub>p</sub></i> of open sets, then some <i>C<sub>i</sub></i> ε <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_140"/>The proof of the theorem is now straightforward. Suppose that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ins.jpg" width="7"/> is a subbase such that each open cover by subbase elements has a finite subcover (that is, each finitely inadequate subfamily is inadequate) and suppose that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a finitely inadequate family of open subsets of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/>. Then there is a maximal family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> of this sort containing <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> and it is sufficient to show that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is inadequate. The family <img alt="" class="mid" height="12" src="images/in140.1.jpg" width="39"/> of all members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> which belong to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ins.jpg" width="7"/> is finitely inadequate and hence <img alt="" class="mid" height="12" src="images/in140.1.jpg" width="39"/> does not cover <i>X</i>. Consequently the theorem will be proved if it is shown that each point in <img alt="" class="mid" height="17" src="images/in140.2.jpg" width="85"/> belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/in140.3.jpg" width="114"/>. Because <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ins.jpg" width="7"/> is a sub-base each point <i>x</i> of a member <i>A</i> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> belongs to some finite intersection of members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ins.jpg" width="7"/> which is contained in <i>A</i>. The paragraph above shows that some one of this finite family belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>, hence <img alt="" class="mid" height="18" src="images/in140.4.jpg" width="228"/>, and the theorem is proved. ∎</p>
<p class="h1" id="sec2"><i>COMPACTNESS AND SEPARATION PROPERTIES</i></p>
<p class="indent">In this section the consequences of compactness in conjunction with the so-called separation axioms will be examined. In each case the theorem proved is the assumed separation axiom (Hausdorff, regular, completely regular) with the word “point” replaced by “compact set.” A simple but important corollary on continuous mappings of compact spaces into Hausdorff spaces is derived, and finally we prove a separation theorem of A. D. Wallace which includes most of the earlier theorems.</p>
<p class="indent">It is always true that a closed subset <i>A</i> of a compact space <i>X</i> is compact, for each net in <i>A</i> has a subnet which converges to a point which belongs to <i>A</i> because <i>A</i> is closed.

The class of all families which possess the finite intersection property is of finite character and consequently we may assume that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is maximal with respect to this property by Tukey’s lemma 0.25(c).

<p class="indent">Several important applications of Tychonoff’s theorem occur in the chapter on function spaces; for the moment we consider a very simple consequence. A subset of a pseudo-metric space is bounded iff it is of finite diameter. Thus a subset of the space of real numbers is bounded iff it has both an upper and lower bound. The following is the classical theorem of Heine-Borel-Lebesgue.</p>

Because of compactness <i>A</i> can be covered by a finite family of open spheres of radius one, and because each of these is bounded <i>A</i> is bounded. To prove the converse suppose that <i>A</i> is a closed and bounded subset of <i>E<sub>n</sub></i>. Let <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> be the image of <i>A</i> under the projection into the <i>i</i>-th coordinate space, and notice that each <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> is bounded because the projection decreases distances.

Since <i>A</i> is a closed subset of the product, and the product of compact spaces is compact, the proof reduces to showing that a closed interval [<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>] is compact relative to the usual topology. Let <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/> be an open cover of [<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>] and <a id="page_145"/>let <i>c</i> be the supremum of all members <i>x</i> of [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>] such that some finite subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inc.jpg" width="9"/> covers [<i>a</i>,<i>x</i>].

<p class="indent">The closed unit interval is compact and consequently each cube (the product of closed unit intervals) is compact. The following characterization of Tychonoff spaces (completely regular <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>-spaces) is then almost self-evident.</p>

<p class="h1" id="sec4"><a id="page_146"/><i>LOCALLY COMPACT SPACES</i></p>
<p class="indent">A topological space is locally compact iff each point has at least one compact neighborhood. A compact space is automatically locally compact, every discrete space is locally compact, and each closed subspace of a locally compact space is itself locally compact (the intersection of a closed set and a compact set is a closed subset of the latter, and hence compact). Many of the pleasant properties of compact spaces are shared by locally compact spaces. The following proposition is a convenient tool for the study of such spaces.</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="th5.17">17 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>If X is a locally compact topological space which is either Hausdorff or regular</i>, <i>then the family of closed compact neighborhoods of each point is a base for its neighborhood system</i>.</p>

If <i>X</i> is Hausdorff and <i>W</i> is the interior of <i>U</i> ∩ <i>C</i>, then, since <i>W</i><sup>–</sup> is a compact Hausdorff space, <i>W</i> contains a closed compact set <i>V</i> which is a neighborhood of <i>x</i> in <i>W</i><sup>–</sup> by 5.9; but <i>V</i> is also a neighborhood of <i>x</i> in <i>W</i> (that is, with respect to the relativized topology for <i>W</i>) and is therefore a neighborhood of <i>x</i> in <i>X</i>. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">In particular it follows that every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular; actually a stronger statement is true.</p>

Then <i>V</i> with the relative topology is a regular compact space which is therefore normal <a id="page_147"/> (5.10). Hence there is a continuous function <i>g</i> on <i>V</i> to the closed unit interval such that <i>g</i> is zero on <i>A</i> and one on <i>V</i> ~ <i>V</i><sup>0</sup> (<i>V</i><sup>0</sup> is the interior of <i>V</i>).

<p class="indent">It follows that each locally compact, regular, topological space is completely regular and each locally compact Hausdorff space is a Tychonoff space.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not true that the continuous image of a locally compact space is locally compact, for every discrete space is locally compact and each topological space is the continuous one-to-one image of a discrete space (using the same set, the discrete topology, and the identity function).

This simple fact and an earlier result give a precise description of those product spaces which are locally compact.</p>

<p class="h1" id="sec5"><i>QUOTIENT SPACES</i></p>
<p class="indent">In this section the investigation of quotient spaces which was begun in <a href="Chapter3.html">chapter 3</a> is continued. We are interested in the consequences of compactness and the single theorem of the section summarizes some of the pleasant properties which result from the additional assumption. It has already been observed that the continuous image of a compact space is compact, but without additional hypotheses the image space may still be quite unattractive. For example, if <i>X</i> is the closed unit interval with <a id="page_148"/>the usual topology and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> is the decomposition consisting of all subsets of the form {<i>x</i>: <i>x</i> – <i>a is rational</i>}, then the quotient space is compact and the projection onto the quotient space is open, but the quotient topology is indiscrete (only the space and the void set open). It turns out that, if the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> are compact and the decomposition is upper semi-continuous, then the quotient space inherits many of the properties of <i>X</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="th5.20">20 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>Let X be a topological space</i>, <i>let</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> <i>be an upper semi-continuous decomposition of X whose members are compact</i>, <i>and let</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> <i>have the quotient topology</i>. <i>Then</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> <i>is</i>, <i>respectively</i>, <i>Hausdorff</i>, <i>regular</i>, <i>locally compact</i>, <i>or satisfies the second axiom of countability</i>, <i>provided X has the corresponding property</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> For convenience let us agree that a subset of <i>X</i> is admissible iff it is the union of members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>. In view of the definition of upper semi-continuity each neighborhood in <i>X</i> of a member <i>A</i> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> contains an admissible neighborhood, and hence the image under projection of a neighborhood of <i>A</i> in <i>X</i> is a neighborhood of <i>A</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>. Moreover, projection carries closed sets into closed sets (3.12). Suppose that <i>X</i> is a Hausdorff space and that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are distinct members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>. Then by 5.9 there are disjoint neighborhoods (in <i>X</i>) of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, these contain disjoint admissible neighborhoods, and the projections of the latter are the required disjoint neighborhoods of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>. If <i>X</i> is regular, <i>A</i> ε <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>, and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is a neighborhood of <i>A</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>, then the union <i>U</i> of the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is a neighborhood of <i>A</i> in <i>X</i>. In view of 5.10 there is a closed neighborhood of <i>A</i> contained in <i>U</i>, and the image under projection of this neighborhood is the required neighborhood of <i>A</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>. If <i>X</i> is locally compact, then evidently there is a compact neighborhood of each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>, and the image under projection is a compact neighborhood in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, suppose there is a countable base <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> for the topology of <i>X</i>. The family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> of unions of finite subfamilies of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is countable. For each member <i>U</i> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> let <i>U</i>′ be the union of all members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> which are subsets of <i>U</i>, and let <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> be the family of all sets <i>U</i>′ for <i>U</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>. Then the images of the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> are open and it will be shown that the collection of images is a base for the quotient topology. This will follow if for each <i>A</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ind.jpg" width="11"/> and each <a id="page_149"/>neighborhood <i>V</i> of <i>A</i> there is <i>U</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> such that <i>A</i> ⊂ <i>U</i> ⊂ <i>V</i>. But <i>A</i> may be covered by a finite number of the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> such that the union <i>W</i> of these members, which is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>, is contained in <i>V</i>. If <i>U</i> = <i>W</i>′ then <i>U</i> ε <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and <i>A</i> ⊂ <i>U</i> ⊂ <i>V</i>, and the theorem follows. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">There is an interesting corollary to this theorem.

<p class="h1" id="sec6"><i>COMPACTIFICATION</i></p>
<p class="indent">In studying a non-compact topological space <i>X</i> it is often convenient to construct a space which contains <i>X</i> as a subspace and is itself compact. For example, it is frequently useful to adjoin two points, +∞ and – ∞, to the space of real numbers. The resulting space is sometimes called the <i>extended</i> real numbers; it is linearly ordered by agreeing that +∞ is the largest member and – ∞ is the smallest. With this ordering (an extension of the usual ordering) it turns out that every non-void subset of the extended real numbers has both an infimum and a supremum and the space is compact relative to its order topology (<a href="Chapter5.html#pro5.C">5.C</a>). The extended reals are a <i>compactification</i> of the space of real numbers, in a sense which will presently be made precise. Of course, this device is primarily a convenience. It does not add to our knowledge of the real numbers. However, it does permit the use of the standard compactness arguments and it simplifies many proofs materially.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest sort of compactification of a topological space is made by adjoining a single point. This procedure is familiar in analysis, for in function theory the complex sphere is constructed by adjoining a single point, ∞, to the Euclidean plane and specifying that the neighborhoods of ∞ are the complements of bounded subsets of the plane. This construction can be duplicated for an arbitrary topological space; the clue to the topology to be introduced in the enlarged space is the fact that the complement of an open neighborhood of ∞ in the complex sphere is compact. <a id="page_150"/>The one point compactification <a href="#rsa4" id="sa4">*</a> of a topological space <i>X</i> is the set <i>X</i>* = <i>X</i> ∪ {∞} with the topology whose members are the open subsets of <i>X</i> and all subsets <i>U</i> of <i>X</i>* such that <i>X</i>* ~ <i>U</i> is a closed compact subset of <i>X</i>. Of course, it must be verified that this specification gives a topology for <i>X</i>*. This verification is made in the proof of the following proposition.</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="th5.21">21 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> (A<span class="small">LEXANDROFF</span>) <i>The one point compactification X</i>* <i>of a topological space X is compact and X is a subspace</i>. <i>The space X</i>* <i>is Hausdorff if and only if X is locally compact and Hausdorff</i>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> A set <i>U</i> is open in <i>X</i>* iff (a) <i>U</i> ∩ <i>X</i> is open in <i>X</i> and (b) whenever ∞ ε <i>U</i>, then <i>X</i> ~ <i>U</i> is compact. Consequently finite intersections and arbitrary unions of sets open in <i>X</i>* intersect <i>X</i> in open sets. If ∞ is a member of the intersection of two open subsets of <i>X</i>*, then the complement of the intersection is the union of two closed compact subsets of <i>X</i> and is therefore closed and compact. If ∞ belongs to the union of the members of a family of open subsets of <i>X</i>*, then ∞ belongs to some member <i>U</i> of the family, and the complement of the union is a closed subset of the compact set <i>X</i> ~ <i>U</i> and is therefore closed and compact. Consequently <i>X</i>* is a topological space and <i>X</i> is a subspace. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is an open cover of <i>X</i>*, then ∞ is a member of some <i>U</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> and <i>X</i> ~ <i>U</i> is compact, and hence there is a finite subcover of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>. Therefore <i>X</i>* is compact. If <i>X</i>* is a Hausdorff space, then its open subspace <i>X</i> is a locally compact Hausdorff space. Finally it must be shown that <i>X</i>* is a Hausdorff space if <i>X</i> is a locally compact Hausdorff space. It is only necessary to show that, if <i>x</i> ε <i>X</i>, then there are disjoint neighborhoods of <i>x</i> and ∞. But since <i>X</i> is locally compact and Hausdorff there is a closed compact neighborhood <i>U</i> of <i>x</i> in <i>X</i> and <i>X</i>* ~ <i>U</i> is the required neighborhood of ∞. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">If <i>X</i> is a compact topological space, then ∞ is an isolated point of the one point compactification (that is, {∞} is both open and closed). Conversely, if ∞ is an isolated point of <i>X</i>*, then <i>X</i> is closed in <i>X</i>* and is therefore compact.</p>
<p class="indent">The one point compactification is of a very special sort, and <a id="page_151"/>we wish to consider other methods of embedding a topological space in a compact space. It is convenient to allow a topological embedding rather than insist that the original be actually a sub-space of the constructed compact space. With this in mind, a compactification of a topological space <i>X</i> is defined to be a pair (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>), where <i>Y</i> is a compact topological space and <i>f</i> is a homeomorphism of <i>X</i> onto a dense subspace of <i>Y</i>. (To be consistent, the one point compactification of <i>X</i> should be the pair (<i>i</i>,<i>X</i>*), where <i>i</i> is the identity function.) A compactification (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) is called Hausdorff iff <i>Y</i> is a Hausdorff space. A relation is defined on the collection of all compactifications of a space <i>X</i> by agreeing that (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) ≧ (<i>g</i>,<i>Z</i>) iff there is a continuous map <i>h</i> of <i>Y</i> onto <i>Z</i> such that <i>h</i> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>f</i> = <i>g</i>. Equivalently (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) ≧ (<i>g</i>,<i>Z</i>) iff the function <i>g</i> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>f</i><sup>–1</sup> on <i>f</i>[<i>X</i>] to <i>Z</i> has a continuous extension <i>h</i> which carries <i>Y</i> onto <i>Z</i>. If the function <i>h</i> can be taken to be a homeomorphism, then (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) and (<i>g</i>,<i>Z</i>) are said to be topologically equivalent. In this case both of the relations (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) ≧ (<i>g</i>,<i>Z</i>) and (<i>g</i>,<i>Z</i>) ≧ (<i>f</i>,<i>Y</i>) hold, for <i>h</i><sup>–1</sup> is a continuous map of <i>Z</i> onto <i>Y</i> such that <i>f</i> = <i>h</i><sup>–1</sup> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>g</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The smallest compactification of a compact Hausdorff space <i>X</i> is <i>X</i> itself (more precisely (<i>i</i>,<i>X</i>) where <i>i</i> is the identity map on <i>X</i>). <a id="page_152"/>One would expect that the one point compactification of a non-compact space would be the smallest relative to the ordering ≧. If we restrict our attention to Hausdorff compactifications this is actually the case (a corollary to 5.G), although it is easy to see that there is generally no compactification which is smaller than every other. On the other hand, if <i>X</i> is a space which has a Hausdorff compactification (by 5.15 such a space is a Tychonoff space), then there is a largest compactification which we now construct.</p>
<p class="indent">For each topological space <i>X</i> let <i>F</i>(<i>X</i>) be the family of all continuous functions on <i>X</i> to the closed unit interval <i>Q</i>.

There is a very large literature on the subject and it is only possible to <a id="page_154"/>cite a few sample contributions. For a recent contribution to one of the oldest compactification theories (Carathéodory’s prime end theory) see Ursell and <a href="Bibliography.html#bib148">Young [1]</a>. <a href="Bibliography.html#bib48">Freudenthal [1]</a> examines a compactification which is maximal in a class much more restricted than that majorized by <i>β</i>(<i>X</i>).

He distinguishes between “external” descriptions of a compactification (such as that of <i>β</i>(<i>X</i>), and the almost periodic compactification of a group as sketched in <a href="Chapter7.html#pro7.T">7.T</a>) and “internar” descriptions (for example the Alexandroff one point compactification and the Wallman (<a href="Chapter5.html#pro5.R">5.R</a>)).

<p class="h1" id="sec7"><i>LEBESGUE’S COVERING LEMMA</i></p>
<p class="indent">There is an extremely useful lemma of Lebesgue which states that, if <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is an open cover of a closed interval of real numbers, then there is a positive number <i>r</i> such that, if | <i>x</i> – <i>y</i> | &lt; <i>r</i>, then both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> belong to some member of the cover. In a certain sense each open cover covers the points of the interval “uniformly.” In this section we prove this lemma and a topological variant which will apply to arbitrary compact spaces. The latter result may be considered to be an introduction to the ideas of the next section on paracompactness.</p>
<p class="noindentt" id="th5.26">26 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>If</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> <i>is an open cover of a compact subset A of a pseudo-metric space</i> (<i>X</i>,<i>d</i>), <i>then there is a positive number r such that the open r-sphere about each point of A is contained in some member of</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>.</p>

Then each <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> is continuous and consequently <i>f</i> is continuous.

<p class="indent">There is a useful corollary of the foregoing theorem. If <i>A</i> is a compact subset of a pseudo-metric space and <i>U</i> is a neighborhood of <i>A</i>, then there is a positive number <i>r</i> such that <i>U</i> contains the open <i>r</i>-sphere about every point of <i>A</i>; that is, the distance from <i>A</i> to <i>X</i> ~ <i>U</i> is positive.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="Chapter5.html#th5.26">Theorem 5.26</a> may be rephrased in a suggestive way. If <i>V</i> is the set of all pairs of points of <i>X</i> such that <i>d</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) &lt; <i>r</i>, then <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] = {<i>y</i>: (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) ε <i>V</i>} is simply the open <i>r</i>-sphere about <i>x</i>. The set <i>V</i> is an open subset of <i>X</i> × <i>X</i> and contains the diagonal Δ (the set of all pairs (<i>x</i>,<i>x</i>) for <i>x</i> in <i>X</i>). The foregoing theorem then implies the following topological result: If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is an open cover of a compact pseudo-metric space, then there is a neighborhood <i>V</i> of the diagonal in <i>X</i> × <i>X</i> such that for each point <i>x</i> the set <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] is contained in some member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>.

<p class="indent">A cover <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> of a topological space is called an even cover iff there is a neighborhood <i>V</i> of the diagonal in <i>X</i> × <i>X</i> such that for each <i>x</i> the set <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] is contained in some member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>.

<p class="indent">Finally, if <i>X</i> is compact and regular, then each open cover <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> has a closed finite refinement (cover <i>X</i> by open subsets whose closures refine <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>) and hence each open cover is even. ∎</p>

By the preceding lemma there is a neighborhood <i>V</i> of the diagonal such that <i>V</i> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>V</i> ⊂ <i>U</i>, and it may be supposed that <i>V</i> = <i>V</i><sup>–1</sup>. If <i>V</i> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] ∩ <i>A</i> is void, then <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] must be disjoint from <i>V</i>[<i>A</i>] because: if <i>y</i> ε <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] ∩ <i>V</i>[<i>A</i>), then (<i>y</i>,<i>x</i>) ε <i>V</i><sup>–1</sup> = <i>V</i>, (<i>z</i>,<i>y</i>) ε <i>V</i> for some <i>z</i> in <i>A</i>, and hence (<i>z</i>,<i>x</i>) ε <i>V</i> <span class="font">∘</span> <i>V</i>.

If “finitely many” is replaced by “at most one,” then a proof of the corresponding proposition for discrete families is obtained. ∎</p>
<p class="indent">If <i>V</i> is an open subset of <i>X</i> × <i>X</i>, then <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] is open for every point <i>x</i> of <i>X</i>, because <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] is the inverse image of <i>V</i> under the continuous map which carries each point <i>y</i> of <i>X</i> into (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>). If <a id="page_159"/><i>A</i> is a subset of <i>X</i>, then <i>V</i>[<i>A</i>] is open because it is the union of the sets <i>V</i>[<i>x</i>] for <i>x</i> in <i>A</i>. Consequently the preceding lemma permits us to enlarge each member of a locally finite or discrete family to an open set and still preserve the character of the family. In particular, if each open cover <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> of a regular space has a locally finite refinement <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>, then the lemma applies (we have shown that (b) → (c) → (d) in 5.28) and there is an open neighborhood <i>V</i> of the diagonal such that the family of all sets <i>V</i>[<i>A</i>] for <i>A</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is locally finite. The latter family may fail to be a refinement of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>, but this is easily remedied by choosing <i>U<sub>A</sub></i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> such that <i>A</i> ⊂ <i>U<sub>A</sub></i> and then letting <i>W<sub>A</sub></i> = <i>U<sub>A</sub></i> ∩ <i>V</i>[<i>A</i>]. The family which is constructed in this fashion is clearly an open locally finite refinement of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> and it follows that the space is paracompact; that is, (b) → (a) in 5.28.</p>

For each fixed <i>n</i> the family <img alt="" class="mid" height="11" src="images/inun.jpg" width="17"/> of all sets <i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>x</i>) is discrete, as may be demonstrated as follows. Clearly <i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>x</i>) is disjoint from <i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sub>+1</sub>[<i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>y</i>)] if <i>x</i> ≠ <i>y</i> because of the construction. If for some <i>z</i> in <i>X</i> the neighborhood <i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sub>+1</sub>[<i>z</i>] intersects <i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>y</i>), then <i>z</i> ε <i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sub>+1</sub>[<i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>y</i>)] and <i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sub>+1</sub>[<i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>y</i>)] is a neighborhood of <i>z</i> which intersects no set <i>U<sub>n</sub>*</i>(<i>x</i>) for <i>x</i> ≠ <i>y</i>.

<p class="indent">The <i>Cantor discontinuum</i> (<i>middle third</i> set) is the set of all members of the closed unit interval which have a triadic expansion in which the digit one does not occur. (It will be convenient throughout this problem to use only irrational triadic expansions, that is, expansions which are not identically zero from some point on. Each real number has a unique irrational expansion, as noted in 0.14.) The discontinuum is called the middle third set because: The (open) middle third of the interval [0,1] is precisely the set of numbers whose triadic expansions have ones in the first place after the “decimal” point. The middle third of each of the remaining intervals consists of points whose expansions have ones in the second but not the first place.

A simple argument on disjointness completes the proof.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a shorter, more sophisticated proof.

<p class="indent">Let <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> be, respectively, lower and upper semi-continuous real-valued functions on a paracompact space <i>X</i>, and suppose that <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) &lt; <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) for all <i>x</i> in <i>X</i>. Then there is a continuous real-valued function <i>p</i> on <i>X</i> such that <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) &lt; <i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) &lt; <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) for each <i>x</i>. (Let <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> be the family of all open subsets <i>U</i> of <i>X</i> such that the supremum of <i>h</i> on <i>U</i> is less than the infimum of <i>g</i> on <i>U</i>, and let <i>F</i> be a partition of unity which is subordinate to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>. For each <i>f</i> in <i>F</i> choose <i>k<sub>f</sub></i> such that, if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) ≠ 0, then <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) &lt; <i>k<sub>f</sub></i> &lt; <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>), and let <img alt="" class="mid" height="18" src="images/in172.1.jpg" width="152"/>. The value of <i>p</i> at a point <i>x</i> is then an average of numbers, all of which lie between <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) and <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>).)</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Notes</i> The result above can be improved by first finding a countable refinement for the family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>. The proposition then holds for countably paracompact spaces (that is, spaces such that each countable open cover has a locally finite refinement). The converse of the sharpened form of the theorem is true. <a href="Bibliography.html#bib43">Dowker [2]</a> has proved the equivalence of: (1) <i>X</i> is countably paracompact and normal, (2) the product of <i>X</i> and the closed unit interval is normal, and (3) the proposition above. Dowker also shows that a perfectly normal space (normal and each closed subset is a <i>G<sub>δ</sub></i>) is countably paracompact. It is not known whether a normal Hausdorff space must be countably paracompact.</p>
<p class="pro1" id="pro5.Y"><b>Y</b><span class="padding"/><span class="small">PARACOMPACT SPACES</span></p>
<p class="indent">(a) Each regular Lindelöf space is paracompact.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) A topological space is defined to be <i>σ</i>-<i>compact</i> iff it is the union of a countable family of compact subsets. Each <i>σ</i>-compact space is a Lindelöf space.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) If a regular space is the union of the members of an open discrete family of Lindelöf subspaces, then it is paracompact. Consequently each locally compact group is paracompact. (Consider the family of cosets modulo the smallest subgroup containing a fixed compact neighborhood of the identity.)</p>
<p class="indent">(d) The half-open interval space of problems <a href="Chapter1.html#pro1.K">1.K</a> and 4.1 is regular and Lindelöf and hence paracompact. The cartesian product of this space with itself is not normal and is therefore not paracompact.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) With the order topology the set of all ordinals which are less than the first uncountable ordinal is not paracompact. (Consider the <a id="page_173"/>cover consisting of all sets of the form {<i>x</i>: <i>x</i> &lt; <i>a</i>}. The supremum of each member of an arbitrary refinement of this cover is less than Ω.)</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Notes</i> Proposition (a) above is due to <a href="Bibliography.html#bib101">Morita [1]</a>. For further information on paracompactness (an <i>F<sub>σ</sub></i>-theorem, products, etc.) see <a href="Bibliography.html#bib93">Michael [1]</a>. <a href="Bibliography.html#bib18">Bing [1]</a> has studied a normality condition which is intermediate to normality and paracompactness.

<p class="fn"><a href="#sa1" id="rsa1">*</a> The term “compact” has also been used to denote “sequentially compact” and “countably compact” (in the terminology of the problems at the end of this chapter). N. Bourbaki and his colleagues reserve the term “compact” for compact Hausdorff spaces.</p>
<p class="fn"><a href="#sa2" id="rsa2">*</a> Problem 2.1 is precisely the result needed here.</p>
<p class="fn"><a href="#sa3" id="rsa3">*</a> We are evidently reproving part of proposition 2.1.</p>
<p class="fn"><a href="#sa4" id="rsa4">*</a> This definition is actually incomplete until ∞ is defined. Any element which is not a member of <i>X</i>, for example <i>X</i>, will do.</p>
