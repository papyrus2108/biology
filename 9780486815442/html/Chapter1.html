        <p class="indent">A topology is a family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> of sets which satisfies the two conditions: the intersection of any two members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>, and the union of the members of each subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>. The set <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/in37.1.jpg" width="118"/> is necessarily a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> because <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a subfamily of itself, and every member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a subset of <i>X</i>. The set <i>X</i> is called the space of the topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a topology for <i>X</i>. The pair <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is a topological space. When no confusion seems possible we may forget to mention the topology and write “<i>X</i> is a topological space.” We shall be explicit in cases where precision is necessary (for example if we are considering two different topologies for the same set <i>X</i>).</p>
        <p class="indent">The members of the topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> are called open relative to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>, or <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>-open, or if only one topology is under consideration, simply open sets. The space <i>X</i> of the topology is always open, and the void set is always open because it is the union of the members of the void family. These may be the only open sets, for the family whose only members are <i>X</i> and the void set is a topology for <i>X</i>. This is not a very interesting topology, but it occurs frequently enough to deserve a name; it is called the indiscrete (or trivial) topology for <i>X</i>, and <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is then an indiscrete topological space. At the other extreme is the family of all subsets of <i>X</i>, which is the discrete topology for <i>X</i> (then <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is a discrete topological space). If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the discrete topology, then every subset of the space is open.</p>
        <p class="indent">The discrete and the indiscrete topology for a set <i>X</i> are respectively <a id="page_38"/>the largest and the smallest topology for <i>X</i>. That is, every topology for <i>X</i> is contained in the discrete topology and contains the indiscrete topology. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> are topologies for <i>X</i>, then, following the convention for arbitrary families of sets, <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is smaller than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is larger than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> iff <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/in38.1.jpg" width="38"/>. In other words, <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is smaller than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> iff each <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>-open set is <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>-open. In this case it is also said that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is coarser than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is finer than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>. (Unfortunately, this situation is described in the literature by both of the statements: <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is stronger than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is weaker than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>.) If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> are arbitrary topologies for <i>X</i> it may happen that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is neither larger nor smaller than <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/>; in this case, following the usage for partial orderings, it is said that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> are not comparable.</p>
        <p class="indent">The set of real numbers, with an appropriate topology, is a very interesting topological space. This is scarcely surprising since the notion of a topological space is an abstraction of some interesting properties of the real numbers. The usual topology for the real numbers is the family of all those sets which contain an open interval about each of their points. That is, a subset <i>A</i> of the set of real numbers is open iff for each member <i>x</i> of <i>A</i> there are numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> such that <i>a</i> &lt; <i>x</i> &lt; <i>b</i> and the open interval {<i>y</i>: <i>a</i> &lt; <i>y</i> &lt; <i>b</i>} is a subset of <i>A</i>. Of course, we must verify that this family of sets is indeed a topology, but this offers no difficulty. It is worth noticing that, conveniently, an open interval is an open set.</p>
        <p class="indent">A set <i>U</i> in a topological space <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is a neighborhood (<img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>-neighborhood) of a point <i>x</i> iff <i>U</i> contains an open set to which <i>x</i> belongs. A neighborhood of a point need not be an open set, but every open set is a neighborhood of each of its points. Each neighborhood of a point contains an open neighborhood of the point. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the indiscrete topology the only neighborhood of a point <i>x</i> is the space <i>X</i> itself. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the discrete topology, then every set to which a point belongs is a neighborhood of it. If <i>X</i> is the set of real numbers and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the usual topology, then a neighborhood of a point is a set containing an open interval to which the point belongs.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.1">1 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>A set is open if and only if it contains a neighborhood of each of its points</i>.</p>
        <p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> <a id="page_39"/>The union <i>U</i> of all open subsets of a set <i>A</i> is surely an open subset of <i>A</i>. If <i>A</i> contains a neighborhood of each of its points, then each member <i>x</i> of <i>A</i> belongs to some open subset of <i>A</i> and hence <i>x</i> ε <i>U</i>. In this case <i>A</i> = <i>U</i> and therefore <i>A</i> is open. On the other hand, if <i>A</i> is open it contains a neighborhood (namely, <i>A</i>) of each of its points. ∎</p>
        <p class="indent">The foregoing theorem evidently implies that a set is open iff it is a neighborhood of each of its points.</p>

Thus the intersection of two (and hence of any finite number of) members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inu.jpg" width="12"/> is a member. If a set <i>U</i> contains a neighborhood of a point <i>x</i> it contains an open neighborhood of <i>x</i> and is consequently itself a neighborhood. ∎</p>
        <p class="noindentt">3 <i>Notes</i> <a href="Bibliography.html#bib51">Fréchet [1]</a> first considered abstract spaces. The concept of a topological space developed during the following years, accompanied by a good deal of experimentation with definitions and fundamental processes. Much of the development of the theory may be found in Hausdorff’s classic work [1] and, a little later, in the early volumes of <i>Fundamenta Mathematicae</i> There are actually two fundamental concepts which have grown out of these researches: that of a topological space and that of a uniform space (<a href="Chapter7.html">chapter 7</a>). The latter notion, which has been formalized relatively recently (<a href="Bibliography.html#bib154">A. Weil [1]</a>), owes much to the study of topological groups.</p>

                <i>CLOSED SETS</i>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">A subset <i>A</i> of a topological space <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is closed iff its relative complement <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> is open. The complement of the complement of the set <i>A</i> is again <i>A</i>, and hence a set is open iff its complement is closed. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the indiscrete topology the complement of <i>X</i> and the complement of the void set are the only closed sets; that is, only the void set and <i>X</i> are closed. It is always true that the space and the void set are closed as well as open, and it may happen, as we have just seen, that these are the only closed sets. If <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the discrete topology, then every subset is closed and open. If <i>X</i> is the set of real numbers and <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> the usual topology, then the situation is quite different. A closed interval (that is, a set of the form {<i>x</i>: <i>a</i> ≦ <i>x</i> ≦ <i>b</i>}) is fortunately closed. An open interval is not closed and a half-open interval (that is, a set of the form {<i>x</i>: <i>a</i> &lt; <i>x</i> ≦ <i>b</i>) or {<i>x</i>: <i>a</i> ≦ <i>x</i> &lt; <i>b</i>) where <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i>) is neither open nor closed. Indeed—(<a href="Chapter1.html#pro1.J">problem 1.J</a>)—the only sets which are both open and closed are the space and the void set.</p>
        <p class="indent">According to the De Morgan formulae, 0.3, the union (intersection) of the complements of the members of a family of sets is the complement of the intersection (respectively union). Consequently, the union of a finite number of closed sets is necessarily closed and the intersection of the members of an arbitrary family of closed sets is closed. These properties characterize the family of closed sets, as the following theorem indicates. The simple proof is omitted.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.4">4 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>Let</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/><i> be a family of sets such that the union of a finite subfamily is a member</i>,<i> the intersection of an arbitrary non-void subfamily is a member</i>,<i> and</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/in40.1.jpg" width="118"/> <i>is a member. Then</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> <i>is precisely the family of closed sets in X relative to the topology consisting of all complements of members of</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/>.</p>
        <p class="h1" id="sec3"><i>ACCUMULATION POINTS</i></p>
        <p class="indent">
            The topology of a topological space can be described in terms of neighborhoods of points and consequently it must be possible to formulate a description of closed sets in terms of neighborhoods. This formulation leads to a new classification of points 
            <a id="page_41"/>
                in the following way. A set <i>A</i> is closed iff <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> is open, and hence iff each point of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> has a neighborhood which is contained in <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>, or equivalently, is disjoint from <i>A</i>. Consequently, <i>A</i> is closed iff for each <i>x</i>, if every neighborhood of <i>x</i> intersects <i>A</i>, then <i>x</i> ε <i>A</i>. This suggests the following definition.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">A point <i>x</i> is an accumulation point (sometimes called cluster point or limit point) of a subset <i>A</i> of a topological space <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> iff every neighborhood of <i>x</i> contains points of <i>A</i> other than <i>x</i>. Then it is true that each neighborhood of a point <i>x</i> intersects <i>A</i> if and only if <i>x</i> is either a point of <i>A</i> or an accumulation point of <i>A</i>. The following theorem is then clear.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.5">5 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>A subset of a topological space is closed if and only if it contains the set of its accumulation points</i>.</p>
        <p class="indentt1">If <i>x</i> is an accumulation point of <i>A</i> it is sometimes said, in a pleasantly suggestive phrase, that there are points of <i>A</i> arbitrarily near <i>x</i>. If we pursue this imagery it appears that an indiscrete topological space is really quite crowded, for each point <i>x</i> is an accumulation point of every set other than the void set and the set {<i>x</i>}. On the other hand, in a discrete topological space, no point is an accumulation point of a set. If <i>X</i> is the set of real numbers with the usual topology a variety of situations can arise. If <i>A</i> is the open interval (0,1), then every point of the closed interval [0,1] is an accumulation point of <i>A</i>. If <i>A</i> is the set of all non-negative rationals with squares less than 2, then the closed interval [0,√2] is the set of accumulation points. If <i>A</i> is the set of all reciprocals of integers, then 0 is the only accumulation point of <i>A</i>, and the set of integers has no accumulation points.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.6">6 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>The union of a set and the set of its accumulation points is closed</i>.</p>
        <p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> If <i>x</i> is neither a point nor accumulation point of <i>A</i>, then there is an open neighborhood <i>U</i> of <i>x</i> which does not intersect <i>A</i>. Since <i>U</i> is a neighborhood of each of its points, no one of these is an accumulation point of <i>A</i>. Hence the union of the set <i>A</i> and the set of its accumulation points is the complement of an open set. ∎</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_42"/>The set of all accumulation points of a set <i>A</i> is sometimes called the derived set of <i>A</i>.</p>
        <p class="h1" id="sec4"><i>CLOSURE</i></p>
        <p class="indent">The closure (<img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>-closure) of a subset <i>A</i> of a topological space <img alt="" class="mid" height="15" src="images/in37.2.jpg" width="33"/> is the intersection of the members of the family of all closed sets containing <i>A</i>. The closure of <i>A</i> is denoted by <i>A</i><sup>–</sup>, or by <i>Ā</i>. The set <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> is always closed because it is the intersection of closed sets, and evidently <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> is contained in each closed set which contains <i>A</i>. Consequently <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> is the smallest closed set containing <i>A</i> and it follows that <i>A</i> is closed if and only if <i>A</i> = <i>A</i><sup>–</sup>. The next theorem describes the closure of a set in terms of its accumulation points.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.7">7 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>The closure of any set is the union of the set and the set of its accumulation points</i>.</p>
        <p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> Every accumulation point of a set <i>A</i> is an accumulation point of each set containing <i>A</i>, and is therefore a member of each closed set containing <i>A</i>. Hence <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> contains <i>A</i> and all accumulation points of <i>A</i>. On the other hand, according to the preceding theorem, the set consisting of <i>A</i> and its accumulation points is closed and it therefore contains <i>A</i><sup>–</sup>. ∎</p>
        <p class="indent">The function which assigns to each subset <i>A</i> of a topological space the value <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> might be called the closure function, or closure operator, relative to the topology. This operator determines the topology completely, for a set <i>A</i> is closed iff <i>A</i> = <i>A</i><sup>–</sup>. In other words, the closed sets are simply the sets which are fixed under the closure operator. It is instructive to enquire: Under what circumstances is an operator which is defined for all subsets of a fixed set <i>X</i> the closure operator relative to some topology for <i>X</i>? It turns out that four very simple properties serve to describe closure. First, because the void set is closed, the closure of the void set is void; and, second, each set is contained in its closure. Next, because the closure of each set is closed, the closure of the closure of a set is identical with the closure of the set (in the usual algebraic terminology, the closure operator is idempotent). Finally, the closure of the union of two sets is <a id="page_43"/>the union of the closures, for (<i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>)<sup>–</sup> is always a closed set containing <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and therefore contains <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> and <i>B</i><sup>–</sup> and hence <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> ∪ <i>B</i><sup>–</sup>; on the other hand, <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> ∪ <i>B</i><sup>–</sup> is a closed set containing <i>A</i> ∪<i> B</i> and hence also (<i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>)<sup>–</sup>.</p>
        <p class="indent">A closure operator on <i>X</i> is an operator which assigns to each subset <i>A</i> of <i>X</i> a subset <i>A<sup>c</sup></i> of <i>X</i> such that the following four statements, the Kuratowski closure axioms, are true.</p>
        <p class="alphat">(a)<span class="padding"/><i>If</i> 0 <i>is the void set</i>, 0<i><sup>c</sup></i> = 0.</p>

        <p class="noindentt">The following theorem of Kuratowski shows that these four statements are actually characteristic of closure. The topology defined below is the topology associated with a closure operator.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.8">8 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>Let</i> <i>c</i> <i>be a closure operator on X</i>, <i>let</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/><i> be the family of all subsets A of X for which A<sup>c</sup></i> = <i>A</i>, <i>and let</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> <i>be the family of complements of members of</i> <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/><i>.

        <p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> Axiom (a) shows that the void set belongs to <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/>, and (d) shows that the union of two members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/>. Consequently the union of any finite subfamily (void or not) of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/>. Because of (b), <i>X</i> ⊂ <i>X<sup>c</sup></i>, so that <i>X</i> = <i>X<sup>c</sup></i>, and the union of the members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> is then <i>X</i>. In view of <a href="Chapter1.html#th1.4">theorem 1.4</a>, it will follow that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a topology for <i>X</i> if it is shown that the intersection of the members of any non-void subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> is a member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/>. To this end, first observe that, if <i>B</i> ⊂ <i>A</i>, then <i>B<sup>c</sup></i> ⊂ <i>A<sup>c</sup></i>, because <i>A<sup>c</sup></i> = [(<i>A</i> ~ <i>B</i>) ∪ <i>B</i>]<i><sup>c</sup></i> = (<i>A</i> ~ <i>B</i>)<i><sup>c</sup></i> ∪ <i>B<sup>c</sup></i>. Now suppose that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/> is a non-void subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inf.jpg" width="8"/> and that <i>B</i> = <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/int2.jpg" width="82"/>. The set <i>B</i> is contained in each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/ina.jpg" width="9"/>, and therefore <img alt="" class="mid" height="16" src="images/int3.jpg" width="298"/>. Since <i>B</i> ⊂ <i>B<sup>c</sup></i> it follows that <i>B</i> = <i>B<sup>c</sup></i> and <img alt="" class="mid" height="13" src="images/in43.1.jpg" width="31"/>.

                <i>INTERIOR AND BOUNDARY</i>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">There is another operator defined on the family of all subsets of a topological space, which is very intimately related to the closure operator. A point <i>x</i> of a subset <i>A</i> of a topological space is an interior point of <i>A</i> iff <i>A</i> is a neighborhood of <i>x</i>, and the set of all interior points of <i>A</i> is the interior of <i>A</i>, denoted <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>. (In the usual terminology, the relation “is an interior point of” is the inverse of the relation “is a neighborhood of.”) It is convenient to exhibit the connection between this notion and the earlier concepts before considering examples.</p>
        <p class="noindentt" id="th1.9">9 T<span class="small">HEOREM</span> <i>Let A be a subset of a topological space X. Then the interior A</i><sup>0</sup><i> of A is open and is the largest open subset of A</i>, <i>A set A is open if and only if A</i> = <i>A</i><sup>0</sup><i>. The set of all points of A which are not points of accumulation of X</i> ~ <i>A is precisely A</i><sup>0</sup><i>. The closure of X</i> ~ <i>A is X</i> ~ <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>.</p>
        <p class="noindentt"><span class="small">PROOF</span> If a point <i>x</i> belongs to the interior of a set <i>A</i>, then <i>x</i> is a member of some open subset <i>U</i> of <i>A</i>. Every member of <i>U</i> is also a member of <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>, and consequently <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> contains a neighborhood of each of its points and is therefore open. If <i>V</i> is an open subset of <i>A</i> and <i>y</i> ε <i>V</i>, then <i>A</i> is a neighborhood of <i>y</i> and so <i>y</i> ε <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>. Hence <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> contains each open subset of <i>A</i> and it is therefore the largest open subset of <i>A</i>. If <i>A</i> is open, then <i>A</i> is surely identical with the largest open subset of <i>A</i> ; hence <i>A</i> is open iff <i>A</i> = <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>. If <i>x</i> is a point of <i>A</i> which is not an accumulation point of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>, then there is a neighborhood <i>U</i> of <i>x</i> which does not intersect <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> and is therefore a subset of <i>A</i>. Then <i>A</i> is a neighborhood of <i>x</i> and <i>x</i> ε <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>. On the other hand, <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> does not intersect <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>, so that no point of <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> is an accumulation point of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>. Finally, since <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> consists of the points of <i>A</i> which are not accumulation points of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>, the complement, <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i><sup>0</sup>, is precisely the set of all points which are either points of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> or accumulation points of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>; that is, the complement is the closure (<i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>)<sup>–</sup>. ∎</p>
        <p class="indent">The last statement of the foregoing theorem deserves a little further consideration. For convenience, let us denote the relative <a id="page_45"/>complement <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i> by <i>A</i>′. Then <i>A</i>″, the complement of the complement of <i>A</i>, is again <i>A</i> (we sometimes say ′ is an operator of period two). The preceding result can then be stated as <i>A</i><sup>0′</sup> = <i>A</i>′<sup>–</sup>, and, it follows, taking complements, that <i>A</i><sup>0</sup> = <i>A</i>′<sup>–</sup>′. Thus the interior of <i>A</i> is the complement of the closure of the complement of <i>A</i>. If <i>A</i> is replaced by its complement it follows that <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> = <i>A</i>′<sup>0</sup>′, so that the closure of a set is the complement of the interior of the complement.<a href="#fn1" id="rfn1">*</a></p>
        <p class="indent">If <i>X</i> is an indiscrete space the interior of every set except <i>X</i> itself is void. If <i>X</i> is a discrete space, then each set is open and closed and consequently identical with its interior and with its closure. If <i>X</i> is the set of real numbers with the usual topology, then the interior of the set of all integers is void; the interior of a closed interval is the open interval with the same endpoints. The interior of the set of rational numbers is void, and the closure of the interior of this set is consequently void. The closure of the set of rational numbers is the set <i>X</i> of all numbers, and the interior of this set is <i>X</i> again. Thus the interior of the closure of a set may be quite different from the closure of the interior; that is, the interior operator and the closure operator do not generally commute.</p>
        <p class="indent">
            There is one other operator which occurs frequently enough to justify its definition. The boundary of a subset <i>A</i> of a topological space <i>X</i> is the set of all points <i>x</i> which are interior to neither <i>A</i> nor <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>. Equivalently, <i>x</i> is a point of the boundary iff each neighborhood of <i>x</i> intersects both <i>A</i> and <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>. It is clear that the boundary of <i>A</i> is identical with the boundary of <i>X</i> ~ <i>A</i>. If <i>X</i> is indiscrete and <i>A</i> is neither <i>X</i> nor void, then the boundary of <i>A</i> is <i>X</i>, while if <i>X</i> is discrete the boundary of every subset is void. The boundary of an interval of real numbers, in the usual topology for the reals, is the set whose only members are the endpoints of the interval, regardless of whether the interval is open, closed, or half-open. The boundary of the

                set of rationals, or the set of irrationals, is the set of all real numbers.

        <p class="indent">It is not difficult to discover the relations between boundary, closure, and interior. The following theorem, whose proof we omit, summarizes the facts.</p>

        <p class="h1" id="sec6"><i>BASES AND SUBBASES</i></p>
        <p class="indent">In defining the usual topology for the set of real numbers we began with the family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> of open intervals, and from this family constructed the topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>. The same method is useful in other situations and we now examine the construction in detail. A family <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> of sets is a base for a topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> iff <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a subfamily of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and for each point <i>x</i> of the space, and each neighborhood <i>U</i> of <i>X</i>, there is a member <i>V</i> of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> such that <i>x</i> ε <i>V</i> ⊂ <i>U</i>. Thus the family of open intervals is a base for the usual topology of the real numbers, in view of the definition of the usual topology and the fact that open intervals are open relative to this topology.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a simple characterization of bases which is frequently used as a definition: A subfamily <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> of a topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is a base for <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> iff each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the union of members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/>. To prove this fact, suppose that <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a base for the topology <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> and that <i>U</i> ε <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>. Let <i>V</i> be the union of all members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> which are subsets of <i>U</i> and suppose that <i>x</i> ε <i>U</i>. Then there is <i>W</i> in <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> such that <i>x</i> ε <i>W</i> ⊂ <i>U</i>, and consequently <i>x</i> ε <i>V</i>. Hence <i>U</i> ⊂ <i>V</i> and since <i>V</i> is surely a subset of <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> = <i>U</i>. To show the converse, suppose <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/in46.1.jpg" width="39"/> and each member of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/> is the union of members of <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/>.

Consequently <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/inb.jpg" width="10"/> is a base for <img alt="" class="mid" height="10" src="images/int.jpg" width="7"/>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Although this is a very convenient method for the construction of topologies, a little caution is necessary because not every <a id="page_47"/>family of sets is the base for a topology.

        <p class="indent">There will generally be many different bases and subbases for a topology and the most appropriate choice may depend on the problem under consideration.

It is clear that each topological space which satisfies the second axiom of countability also satisfies the first; on the other hand, any uncountable discrete topological space satisfies the first axiom (there is a base for the neighborhood system of each point <i>x</i> which consists of the single neighborhood {<i>x</i>}) but not the second (the cover whose members are {<i>x</i>} for all <i>x</i> in <i>X</i> has no countable subcover). The second axiom of countability is therefore definitely more restrictive than the first.</p>

A similar statement, with “closed” replacing “open” everywhere, is also true. However, knowing that a set is open or closed in a subspace generally tells very little about the situation of the set in <i>X</i>. If <i>X</i> is the union of two sets <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i> and if <i>A</i> is a subset of <i>X</i> such that <i>A</i> ∩<i> Y</i> is open in <i>Y</i> and <i>A</i> ∩<i> Z</i> is open in <i>Z</i>, then one might hope that <i>A</i> is open in <i>X</i>. But this is not always true, for if <i>Y</i> is an arbitrary subset of <i>X</i> and <i>Z</i> = <i>X</i> ~ <i>Y</i>, then <i>Y</i> ∩ <i>Y</i> and <i>Y</i> ∩ <i>Z</i> are open in <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i> respectively. There is one important case, in which this result does hold. Two subsets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are separated in a topological space <i>X</i> iff <i>A</i><sup>–</sup> ∩ <i>B</i> and <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i><sup>–</sup> are both void. This definition of separation involves the closure operation in <i>X</i>. However, the apparent dependence on the space <i>X</i> is illusory, for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are separated in <i>X</i> if and only if neither <i>A</i> nor <i>B</i> contains a point or an accumulation point of the other. This condition may be restated in terms of the relative topology for <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>, in view of part (b) of the foregoing theorem, as: both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are closed in <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i> (or equivalently <i>A</i> (or <i>B</i>) is both open and closed in <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>) and <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are disjoint. As an example, notice that the open intervals (0,1) and (1,2) are separated subsets of the real numbers with the usual topology and that there is a point, 1, belonging to the closure of both. However, (0,1) is not separated from the closed interval [1,2] because 1, which is a member of [1,2], is an accumulation point of (0,1).</p>
