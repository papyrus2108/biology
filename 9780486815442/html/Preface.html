<p class="indent">This book is a systematic exposition of the part of general topology which has proven useful in several branches of mathematics. It is especially intended as background for modern analysis, and I have, with difficulty, been prevented by my friends from labeling it: What Every Young Analyst Should Know.</p>
<p class="indent">The book, which is based on various lectures given at the University of Chicago in 1946–47, the University of California in 1948–49, and at Tulane University in 1950–51, is intended to be both a reference and a text. These objectives are somewhat inconsistent. In particular, as a reference work it offers a reasonably complete coverage of the area, and this has resulted in a more extended treatment than would normally be given in a course. There are many details which are arranged primarily for reference work; for example, I have taken some pains to include all of the most commonly used terminology, and these terms are listed in the index. On the other hand, because it is a text the exposition in the earlier chapters proceeds at a rather pedestrian pace. For the same reason there is a preliminary chapter, not a part of the systematic exposition, which covers those topics requisite to the main body of work that I have found to be new to many students. The more serious results of this chapter are theorems on set theory, of which a systematic exposition is given in the appendix. This appendix is entirely independent of the remainder of the book, but with this exception each part of the book presupposes all earlier developments.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_vi"/>There are a few novelties in the presentation. Occasionally the title of a section is preceded by an asterisk; this indicates that the section constitutes a digression. Other topics, many of equal or greater interest, have been treated in the problems. These problems are supposed to be an integral part of the discussion. A few of them are exercises which are intended simply to aid in understanding the concepts employed. Others are counter examples, marking out the boundaries of possible theorems. Some are small theories which are of interest in themselves, and still others are introductions to applications of general topology in various fields. These last always include references so that the interested reader (that elusive creature) may continue his reading. The bibliography includes most of the recent contributions which are pertinent, a few outstanding earlier contributions, and a few “cross-field” references.</p>
<p class="indent">I employ two special conventions. In some cases where mathematical content requires “if and only if” and euphony demands something less I use Halmos’ “iff.” The end of each proof is signalized by ∎. This notation is also due to Halmos.</p>
