<p class="indent">It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to several colleagues.</p>
<p class="indent">The theorems surrounding the concept of even continuity in <a href="Chapter7.html">chapter 7</a> are the joint work of A. P. Morse and myself and are published here with his permission. Many of the pleasanter features of the appended development of set theory are taken from the unpublished system of Morse, and I am grateful for his permission to use these; he is not responsible for inaccuracies in my writing. I am also indebted to Alfred Tarski for several conversations on set theory and logic.</p>
<p class="indent">I owe thanks to several colleagues who have read part or all of the manuscript and made valuable criticisms. I am particularly obliged to Isaku Namioka, who has corrected a grievous number of errors and obscurities in the text and has suggested many improvements. Hugo Ribeiro and Paul R. Halmos have also helped a great deal with their advice.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I tender my very warm thanks to Tulane University and to the Office of Naval Research for support during the preparation of this manuscript. This book was written at Tulane University during the years 1950–52; it was revised in 1953, during tenure of a National Science Foundation Fellowship and a sabbatical leave from the University of California.</p>
