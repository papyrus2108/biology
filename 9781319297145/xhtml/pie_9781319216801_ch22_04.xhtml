<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_a4g1j6vcBt">We have now examined in detail pattern formation in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_yt2OKD9tZA">Drosophila</i>, which serves as a model system of development. Another model system that has provided important insight into how genes influence patterns of growth and development is the formation of flower parts in angiosperms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2QOK3R6Cyq">One of the most important developmental events in the life of a plant is the switch from vegetative growth to flowering. The precise timing of this switch is affected by season, day length, plant size, and a number of other factors and is under the control of a large number of different genes. The development of the flower itself is also under genetic control, and homeotic genes play a crucial role in the determination of the floral structures.</p>

The outermost whorl (whorl 1) consists of the green, leaflike sepals. The next whorl (whorl 2) consists of the petals, which typically lack chlorophyll. Whorl 3 consists of the stamens, which bear pollen, and whorl 4 consists of the carpels, which are often fused to form the stigma bearing the ovules.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_LOl6kr9pJd">The question in this experiment is: How do genes control the development of flower structures? The methods section reads, Isolate and analyze homeotic mutants that affect flower development. The results section shows four types of flowers. Mutant plants that had altered flower structure are examined. The whorls of each plant are represented as simple schematic drawings. Green lines are sepals, pink lines are petals, yellow circles are stamens, and blue horseshoes are carpels. Whorl 1 is the outer layer of the flower and whorl 4 is the inner layer of the flower. In wild-type flowers labeled “a”, whorls 1, 2, 3, and 4 have sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, respectively. The mutant plants were categorized into 3 groups labeled “b” through “d.” Class A mutants labeled “b” developed carpels, stamen, stamen, carpels in whorls 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Class B mutants labeled “c” developed sepals, sepals, carpels, carpels in whorls 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Class c mutants labeled “d” developed sepals, petals, petals, sepals in whorls 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. In conclusion, class A mutants are involved with producing sepals in whorl 1 and petals in whorl 2. Class b mutants are involved with producing petals in whorl 2 and stamens in whorl 3. Class c mutants are involved with producing stamens in whorl 3 and carpels in whorl 4.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UkbRRv4ux3">Elliot Meyerowitz and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s to examine the genetic basis of flower development in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2UbAYTuoMa">Arabidopsis</i>. They began by isolating and analyzing homeotic mutants in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_W407z5MdaP">Arabidopsis</i>. Homeotic mutations were actually first <span aria-label="687" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page687" role="doc-pagebreak" title="687"/>identified in plants in 1894, when William Bateson noticed that the floral parts of plants occasionally appeared in the wrong place: he found, for example, flowers in which stamens grew in the place where petals normally grow.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xgYV5jPCfY">Meyerowitz and his coworkers used these types of mutants to reveal the genes that control flower development. They were able to place the homeotic mutations that they isolated into three groups on the basis of their effect on floral structure. Class A mutants had carpels instead of sepals in the first whorl and stamens instead of petals in the second whorl (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H9IsTeKqo8" id="ben_9781319297145_faHvJTxeeB"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_A63YGqTDSl">Figure 22.15b</strong></a>). The third whorl consisted of stamens, and the fourth whorl consisted of carpels, the normal pattern. Class B mutants had sepals in the first and second whorls and carpels in the third and fourth whorls (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H9IsTeKqo8" id="ben_9781319297145_jqTi6lwQ4f"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_EsJoulX5Yg">Figure 22.15c</strong></a>). The final group, class C mutants, had sepals and petals in the first and second whorls, respectively, as is normal, but had petals in the third whorl and sepals in the fourth whorl (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H9IsTeKqo8" id="ben_9781319297145_77z8O1MAOf"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ZLktfpRYYX">Figure 22.15d</strong></a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XhKyxIWf3V">Meyerowitz and his colleagues concluded that each class of mutants was missing the product of a gene, or the products of a set of genes, critical to proper flower development: class A mutants were missing gene A activity, class B mutants were missing gene B activity, and class C mutants were missing gene C activity. They hypothesized that the class A genes are active in the first and second whorls. Class A gene products alone cause the first whorl to differentiate into sepals, and together with class B gene products, they cause the second whorl to develop into petals. Class C gene products, together with class B gene products, induce the third whorl to develop into stamens. Class C genes alone cause the fourth whorl to become carpels. The products of the different gene classes and their effects are summarized in the conclusion of <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H9IsTeKqo8" id="ben_9781319297145_3ofcOLrk4F">Figure 22.15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9vCpQsIQJF">To explain their results, they also proposed that the genes of some classes affect the activities of others. Where class A is active, class C is repressed, and where class C is active, class A is repressed. Additionally, if a mutation inactivates class A, then class C becomes active, and vice versa. Class A genes are normally expressed in whorls 1 and 2, class B genes are expressed in whorls 2 and 3, and class C genes are expressed in whorls 3 and 4 (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_x6uTo1eUiE" id="ben_9781319297145_4yHASqXAbG"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_E76tLb6If3">Figure 22.16</strong></a>).</p>

The cloning and sequencing of these genes revealed that all are MADS-box genes—genes whose products function as transcription factors and affect the expression of other genes. MADS-box genes in plants play a role similar to that of homeobox genes in animals, although MADS-box genes and homeobox genes are not homologous.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_GS0wJkvtQR">We have now considered two very different model systems of development: the development of body form and pattern in fruit flies and the development of flower structures in angiosperms. In spite of their differences, these two systems exhibit similarities in how genes control development.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xK3oRZqjE1">First, both pattern formation in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_QhNzyHBFw5">Drosophila</i> and flower development in plants are controlled by numerous genes that interact in complex ways. For example, we saw in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1oRI5jT5Y9">Drosophila</i> how a large complex of genes successively defines smaller and smaller regions of the fruit-fly embryo and how genes at one level stimulate and inhibit genes at other levels. Similarly, flower development is controlled by class A, class B, and class C genes. The action of each class depends on which products of other classes are present, and the individual genes of each class interact in complex ways to control the differentiation of each whorl of a flower.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_GHLPiC70H1">Another common feature of development in fruit flies and in flowers is that many of the genes involved in these processes function by influencing the expression of other genes. In both fruit flies and flowers, there is a cascade of development in which gene products stimulate other genes, which in turn stimulate still other genes. Many of the gene products are regulatory proteins that bind to DNA and affect the transcription of other genes. For example, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_99PCOYF0xB">Hox</i> genes in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_iqxkqItUS7">Drosophila</i> and MADS-box genes in flowers encode transcription factors that play an important role in development.</p>
