Many epigenetic effects are caused by changes in gene expression that result from alterations in chromatin structure or other aspects of DNA structure, such as DNA methylation. One definition of an epigenetic trait is a stably inherited phenotype resulting from changes in chromatin without alterations in the DNA sequence. Some have broadened the definition of epigenetics to refer to any alteration of chromatin or DNA structure that affects gene expression. Here, we will use <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_V3pF3HbXsl">epigenetics</i> to refer to changes in gene expression or phenotype <span aria-label="653" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page653" role="doc-pagebreak" title="653"/>that are potentially heritable but that do not alter the underlying DNA base sequence.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RLiwBNmyFB">Many epigenetic changes are stable, persisting across cell divisions or even generations. However, epigenetic alterations can also be influenced by environmental factors. For example, environmental stress has been shown to alter methylation of the rat <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Sd7AOvmVC6">Bdnf</i> gene, which encodes a growth factor that plays an important role in brain development. DNA methylation has been tied to the expression of genes and the phenotypes they produce. As we will see, altered DNA methylation is capable of being replicated across cell division, resulting in progeny with the new phenotype; however, there is no corresponding difference in the DNA base sequence of individuals that “inherit” the new phenotype. The fact that epigenetic traits may be induced by environmental effects and transmitted to future generations has been interpreted by some to mean that, through epigenetics, genes have memory—that environmental factors acting on individuals can have effects that are transmitted to future generations, as was seen with the effect of diet on obesity and cardiovascular disease in the introduction to this chapter. Epigenetics has been called “inheritance, but not as we know it.”</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_44VVuTFAZA">Epigenetics is providing an explanation for how changes outside the DNA sequence can influence the phenotype and how those changes can be heritable. It is also making important contributions to the study of behavior, environmental science, cancer, neurobiology, and pharmacology. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_bnVxIWl6Bh">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_XZoESh5i8R" id="ben_9781319297145_kTXbqZChKG">PROBLEM 2</a></strong></p>
