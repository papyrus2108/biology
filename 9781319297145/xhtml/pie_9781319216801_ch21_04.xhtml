<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_CFZ7MMk4vY">Initially, epigenetic mechanisms were thought to play a role in a small number of unusual phenotypes. However, research has now revealed that epigenetics underlies an impressive and ever-increasing array of biological phenomena. In this section, we look at epigenetic modifications that influence developmental processes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lf0dg0eCV1">All cells in the human body are genetically identical, and yet different cell types exhibit remarkably different phenotypes—a nerve cell is quite distinct in its shape, size, and function from an intestinal cell. These differences in phenotypes are stable and are passed from one cell to another, despite the fact that the DNA sequences of all the cells are the same.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YuSgb7PDnP">Stem cells provide a potential source of cells for the regeneration of tissues, medical treatment, and research. In the past, embryos were the only source of stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into adult tissues, but because of ethical concerns about creating and using human embryos for harvesting stem cells, researchers have long sought the ability to induce adult somatic cells to dedifferentiate and revert to stem cells. Such cells are called

Researchers have now successfully created iPSCs by treating fibroblasts (fully differentiated human connective-tissue cells) in culture with a cocktail of transcription factors (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kESFhgQ2N3" id="ben_9781319297145_GKIQphFOte"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Bp6pJ2Cxa2">Figure 21.7</strong></a>), although less than 1% of the cells that are treated in this way actually revert to iPSCs. Transcription factors that induce pluripotency cause extensive epigenetic reprogramming, altering the patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications that accumulate with cell differentiation. Research has shown, however, that iPSCs retain a memory of their past and are not completely equivalent to embryonic stem cells (those derived from embryos). One study found that although the DNA methylation patterns of iPSCs differ greatly from those of differentiated somatic cells, the iPSCs retained some methylation marks of the somatic cells, and the methylation of iPSCs was not identical to that of embryonic stem cells. Another study compared histone modifications of fibroblasts, iPSCs, and embryonic stem cells. The iPSCs and embryonic stem cells had fewer H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks than the fibroblasts did, but researchers also found significantly more of these marks on the iPSCs than on the embryonic stem cells.</p>

Three pictures of endodermal cells are drawn: lung, thyroid, and pancreatic cells. 5 types of mesodermal cells are drawn: cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, tubule cells of the kidney, red blood, and smooth muscle cells (in gut). 3 types of ectodermal cells are drawn: neuron, skin cells of epidermis, and pigment cells.

Surprisingly, paramutation produces these changes in phenotype without any alteration in the DNA base sequence of the converted allele. The phenomenon of paramutation has several important features. First, the newly established expression pattern of the converted allele is transmitted to future generations, even when the allele that brought about the alteration is no longer present. Second, the altered allele is now able to convert other alleles to the new phenotype. And third, there are no associated DNA sequence changes in the altered alleles. A number of examples of paramutation have now been discovered in different organisms, and geneticists have begun to unravel the molecular mechanism of this curious phenomenon.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZGNxuC4H4C">Early in the development of female mammals, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly inactivated to provide equal expression of X-linked genes in males and females (dosage compensation; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_f2TMw9nQp4" id="ben_9781319297145_XaYgj6obbK">Section 4.3</a>). Through this <span aria-label="661" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page661" role="doc-pagebreak" title="661"/>process, termed X inactivation, many genes on the inactivated X chromosome are permanently silenced and are not transcribed. Once a particular X chromosome is inactivated in a cell, that same X chromosome remains inactivated when the DNA is replicated, and the inactivation mark is passed on to daughter cells through mitosis. This phenomenon is responsible for the patchy distribution of black and orange pigment seen in tortoiseshell cats (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_X14xNCrkay" id="ben_9781319297145_30MpSefUa3">Figure 4.19</a>).

As its name implies, this RNA molecule does not encode a protein. Instead, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_L1ZYEPg6c5">Xist</i> lncRNA coats the X chromosome from which it was transcribed. <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_iCel2ujUo1">Xist</i> lncRNA then attracts Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and, later, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_urF4VgOTvT">In mice, there are two separate inactivation events. Soon after fertilization, when the embryo reaches the eight-cell stage, the X chromosome from the male parent is inactivated, while the maternal X chromosome remains active. This event is called imprinted X-chromosome inactivation. In the developing embryo, the paternal X chromosome is then reactivated during blastocyst maturation. Inactivation occurs again in early development, but now which X is inactivated is random: the X from the male parent and the X from the female parent are equally likely to be inactivated. From this point on, whichever X is inactivated remains silenced through subsequent cell divisions. However, some genes on the inactivated X chromosome escape inactivation and continue to be transcribed. How these genes escape X inactivation is not known. Interestingly, in marsupial mammals, the paternal X <span aria-label="662" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page662" role="doc-pagebreak" title="662"/>chromosome is the copy that remains permanently silenced in all cells.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_USDRun6BKf">Epigenetic changes underlie X inactivation, in which one X chromosome in female cells is permanently silenced. X inactivation occurs through the action of several genes in the X-inactivation center that encode long noncoding RNAs. The products of these genes interact to ensure that one X chromosome is inactive and one remains active in each female cell.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_GsMTF6Rrjb">Diploid organisms usually possess two alleles at each autosomal locus, with one allele inherited from the mother and one allele inherited from the father. For most genes, both alleles are expressed, and the effect of a particular allele on the phenotype is independent of which parent transmitted that allele to the offspring. However, for some genes, the sex of the parent that contributed the allele influences how that allele is expressed—alleles inherited from the mother and from the father are not equivalent (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TDpqJw9ZtG" id="ben_9781319297145_JvXjX5oOi7"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_alkJWSEXeT">Figure 21.12</strong></a>). This phenomenon, in which the sex of the parent that transmits the allele determines its expression, is termed genomic imprinting. For some imprinted genes, when the allele is inherited from the male parent, it is expressed, but when it is inherited <span aria-label="663" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page663" role="doc-pagebreak" title="663"/>from the female, it is silent; for other genes, when the allele is inherited from the female parent, it is expressed, but when it is inherited from the male, it is silent. As discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YAVhRTEVr8" id="ben_9781319297145_ITmLxVGQIV">Section 5.3</a>, genomic imprinting is thought to be due to different degrees of methylation of the alleles inherited from the two parents.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ImfDPyAlSE">An interesting example of genomic imprinting involves crosses between a horse and a donkey. A cross between a male donkey and a female horse produces a mule, but a cross between a female donkey and a male horse produces a hinny. Mules and hinnies differ in appearance, physiology, and behavior; for example, hinnies are smaller than mules, have shorter ears, and have stronger legs. Because both mules and hinnies have the same genetic makeup (half donkey and half horse) and differ only in which sex conveys the horse and donkey genes, their differences are thought to be due to genomic imprinting. Studies of RNA levels in mules and hinnies demonstrate that they do indeed exhibit differential expression of some genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xJl6qiC6CU">Previous research had suggested that the number of imprinted genes was limited, but more recent research suggests that the number is much higher than those suggested limits. A study conducted by Christopher Gregg, at Harvard University, and his colleagues found that over 1300 genes in the mouse brain exhibited evidence of genomic imprinting. Many of these imprinted genes were not completely silenced; instead, there was biased expression, with one sex transmitting an allele that was more highly expressed than the allele transmitted by the other sex. Gregg and his colleagues also found that imprinting was highly variable; some genes were imprinted only in certain tissues or at certain times of development.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kiGaGrjXsg">Genomic imprinting has a number of interesting parallels to X inactivation. Most imprinted genes are located in clusters of 3–12 genes that occur in a discrete region of a particular chromosome. Each cluster contains genes that encode proteins as well as genes that produce noncoding RNA. In each of the well-studied examples, there is an imprinting control region that determines imprinting; deletion of this region destroys the ability to imprint. In addition, the imprinting control region exhibits differences in chromatin modifications between alleles inherited from the male and female parents. Each imprinting cluster contains genes for one or more lncRNAs, which play an important role in imprinting and are themselves imprinted. For example, the gene for insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_oopujgYQsr">Igf2</i>) in humans exhibits genomic imprinting; the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_V41Zs7lyov">Igf2</i> allele transmitted from the male parent is expressed, while the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_U295zZgExX">Igf2</i> allele transmitted from the female parent is silenced (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_DASMUVvu93" id="ben_9781319297145_OctcPIUqnJ">Figure 5.18</a>). Several lncRNAs produced by other genes in the imprinting control region are required for silencing of the female <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TldLzQQhi8">Igf2</i> allele in the fetus, although how they bring about the repression of transcription is not clear.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Gk9xVVPTuT">Many of the well-studied clusters of imprinted genes are associated with disorders that result from faulty imprinting. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is one such disorder. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome exhibit excessive growth during fetal development and early childhood. They also have unusual embryonic malignant tumors. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with imprinting in a cluster of genes on chromosome 11, including the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_AUT5cjapJj">Igf2</i> gene. Individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome often have small deletions on chromosome 11 that interfere with the normal process of imprinting. For example, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_MuLeb9pY6j">Igf2</i> is normally expressed only when inherited from the father, but in some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, deletions within the imprinting center lead to the expression of alleles from both parents. The result is that too much <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_JyVYQ4DwRt">Igf2</i> is produced, leading to excessive growth and cancer. Prader–Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are disorders that occur due to imprinting defects on chromosome 15 (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YAVhRTEVr8" id="ben_9781319297145_tAv3Iz1I8P">Section 5.3</a>).</p>

From an evolutionary standpoint, paternal alleles that maximize the size of the offspring are favored because birth weight is strongly associated with infant survival and adult health. Thus, it is to the advantage of the male parent to pass on alleles that promote maximum fetal growth in his offspring. In contrast, maternal alleles that cause more limited fetal growth are favored because committing too many nutrients to any one fetus may limit a mother’s ability to reproduce in the future, and giving birth to very large babies is also difficult and risky. The genetic conflict hypothesis predicts that genomic imprinting will evolve such that paternal copies of genes that increase fetal growth will be maximally expressed, whereas maternal copies of the same genes will be less actively expressed or even silent. Indeed, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_bdrLN7DCsn">Igf2</i> follows this pattern: the paternal allele is active and promotes growth; the maternal allele is silent and does not contribute to growth. Recent findings demonstrate that the paternal copy of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xPZZcaoZhC">Igf2</i> promotes fetal growth by directing maternal nutrients to the fetus through the placenta.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_SXHGengroA">Monozygotic (identical) twins develop from a single egg fertilized by a single sperm that divides and gives rise to two zygotes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_zCGw2eqSG8" id="ben_9781319297145_C1P127L8Nu">Section 6.3</a>). Thus, monozygotic twins are genetically identical, in the sense that they possess identical DNA sequences, but they often differ somewhat in appearance, health, and behavior. The nature of these differences in the phenotypes of identical twins is not well understood, but evidence suggests that at least some of these differences may be due to epigenetic changes. In one study, Mario Fraga, at the Spanish National Cancer Center, and his colleagues examined 80 pairs of identical twins and compared the degree and location of their DNA methylation and histone acetylation. They found that DNA methylation and histone acetylation in identical twin pairs were similar early in life, but that older twin pairs had remarkable differences in their overall content and distribution of DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Furthermore, these differences affected gene expression in the twins. This research suggests that identical twins do differ epigenetically and that phenotypic differences between them may be caused by differential gene expression.</p>
