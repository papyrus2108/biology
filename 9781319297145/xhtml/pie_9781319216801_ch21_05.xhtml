<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_CL1NFD67Bh">Research studies demonstrate that epigenetic modifications are affected by and influence a number of important functions in life, including maternal behavior, response to stress, cognition, reproduction, and metabolism.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lPh7nPpxFQ">Research has shown that life experiences, especially those early in life, can have long-lasting effects on behavior, in some cases into future generations. Increasingly, researchers are finding that these long-term effects are mediated through epigenetic processes. The number of studies that convincingly demonstrate that life experience alters chromatin structure is currently small (and some are still controversial), but a number of researchers are actively looking for the epigenetic effects of experience and their long-term effects on chromatin structure and behavior.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_wxNuqf747u">A fascinating example of behavioral epigenetics is seen in the long-lasting effects of maternal behavior in rats. A mother rat licks and grooms her offspring (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_U6VHXLz1O3" id="ben_9781319297145_KV4p48scYP"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_iH7WDUPDWV">Figure 21.13</strong></a>), usually while she arches her back and nurses them. The offspring of mothers who display more licking and grooming behavior are less fearful as adults and show reduced hormonal responses to stress compared with the offspring of mothers who lick and groom less. These long-lasting differences in the offspring are not due to genetic differences inherited from their mothers—at least not genetic differences in the base sequences of their DNA. Offspring exposed to more licking and grooming develop a different pattern of DNA methylation than do offspring exposed to less licking and grooming. These differences in DNA methylation affect the acetylation pattern of histone proteins. The altered acetylation pattern persists into adulthood and alters the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, which plays a role in hormonal responses to stress. The expression of other stress-response genes is also affected.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kIaiD7txut">To demonstrate the effect of altered chromatin structure on the stress responses of the offspring, researchers infused the brains of young rats with a deacetylase inhibitor, which prevents the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins. After the infusion of the deacetylase inhibitor, differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation associated with maternal grooming behavior disappeared, as did the difference in responses to fear and stress in the young rats when they reached adulthood. This study demonstrates that the mother rat’s licking and grooming behavior brings about epigenetic changes in the offspring’s chromatin, which causes long-lasting differences in their behavior.<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_stXo7x4kg7">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_zjOj93Vdxa" id="ben_9781319297145_rYBg3z8tOI">PROBLEM 31</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zAimGUZ5QG">Numerous studies have demonstrated that stress during childhood and adolescence produces a number of adverse effects that persist into adult life. For example, childhood abuse increases the probability that the child will experience depression, anxiety, and suicide as an adult. In one study, researchers examined the brains of 24 people who had committed suicide, half of whom had experienced childhood abuse. They found that those who had experienced childhood abuse had a greater degree of methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, a gene involved in the stress response, than those who had not. Although the number of brains studied was small, the study suggests that early childhood stress can indeed cause epigenetic modifications to chromatin structure in humans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_GotzlrRGYU">Other studies have demonstrated that gene expression is affected by early life experience. For example, researchers found that children who grew up in a lower socioeconomic environment before the age of 5 showed the altered expression of over 100 genes related to immune function as adults.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_w1LOKhnIKM">Research in mice suggests that the epigenetic effects of stress may be mediated by small RNA molecules. In these studies, male mice were subjected to chronic stresses, such as restraint, the odor of a predator, or noise. After they were exposed to the stress, the males were bred to females who had experienced no stress. Their offspring displayed a blunted hormonal response when stressed by restraint, a response called reduced hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) stress axis reactivity. Furthermore, these offspring exhibited an altered expression of the genes involved in the stress response.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UxZnhlRVox">The researchers found increased levels of nine miRNAs in the stressed fathers’ sperm, which they believed conveyed the blunted hormonal response to the offspring. To test this hypothesis, they injected copies of these specific miRNAs into mouse embryos, whose parents had not been exposed to stressful conditions, and implanted the embryos into surrogate mothers. When these mice grew up, they exhibited the same blunted hormonal response as the offspring of the stressed fathers, even though their parents had never been exposed to stressful conditions. Appropriate controls were included to ensure that the observed effect was not simply due to the injection procedure. The results demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the epigenetic transmission of the altered hormonal response across generations. Using RNA sequencing to examine levels of transcription (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_XIbMlXhiOf" id="ben_9781319297145_j7qbtJMl9p">Section 20.2</a>), the researchers also showed that the miRNAs brought about changes in gene expression associated with the altered stress response. Other studies have found that fragments of tRNAs passed through sperm similarly bring about epigenetic effects of diet that are passed from male mice to their offspring.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4C8VGU34gJ">A number of research studies have shown that abnormalities in DNA methylation are associated with disorders of development and intellectual ability in humans. These findings prompted researchers to look for the effects of chromatin structure on learning, memory, and cognitive ability in mice and rats. One study found that training mice to avoid an aversive stimulus reduced DNA methylation of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xnjZ11Nmok">Bdnf</i> gene, which encodes a growth factor that stimulates the growth of connections between neurons. When demethylated, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kH39OJhDUi">Bdnf</i> gene was <span aria-label="666" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page666" role="doc-pagebreak" title="666"/>more active. When researchers injected a drug that inhibits demethylation into the brains of the trained mice, activity of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xNJ9u4iyx2">Bdnf</i> gene was decreased, and the mice’s memories of where the adverse stimulus occurred also decreased.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fuYJCnMszI">Another study found that a drug that promotes the acetylation of histone proteins improved learning and memory in mice that have a disorder similar to Alzheimer disease. Recall that the acetylation of histones alters chromatin structure by loosening the association of DNA with histone proteins and stimulates the transcription of many genes. Other studies have found that histone acetylation decreases with age in mice, resulting in diminished expression of genes related to learning and memory. When researchers injected mice with a drug that is an inhibitor of deacetylase activity, the acetylation of histones increased, the transcription of genes involved in memory increased, and the memories of the mice improved. These studies suggest that changes in chromatin structure may be involved in memory and learning.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_TULqrOzCFW">Because some chemicals are capable of modifying chromatin structure, researchers have looked for long-term effects of environmental toxicants on chromatin structure and epigenetic traits.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kJr4vPU1LM">There has been much recent interest in chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which mimic or interfere with natural hormones. Endocrine disruptors are capable of interfering with processes regulated by natural hormones, such as sexual development and reproduction. One of these endocrine disruptors is vinclozolin, a common fungicide used to control fungal diseases in vegetables and fruits—particularly wine grapes—and to treat turf on golf courses. Vinclozolin acts as an antagonist at the androgen receptor; that is, vinclozolin and its metabolites mimic testosterone and bind to the androgen receptor, preventing testosterone from binding. But vinclozolin and its metabolites do not properly activate the receptor, and in this way, vinclozolin inhibits the action of androgens and prevents sperm production.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kFCXABLZ08">In one study, researchers found that the exposure of embryonic male rats to vinclozolin led to reduced sperm production—not only in the treated animals when they reached puberty but also in several subsequent generations. Increased DNA methylation was seen in the sperm of the males that were exposed to vinclozolin, and these patterns of methylation were inherited by the offspring of those males. This study and others have raised concerns that through epigenetic changes, environmental exposure to some chemicals might have effects on the health of future generations. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_mBpsi9cICn">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8fCGYVKxAc" id="ben_9781319297145_FHSce1RXkJ">PROBLEM 32</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_BhbNtZIbPd">In the introduction to this chapter, we saw that nutrition during prenatal development can have effects on health in later life. These types of epidemiological studies on humans are supported by laboratory studies of mice and rats. In one study, researchers fed inbred male mice either a normal (control) diet or a diet low in protein. They then bred mice in both groups to control females that were fed a normal diet. The males were then separated from the females and never had any contact with their offspring; their only contribution to the offspring was a set of paternal genes transferred through the sperm.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CqGHCzQ7bC">Researchers raised the offspring and then examined their cholesterol levels. The offspring of males fed a low-protein diet exhibited increased expression of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism, and a corresponding decrease in levels of cholesterol, compared with the offspring of males fed a normal diet. The researchers also observed numerous differences in DNA methylation in the offspring of the two groups of fathers, although no differences could be found in the methylation patterns of the sperm of the two groups of fathers. These results suggest that epigenetic changes altered the cholesterol metabolism of the offspring, although how the differences in methylation were transmitted from father to offspring was unclear.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9usAq4UEQd">In another study, researchers fed male rats a high-fat diet and, not surprisingly, the rats gained weight. The researchers then bred these males to females that had been fed a normal diet. The offspring were also fed a normal diet. The daughters of the male rats on the high-fat diet had normal weight, but as adults they developed a diabetes-like condition of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. The researchers observed that in the insulin-secreting pancreatic islet cells of the daughters, the expression of 642 genes involved in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance was altered, demonstrating that a father’s diet affected gene expression in his daughters.</p>
