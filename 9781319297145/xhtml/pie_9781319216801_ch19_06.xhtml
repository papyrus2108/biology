Sequencing allows the genetic information in DNA to be read, providing an enormous amount of information about gene structure and function. In the mid-1970s, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues created the dideoxy-sequencing method, which is based on the elongation of DNA by DNA polymerase; at about the same time, Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert developed a second method based on chemical degradation of DNA. The Sanger method quickly became the standard procedure for sequencing any purified fragment of DNA.</p>

From this test tube, four separate test tubes branch. One has d d A T P, one has d d C T P, one has d d G T P, and one has d d T T P. These lead to four different sequences with the template strand as follows: Test tube with d d A T P shows four strands as follows: 1, template; 2, G A T T C G A G C T G A; 3, G A T T C G A; 4, G A. Test tube with d d C T P shows three strands as follows: 1, template; 2, G A T T C G A G C; 3, G A T T C. Test tube with d d G T P shows five strands as follows: 1, template; 2, G A T T C G A G C T G; 3, G A T T C G A G; 4, G A T T C G; 5, G. Test tube with d d T T P shows four strands as follows: 1, template; 2, G A T T C G A G C T; 3, G A T T; 4, G A T. All these strands lead to a sequence of bands formed on gel electrophoresis. The heading reads, “A, C, G, and T”. The right vertical axis of the band sequence shows the sequence of complementary strand followed by the sequence of original template strand. The bands are shown from top to bottom as follows: A G T C G A G C T T A G. The captions in the illustration read as follows: “Each of four reactions contains: single-stranded target D N A to be sequenced, a primer, all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, D N A polymerase, and one type of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (d d N T P). Nucleotides are added to the 3 prime end of the primer, with the target D N A being used as a template. When a d d N T P is incorporated into the growing chain, synthesis terminates because the d d N T P lacks a 3 prime-O H group. Synthesis terminates at different positions on different strands, which generates a set of D N A fragments of various lengths, each ending in a d d N T P with the same base. The fragments produced in each reaction are separated by gel electrophoresis. The sequence can be read directly from the visualized bands, starting from the bottom. The sequence obtained is the complement of the original template strand.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zokHOsGzLN">Within each of the four tubes, the DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA. Let’s consider the reaction in one of the four tubes: the one that received ddATP. Within this tube, each of the single strands of target DNA serves as a template for DNA synthesis. The primer pairs with its complementary sequence at one end of each template strand, providing a 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_klBIKOoPdn">′</sup>-OH group for the initiation of DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase elongates a new strand of DNA from this primer. Wherever DNA polymerase encounters a T on the template strand, it uses, at random, either a dATP or a ddATP to introduce an A into the newly synthesized strand. Because there is more dATP than ddATP in the reaction mixture, dATP is incorporated most often, allowing DNA synthesis to continue. Occasionally, however, ddATP is incorporated into the strand, and synthesis terminates. The incorporation of ddA into a new strand occurs randomly at different positions in different copies, producing a set of DNA fragments of different lengths (12, 7, and 2 nucleotides long in the example illustrated in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_gq3tEYlZdd" id="ben_9781319297145_m5oMH6xL7i">Figure 19.17</a>), each ending in a nucleotide that contains adenine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_it9P1s3vJy">Equivalent reactions take place in the other three tubes except that synthesis is terminated at nucleotides with a different base in each tube. After the completion of the polymerization reactions, all the DNA in the tubes is denatured, and the single-stranded products of each reaction are separated by gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_I6xrqV4miD">The contents of the four tubes are separated side by side on an acrylamide gel (which allows finer separation than <span aria-label="591" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page591" role="doc-pagebreak" title="591"/>agarose) so that DNA strands differing in length by only a single nucleotide can be distinguished.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xWzjCrkglT">For many years, DNA sequencing was done largely by hand and was laborious and expensive.

The dideoxy-sequencing reaction can also be used here, but the ddNTPs used in the reaction are labeled with fluorescent dyes, and a different colored dye is used for each type of ddNTP. In this case, the four sequencing reactions can take place in the same test tube and can be placed in the same well for electrophoresis. The sequencing devices carry out electrophoresis in gel-containing capillary tubes. The different-sized fragments produced by the sequencing reaction separate within a tube and migrate past a laser beam and detector. As the fragments pass the laser, their fluorescent dyes are activated. Each colored dye emits fluorescence of a characteristic wavelength, which is read by an optical scanner. The information is fed into a computer for interpretation, and <span aria-label="592" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page592" role="doc-pagebreak" title="592"/>the results are printed out as a set of peaks on a graph (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ERsSiGc21N" id="ben_9781319297145_e1mEPgkMh6">Figure 19.18</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yUeD6Oi1H8">Illumina sequencing is the most widely used sequencing technology at the present time. It employs a technology that is similar in principle to that used in dideoxy sequencing. Special deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) that have a fluorescent tag attached are used, with a differently colored tag for each type of dNTP. Each dNTP also has a chemical group (a terminator) that, once incorporated into the growing DNA chain, prevents the incorporation of any additional nucleotides. This is similar to termination caused by dideoxyribonucleotides in Sanger sequencing. In this case, however, the terminator is reversible—it can be chemically removed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_0JNIrZG4jv">To carry out sequencing, the target DNA is first cleaved into millions of short overlapping fragments. The fragments are attached to a surface of a reaction chamber called a flow cell and then amplified, creating clusters of up to 1000 copies of each fragment in close proximity on the surface. The fragments are then denatured, and a solution of primers, DNA polymerase, and the special nucleotides is added. The primer attaches to each DNA template, and the first nucleotide is incorporated into the newly synthesized strand (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_z2JKm5ypvN"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_D7oFhel5Co" id="ben_9781319297145_OprhcOnJ0B">Figure 19.19</a></strong>). The solution is washed away, and the tag on the incorporated nucleotide is excited with a laser, which causes it to fluoresce. Each type of nucleotide (A, T, G, or C) has a differently colored fluorescent tag, so the color of the light produced reveals the type of nucleotide just added. The terminator and the fluorescent tag are then chemically removed, and the process is repeated. As the nucleotides are added one at a time, the sequence is read as a series of flashes of colored light from each cluster of DNA. Hundreds of thousands of DNA clusters, each consisting of copies of a different DNA fragment, are sequenced simultaneously, allowing large amounts of DNA to be sequenced in a short time.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_EcK9PCvbot">Even more advanced sequencing methods, typically called <span aria-label="593" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page593" role="doc-pagebreak" title="593"/>third-generation sequencing technologies, are now being used. These technologies, also called single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, determine the sequence of single molecules of DNA or RNA and allow much longer fragments to be sequenced (produce longer reads), which simplifies the assembly of fragments into a complete genome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2c5H8e27UU" id="ben_9781319297145_BW3SgKmgXn">Chapter 20</a>). These technologies are called real-time sequencing because the methods do not require a pause between the addition of each nucleotide, as occurs in next-generation processes such as Illumina sequencing. Some third-generation sequencing technologies can also sequence types of DNA that are difficult to sequence with next-generation sequencing platforms, such as DNA with modified bases or with certain base compositions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Th4gF6WQLc">The third-generation sequencing method called PacBio—named after the company, Pacific Bio-Sciences, that helped develop and market the technology—analyzes DNA synthesis of single molecules of DNA. To carry out PacBio sequencing, DNA is broken into fragments. Adaptors are attached to the ends of each fragment, creating a closed circle of DNA (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_CV7uem8kGi"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LaVUhWI44i" id="ben_9781319297145_8q9ACkqeYD">Figure 19.20</a></strong>). The DNA molecules are then loaded onto a specially made chip, which contains over 100,000 very small sequencing chambers called zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). Each ZMW holds the smallest volume in which light detection can occur. A single DNA molecule with the adaptors diffuses into a ZMW. Anchored at the bottom of the ZMW is a molecule of DNA polymerase, which binds to the adaptor at the end of the DNA circle and begins to carry out replication. The four types of dNTPs, each with a differently colored fluorescent label, are added to the chip. As a dNTP is held by the DNA polymerase within the ZMW before it is added to the newly synthesized DNA strand, the dNTP emits <span aria-label="594" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page594" role="doc-pagebreak" title="594"/>a pulse of light, the color of which reveals the type of base being added. The fluorescence label is cleaved off, and the next nucleotide is added. As synthesis proceeds, the pulses of light in the ZMWs are recorded by a computer, which translates the pulses into the base sequence of the fragment. Synthesis of different fragments is occurring simultaneously in thousands of ZMWs on a chip, so sequencing is rapid.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CkUSZYgYfS">Because the template is circular, when the DNA polymerase reaches the end of the fragment, it proceeds around the adaptor and sequences the other strand. If the polymerase enzyme is active long enough, the same fragment can be sequenced multiple times, increasing the accuracy of the sequence record. Limitations of PacBio sequencing include higher error rates, a slower sequencing time, and a higher cost than next-generation sequencing methods. The biggest advantage is long read lengths. Average read lengths for PacBio sequencing are over 10,000 bp, and some are up to 60,000 bp. In comparison, maximum read lengths for Illumina sequencing are usually a few hundred base pairs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_0SIyDzOGUD">Another third-generation sequencing technology is nanopore sequencing, which uses a completely different method. Here, a single strand of DNA is passed through a tiny hole—a nanopore—in a membrane. As the molecule passes, one nucleotide at a time, through the nanopore, it disrupts an electrical current in the membrane, and the nature of the disruption is affected by the shape of the nucleotide passing through the nanopore. Each of the four bases of DNA causes a characteristic disruption, so the sequence of DNA can be read by analyzing the membrane current as the strand passes, one nucleotide at a time, through the nanopore. Hundreds of thousands of nanopores can be created on a single chip, so many DNA fragments can be read simultaneously. Like PacBio sequencing, nanopore sequencing allows for longer reads but has a much higher error rate.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_HHdjeTvePu">In 2018, nanopore sequencing was used to sequence the entire genomes of 15 different <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XpEiM3U7je">Drosophila</i> species at a cost of about $1,000 per genome.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8KzzlGUn7z">In a typical application, DNA fingerprinting might be used to confirm that a suspect was present at the scene of a crime. A sample of DNA from blood, semen, hair, or some other body tissue is collected from the crime scene. If the sample is very small, PCR can be used to amplify it so that enough DNA is available for testing. Additional DNA samples are collected from one or more suspects. The pattern of DNA fragments produced by DNA fingerprinting of the sample is then compared with the pattern produced by DNA fingerprinting of the DNA from the suspect. A match between the sample and a suspect can provide evidence that the suspect was present at the scene of the crime (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_dx1U8AI47c"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_huddEcMDX5" id="ben_9781319297145_mTXNQmDeB2">Figure 19.23</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QvAqwVnCnl">Since its introduction in the 1980s, DNA fingerprinting has helped convict a number of suspects in murder and rape cases. Suspects in other cases have been proved innocent when their DNA failed to match that from the crime scenes. Today, DNA fingerprinting has become widely accepted as an important tool in forensic investigations. In addition to its application in solving crimes, DNA fingerprinting is used to assess paternity, study genetic relationships among individual organisms in natural populations, identify specific strains of pathogenic bacteria, and identify human remains.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_eaIwmfMwxg">On the morning of September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked two passenger planes and flew them into the World Trade Center towers in New York City. The catastrophic damage and ensuing fire led to the complete collapse of both towers, killing almost 3000 building occupants and rescue personnel. The tremendous destructive force generated by the collapse of the towers pulverized many of the bodies beyond recognition.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_S7DicxXx7Q">In the days immediately following the World Trade Center collapse, forensic scientists began the task of identifying the remains of those who had perished. This task was unprecedented in scope and difficulty. In all, almost 20,000 individual remains were found, varying from whole bodies to tiny fragments of charred bone. The remains had been subjected to fires with temperatures exceeding 1000°C that burned for more than 3 months. The collapse of the buildings intermixed many victims’ remains, and many body fragments were not recovered for months, during which time they were exposed to dust, water, bacteria, and decay. The usual means of victim identification—personal items, fingerprints, dental records—were of little use for most of the World Trade Center remains. Identification of the majority of the remains was made with the use of DNA fingerprinting (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_kreyV8YcLU"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sJhS2W29yi" id="ben_9781319297145_8yWdcIOwnY">Figure 19.24</a></strong>).</p>

</figcaption>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LD33y4oIbK">DNA was first extracted from the tissue samples, and PCR was used to amplify STR loci in the CODIS system (see previous section). The DNA fingerprint generated from each sample was compared with that of DNA extracted from reference samples, such as victims’ toothbrushes and blood samples. If the DNA from a tissue sample had the same alleles at all 13 loci as the reference sample, then a positive identification was made. When no reference sample was available, investigators collected DNA from victims’ family members and tried to match the DNA profiles of remains to <span aria-label="597" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page597" role="doc-pagebreak" title="597"/>those of relatives; in this case, some, but not all, STR alleles would match.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_c9ddI2vRN7">For remains that were too badly degraded to amplify all STR loci, DNA fingerprinting was also carried out on mitochondrial DNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_bo6QReFaBF">Chapter 11</a>). Because there are many mitochondria per cell and each mitochondrion contains multiple DNA molecules, there are many more copies of mitochondrial DNA per cell than nuclear DNA. Alone, fingerprinting from mitochondrial DNA was insufficient to provide identification with a high degree of confidence (because there are not as many sequences that vary among people as in the CODIS loci), but when it was used in conjunction with data from at least some STR loci, a positive identification could often be made. Used in combination, these techniques allowed the remains of over half of the victims to be positively identified.</p>
