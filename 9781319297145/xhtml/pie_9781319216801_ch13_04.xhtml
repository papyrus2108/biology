<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Tjy88QhD4R">Now that we’ve considered some of the major components of transcription, we’re ready to take a detailed look at the process. Transcription can be conveniently divided into three stages:</p>
<ol class="numbered-list" id="ben_9781319297145_QC219SyZwD">

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Mvqh7JfrDQ">Initiation comprises all the steps necessary to begin RNA synthesis, including (1) promoter recognition, (2) formation of a transcription bubble, (3) creation of the first bonds between rNTPs, and (4) escape of the transcription apparatus from the promoter.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hU38PqptFR">Transcription initiation requires that the transcription apparatus recognize and bind to the promoter. At this step, the selectivity of transcription is enforced: the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter determines which parts of the DNA template are to be transcribed, and how often. Different genes are transcribed with different frequencies, and promoter binding is important in determining the frequency of transcription for a particular gene. Promoters also have different affinities for RNA polymerase. Even within a single promoter, affinity for RNA polymerase can vary with the passage of time, depending on the promoter’s interaction with RNA polymerase and a number of other factors.</p>

As the transcription apparatus moves down the template, it generates positive supercoiling ahead of the transcription bubble and negative supercoiling behind it. Topoisomerase enzymes probably relieve the stress associated with the unwinding and rewinding of DNA in transcription, as they do in DNA replication.</p>

Research has demonstrated that RNA polymerase is capable of a type of proofreading in the course of transcription. When RNA polymerase incorporates a nucleotide that does not match the DNA template, it backtracks and cleaves the last two nucleotides (including the misincorporated nucleotide) from the growing RNA chain. RNA polymerase then proceeds forward, transcribing the DNA template again.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_A4vO6VUFk2">Transcription is a selective process; only certain parts of the DNA are transcribed at any one time.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_VUBZX6uS12">RNA is transcribed from a single strand of DNA. Within a gene, only one of the two DNA strands—the template strand—is usually copied into RNA.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_pBYGS3Rg77">Ribonucleoside triphosphates are used as the substrates in RNA synthesis. Two phosphate groups are cleaved from a ribonucleoside triphosphate, and the resulting nucleotide is joined to the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_5peu23Nx3I">′</sup>-OH group of the growing RNA strand.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_OrqqrSodzr">The transcribed RNA molecule is antiparallel and complementary to the DNA template strand. Transcription is always in the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_iRufOyFovD">′</sup>→3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_Ed7Mw5fGxu">′</sup> direction, meaning that the RNA molecule grows at the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_TwoSNyL8PA">′</sup> end.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_edggpOuzg3">Transcription depends on RNA polymerase, a large multimeric enzyme. RNA polymerase consists of a core enzyme, which is capable of synthesizing RNA, and other subunits that may join transiently to perform additional functions.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_XYC0EbTdtV">A sigma factor enables the core enzyme of RNA polymerase to bind to a promoter and initiate transcription.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_cifF7l2b1Q">Promoters contain short sequences crucial to the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA; these consensus sequences are interspersed with nucleotides that play no known role in transcription.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_n79vY0wrXi">RNA polymerase binds to DNA at a promoter, begins transcribing at the start site of the gene, and ends transcription after a terminator has been transcribed.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_bg036uuYOc">Topoisomerase enzymes remove supercoiling that develops ahead of and behind the transcription bubble as the DNA is unwound and rewound during transcription.</li>
