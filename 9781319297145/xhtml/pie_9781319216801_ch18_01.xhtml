<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_brTbwer1uf">Lou Gehrig was the finest first baseman ever to play major league baseball. A left-handed power hitter who grew up in New York City, Gehrig played for the New York Yankees from 1923 to 1939. Throughout his career, he lived in the shadow of his teammates Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, but Gehrig was a great hitter in his own right: he compiled a lifetime batting average of .340 and drove in more than 100 runs every season for 13 years. During his career, he batted in 1991 runs and hit a total of 23 grand slams (home runs with bases loaded). But Gehrig’s greatest baseball record, which stood for more than 50 years and has been broken only once—by Cal Ripken, Jr., in 1995—is his record of playing 2130 consecutive games.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VFG51mqB5b">In the 1938 baseball season, Gehrig fell into a strange slump. For the first time since his rookie year, his batting average dropped below .300, and in the World Series that year, he managed only four hits—all singles. Nevertheless, he finished the season convinced that he was undergoing a temporary slump that he would overcome in the next season. He returned to training camp in 1939 with high spirits. When the season began, however, it was clear to everyone that something was terribly wrong. Gehrig had no power in his swing; he was awkward and clumsy at first base. His condition worsened, and on May 2, he voluntarily removed himself from the lineup. The Yankees sent Gehrig to the Mayo Clinic for diagnosis. On June 20, his medical report was made public: Lou Gehrig was suffering from a rare, progressive disease known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Within two years, he was dead. Since then, ALS has commonly been known as Lou Gehrig disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_InNyaONw5e">Gehrig experienced symptoms typical of ALS: progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles due to degeneration of the motor neurons. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, appearing in people with no family history of the disease. However, about 10% of cases run in families, and in these cases the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. ALS shares a number of features in common with another neurological disease called frontotemporal dementia (FTD); in fact, FTD occurs alongside ALS in some families, suggesting a common genetic basis underlying these two disorders.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_i7MjMVjbZu">Mutations in several genes can cause familial cases of ALS and FTD, the most common of which occur in a gene on chromosome 9 called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ds0LB2fNMi">chromosome 9 open reading frame 72</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_KAcEkodUBi">C9orf72</i>). The alterations of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1uvPxosWSF">C9orf72</i> that are associated with ALS and FTD belong to an unusual group of mutations called expanding nucleotide repeats, in which the number of copies of a set of nucleotides is increased. Most people have somewhere between 2 and 23 repeats of the nucleotide sequence GGGGCC in their <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_COcaxPWCxH">C9orf72</i> gene, but this number is <span aria-label="526" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page526" role="doc-pagebreak" title="526"/>massively expanded in some people with ALS, who typically possess 700 to 1600 repeats of the sequence.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9zkm4huHzX">How the expansion of the GGGGCC repeat in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_hY9h3jxKNM">C9orf72</i> leads to symptoms of ALS and FTD is unknown, but recent research demonstrates that the repeats are translated into one or more proteins that are toxic to nerve cells. The repeats are translated in an unusual and intriguing way: the GGGGCC sequences on both the template and the nontemplate strands of the gene are transcribed into RNAs that are translated without a start codon. Because there is no start codon to set the reading frame, all three reading frames on both mRNAs are translated into proteins, resulting in five proteins, each with a different series of repeating dipeptides: glycine-alanine, glycine-proline, proline-alanine, glycine-arginine, and proline-arginine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9SvGfvXBG4">To determine how the repeats might produce the disease, geneticists engineered a series of premature stop codons into the template and nontemplate strands of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2bXuI1KJkP">C9orf72</i> gene so that RNA would be transcribed from the repeats but, because of the engineered stop codons, would not be translated into a protein. They inserted both the original repeat sequence and the engineered repeat sequence into fruit flies. The unaltered repeats caused neurodegeneration and early death in the fruit flies, but the engineered repeats had no effect. These results suggest that the toxicity of the repeat sequence was the result of the protein it encoded and not simply a product of the RNA alone (although the RNA may also be somewhat toxic). Further research suggested that proteins with the glycine-arginine and proline-arginine dipeptides are responsible for the neurodegeneration that occurs in ALS and FTD. The toxicity of these proteins may result from the fact that they mimic RNA-binding proteins and interfere with splicing of pre-mRNA and the processing of rRNA. This research provides important insight into the pathology of these diseases and suggests possible future targets for treatment.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_TXSieClPDS">The story of ALS and expanding nucleotide repeats illustrates the central importance of studying mutations: the analysis of mutants is often a source of key insights into diseases and important biological processes. This chapter focuses on gene mutations—on how these errors in genetic instructions arise and how they are studied. We begin with a brief examination of the different types of mutations, including their phenotypic effects, how they can be suppressed, and their rates of occurrence. The next section explores how mutations can arise spontaneously during and after the course of DNA replication, as well as how chemicals and radiation can induce them. After discussing the analysis of mutations, we turn to transposable elements: DNA sequences that are capable of moving within the genome and that often produce mutations when they do so. Finally, we take a look at DNA repair and some of the diseases that arise when DNA repair is defective.</p>
