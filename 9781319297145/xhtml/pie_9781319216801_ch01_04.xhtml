<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_d6FvurAQ8R">Undoubtedly, you learned some genetic principles in other biology classes. Let’s take a few moments to review some fundamental genetic concepts.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_6BuyRKVqls">Structurally, cells consist of two basic types, although evolutionarily, the story is more complex (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_NZHP3ur6NH">Chapter 2</a>). Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane and do not generally possess membrane-bounded organelles, whereas eukaryotic cells are more complex, possessing a nucleus and membrane-bounded organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_S3UolDwgvq">The precise way in which a gene is defined often varies depending on the biological context. At the simplest level, we can think of a gene as a unit of information that encodes a genetic characteristic. We will expand this definition as we learn more about what genes are and how they function.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_7Hk0JroHGu">A gene that specifies a characteristic may exist in several forms, called alleles. For example, a gene for coat color in cats may exist as an allele that encodes black fur or as an allele that encodes orange fur.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_L9fNSwsYDh">One of the most important concepts in genetics is the distinction between traits and genes. Traits are not inherited directly. Rather, genes are inherited, and genes, along with environmental factors, determine the expression of traits. The genetic information that an individual organism possesses is its genotype; the trait is its phenotype. For example, the albinism seen in some Hopis is a phenotype, and the information in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xBaWGW8EKi">OCA2</i> genes that causes albinism is a genotype.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_0Wenw5Rbn3">Genetic information is encoded in the molecular structure of nucleic acids, which come in two types: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Nucleic acids are polymers consisting of repeating units called nucleotides; each nucleotide consists of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are of four types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The sequence of these bases encodes genetic information. DNA consists of two complementary nucleotide strands. Most organisms carry their genetic information in DNA, but a few viruses carry it in RNA. The four nitrogenous bases of RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil (U).</p>

The cells of each species have a characteristic number of chromosomes; for example, bacterial cells normally possess a single chromosome, human cells possess 46, and pigeon cells possess 80. Genes are located on chromosomes; each chromosome carries a large number of genes.</p>

Mitosis is the separation of chromosomes in the division of somatic (nonsex) cells. Meiosis is the pairing and separation of chromosomes in the division of sex cells to produce gametes (reproductive cells).</p>
