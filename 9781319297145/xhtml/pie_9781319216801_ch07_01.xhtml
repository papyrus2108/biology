<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_LODVHHCtbN">Our Labrador retriever, Molly, is the most laid-back dog I’ve ever known. Molly doesn’t understand the definition of a stranger and greets all visitors to our house with a vigorous wag of her tail. She is equally amiable toward other dogs. Confronted with an aggressive dog, she simply rolls over on her back. Nothing seems to make her anxious or fearful. She even loves going to the veterinarian, where she greets other dogs and the staff with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xHHX8dNTg5">Not all dogs are so inclined, and indeed some breeds are consistently more aggressive and fearful than others. Fear and aggression have played important roles in dog evolution: compared to wild wolves, all domestic dogs have reduced aggression and fear toward humans, and early humans undoubtedly selected for tameness when they first domesticated dogs from their wolf ancestors some 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FQv0tWSy6G">For many years, geneticists have been interested in the genetic underpinnings of behavioral traits like fear and aggression, not just in dogs but also in humans. This information could potentially be used to treat behavioral illnesses in humans that include fear, anxiety, and aggression. Unfortunately, studying the genetic basis of behavioral variation in humans is challenging because of the complexity of behavioral traits, long generation time, the inability to conduct controlled crosses, and small family size (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TnCspasvqI" id="ben_9781319297145_KA7ALxK2D5">Chapter 6</a>). Thus, geneticists have recently turned to dogs as a model for understanding how genes affect behavior.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TYPsXaJo0O">In 2016, Isain Zapata and his colleagues published the results of a study that mapped genes affecting fear and aggression in dogs. To locate genes involved in these behaviors, they conducted a genome-wide association study, in which they looked for statistical associations between behavioral traits among dogs from 11 breeds and 175,000 genetic markers called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced “snips”). Scattered across the genome, SNPs are positions at which individuals differ in a single nucleotide. (The details of locating genes with genome-wide association studies are discussed later in this chapter). Genome-wide association studies in dogs are facilitated by the fact that dogs in different breeds are genetically distinct, while dogs within breeds are genetically similar.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CtFARvSc1l">What the researchers found was that fear in the dogs toward human strangers, as well as aggression toward both strange humans and unfamiliar dogs, was associated with genetic markers at two specific places in the genome: one spot on chromosome 18 and another on the X chromosome. Interestingly, aggression toward the dogs’ owners <span aria-label="180" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" role="doc-pagebreak" title="180"/>appeared to have a different genetic cause and was associated with different genes on chromosomes 15 and 34. The researchers were able to correlate these chromosomal locations to several known genes, some of which are expressed in those portions of the brain that are known to be associated with fear and aggression. These genes also showed signatures of strong past selection, suggesting that through artificial selection during dog domestication, humans helped shape the variation found today at these genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pDW5DwaHLa">To validate their findings, the researchers conducted another study on a different cohort of dogs, and results confirmed their earlier finding of associations of loci on chromosomes 18 and X with fear and aggression directed toward strangers and other dogs. Finally, the researchers used their genetic results to create a model that, based on genetic makeup, could predict fear and aggression in dogs, and tested this model in a third group of dog breeds. The model had a 58% success rate of predicting the level of fear and aggression observed in the dog breeds based on the particular genetic variants they possessed, versus a 7% random chance of success.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_kvSDZwcgtr">This chapter explores the inheritance of genes and genetic markers located on the same chromosome. These linked genes do not strictly obey Mendel’s principle of independent assortment; rather, they tend to be inherited together. This tendency requires a new approach to understanding their inheritance and predicting the types of offspring that will be produced by a cross. A critical piece of information necessary for making these predictions is the arrangement of the genes on the chromosomes; thus, it will be necessary to think about the relation between genes and chromosomes. A key to understanding the inheritance of linked genes is to make the conceptual connection between the genotypes in a cross and the behavior of chromosomes in meiosis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6f1rsdAxnW">We begin our exploration of linkage by comparing the inheritance of two linked genes with the inheritance of two genes that assort independently. We then examine how recombination breaks up linked genes. Next, we use our knowledge of linkage and recombination for predicting the results of genetic crosses in which genes are linked as well as for mapping genes. Later in the chapter, we focus on physical methods of determining the chromosomal locations of genes. The final section examines variation in rates of recombination.</p>
