<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_IkmRlDDnDd">In the preceding sections, we learned about the powerful molecular techniques that are available for amplifying, isolating, recombining, and sequencing DNA. Although these techniques provide a great deal of information about the organization and nature of gene sequences, the ultimate goal of many molecular studies is to better understand the function of these sequences. In this section, we explore some advanced molecular techniques that are frequently used to determine the functions of genes and to better understand the genetic processes that these sequences undergo.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UjJ8HBEkos">The traditional approach to the study of gene function begins with the identification of mutant organisms. For example, suppose a geneticist is interested in genes that affect cardiac function in mammals. A first step would be to find individuals—perhaps mice—that have hereditary defects in heart function. The mutations causing the cardiac problems in the mice could then be mapped, and the implicated genes could be isolated and sequenced. The proteins produced by the genes could then be predicted from the gene sequences and isolated. Finally, the biochemistry of the proteins could be studied and their role in heart function discerned. This approach, which begins with a phenotype (a mutant individual) and proceeds to a gene that encodes the phenotype, is called

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kedUDmy0C5">An alternative approach is to begin with a genotype—a DNA sequence—and proceed to the phenotype by altering the sequence or inhibiting its expression. A geneticist might begin with a gene of unknown function, induce mutations in it, and then observe the effect of these mutations on the phenotype of the organism. This approach is called

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ENSwBKlgkf">Forward genetics depends on the identification and isolation of random mutations that affect a phenotype of interest. Early in the study of genetics, geneticists were forced to rely on naturally occurring mutations, which are usually rare and can be detected only if large numbers of organisms are examined. The discovery of mutagens—environmental factors that increase the rate of mutation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_yMkbTg9peo" id="ben_9781319297145_Hezz46I9rx">Section 18.2</a>)—provided a means of increasing the number of mutants in experimental populations of organisms. One of the first examples of experimentally created mutations was Hermann Muller’s use of X-rays in 1927 to induce X-linked mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_G8gFoWPb4G">Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pPdqioCcNb">Today, radiation, chemical mutagens, and transposable elements are all used to create mutations for genetic analysis. To determine all genes that might affect a phenotype, it is desirable to create mutations in as many genes as possible—that is, to saturate the genome with mutations. This procedure, known as a mutagenesis screen, will be described in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2c5H8e27UU" id="ben_9781319297145_JiZYvdICpi">Chapter 20</a>.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XQCy1hY0ZQ">A number of different strategies have been developed for targeted mutagenesis. The CRISPR-Cas9 system (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Z30p0WEvXC" id="ben_9781319297145_krjEZeBn9n">Section 19.2</a>) can be used to create mutations at specific sites. Single guide RNAs are designed to be complementary to a target sequence. The sgRNA and Cas9 are inserted into a cell, where Cas9 is guided to the target site by the sgRNA and makes double-stranded cuts at the site. Short duplications and deletions are often introduced when the cuts are repaired by nonhomologous end joining. Alternatively, donor DNA containing a specific desired mutation can be provided along with CRISPR-Cas9; the donor DNA will be inserted at the target site by homology directed repair.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sWhF7O2b8q">Another strategy, called

The success of this method depends on the availability of restriction sites flanking the sequence to be altered.</p>

In this method, a single-stranded oligonucleotide is produced that differs from the target sequence by one or a few bases. Because they differ in only a few bases, the target DNA and the oligonucleotide will pair. When successfully paired with the target DNA, the oligonucleotide can act as a primer to initiate DNA synthesis, which produces a double-stranded molecule with a mismatch in the primer region. When this DNA is transferred to bacterial cells, the mismatched bases will be repaired by bacterial enzymes. About half of the time, the normal bases will be changed into mutant bases, and about half of the time, the <span aria-label="598" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page598" role="doc-pagebreak" title="598"/>mutant bases will be changed into normal bases.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Ag94R1QFrs">The oocytes of mice and other mammals are large enough that DNA can be injected into them directly. Immediately after penetration by a sperm, a fertilized mouse egg contains two pronuclei, one from the sperm and one from the egg; these pronuclei later fuse to form the nucleus of the embryo. Mechanical devices can manipulate extremely fine, hollow glass needles to inject DNA directly into one of the pronuclei of a fertilized egg (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_vUUdN9WOg4"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Fg2LPWOXRC" id="ben_9781319297145_k9VmjbCUMP">Figure 19.27</a></strong>). Typically, a few hundred copies of cloned, linear DNA are injected into a pronucleus. In a few of the injected eggs, copies of the cloned DNA integrate randomly into one of the chromosomes through a process called nonhomologous recombination. Today, researchers often use CRISPR-Cas, injecting one or more sgRNAs, along with mRNA for Cas9, into mice embryos (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Z30p0WEvXC" id="ben_9781319297145_uepkAax9FA">Section 19.2</a>). The Cas9 enzyme is produced within the embryo, combines with the sgRNA, and is targeted to a specific DNA sequence, where it carries out precise cleavage of the DNA. Nonhomologous end joining produces insertions and deletions in the edited <span aria-label="599" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page599" role="doc-pagebreak" title="599"/>DNA, producing knockouts (see next section). Alternatively, a piece of double-stranded DNA with a specific DNA sequence can also be injected along with the sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA; homology directed repair may insert the donor DNA sequence into the break. Gene editing has also been accomplished by using viruses to carry the CRISPR-Cas9 components into mouse embryos instead of injecting them.</p>

Nevertheless, if several hundred embryos are injected and implanted, there is a good chance that one or more mice whose chromosomes contain the foreign DNA will be born. Moreover, because the DNA was injected at the one-cell stage of the embryo, these mice usually carry the cloned DNA in every cell of their bodies, including their reproductive cells, and will therefore pass the foreign DNA on to their progeny.

There are a number of ways to disable a gene, but a common method is to insert a gene called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_lgTdfdA8XT">neo</i>, which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418, into the middle of the target gene (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_WpeF37mUWA"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_txpXor8joQ" id="ben_9781319297145_3tHapY9Xd3">Figure 19.28</a></strong>). The insertion of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_WKqYj9dTuv">neo</i> both disrupts the target gene and provides a convenient marker for finding copies of the disabled gene. In addition, a second gene, usually the herpes simplex viral thymidine kinase (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XXfvvT33Up">tk</i>) gene, is linked to the disabled gene. The disabled gene is then transferred to cultured mouse embryonic cells, where it may exchange places with the normal copy on the mouse chromosome through homologous recombination.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_q4g5tAxnaq">The experiment starts with a question: “How can the function of a gene be determined?” The Methods section shows a D N A possessing a target gene. Neo superscript positive gene is added in between the target sequence and t k superscript positive gene is added at one end. A caption reads, “A normal gene is disabled by inserting the neo superscript positive gene. The t k superscript positive gene is linked to the target gene, and the disabled gene is transferred to embryonic mouse stem cells where the disabled copy recombines with the normal gene on the mouse chromosome. The recombinant chromosome is neo superscript positive and t k superscript negative.” This leads to a petri dish having embryonic stem cells from a black mouse. An arrow from these cells shows a D N A labeled transferred sequence. It shows D N A similar to the earlier D N A, but with a curve on the neo superscript positive gene. It recombines with mouse chromosome having the target gene. Homologous recombination takes place. The chromosome now lacks the t k superscript positive gene. Mouse neo superscript positive cells are grown from it in a petri dish. A caption reads, “The cells are grown on a medium that contains the antibiotic G 418 and gancyclovir; only cells that received the neo superscript positive gene but not the t k superscript positive gene by homologous recombination survive.” The illustration then shows white mouse embryos being injected with a needle. A downward arrow leads to a mouse. A caption reads, “Cells containing a neo superscript positive disabled gene are then injected into early mouse embryos, which are implanted into a pseudopregnant mouse.” This mouse gives rise to a mouse with black spots. A caption reads, “Variegated progeny contain a mixture of normal cells and cells with the disabled gene.” It is crossed with a white mouse and produces a black mouse. A caption reads, “Variegated mice are crossed with white mice and the progeny interbred to produce some mice that are homozygous for the knocked-out gene.” Text at the bottom reads, “Conclusion: Through this procedure, mice that contain no functional copy of the gene—that is, the gene is knocked out—are produced. The phenotype of the knockout mice reveals the function of the gene.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_e2NvJhxdtJ">After the disabled gene has been transferred to the embryonic cells, the cells are screened by adding the antibiotic G418 to their growth medium. Only cells with the disabled gene containing the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rxirNepMRr">neo</i> insert will survive. Because the frequency of nonhomologous recombination is higher than that of homologous recombination and because the intact target gene is replaced by the disabled copy only through homologous recombination, a means to select for the rarer homologous recombinants is required. The presence of the viral <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_MV10tq6c6v">tk</i> gene makes the cells <span aria-label="600" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page600" role="doc-pagebreak" title="600"/>sensitive to the antimicrobial gancyclovir. Thus, transfected cells that grow on a medium containing G418 and gancyclovir contain the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3knuELJJJe">neo</i> gene (and thus the disabled target gene) but not the adjacent <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BvNKhslpRO">tk</i> gene, because the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Kk5ieSAmBS">tk</i> gene has been eliminated in the double-crossover event. These cells contain the desired homologous recombinants. The nonhomologous recombinants (random insertions) contain both the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_LVGyfGJomB">neo</i> and the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_5fDdqQIRjA">tk</i> genes, and these transfected cells die on the selection medium owing to the presence of gancyclovir. The surviving cells are injected into an early-stage mouse embryo, which is then implanted into a pseudopregnant mouse. Cells in the embryo carrying the disabled gene and normal embryonic cells carrying the wild-type gene will develop together, producing a chimera—a mouse that is a genetic mixture of the two cell types. The production of chimeric mice is not itself desirable, but replacing all the cells of the embryo with injected cells is impossible.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FgURkiPFPm">Chimeric mice can be easily identified if the injected embryonic cells came from a black mouse and the embryos into which they are injected came from a white mouse; the resulting chimeras will have variegated black and white fur. Some of the chimeras may have the knockout gene in their germ-line cells and can transmit it to the next generation. The chimeras are crossed to white mice; any black progeny are heterozygous for the knockout. The black progeny can then be intercrossed to produce some progeny that are homozygous for the knockout gene. The effects of disabling a particular gene can be observed in these homozygous mice. Three scientists who helped develop the original techniques for creating knockout mice—Mario Capecchi, Oliver Smithies, and Martin Evans—were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2007 for their work.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LWIq3goO5a">Additional techniques have been developed for knocking out genes only in certain tissues or at certain times; the resulting mice are called conditional knockouts. A variant of the knockout procedure is to insert a particular DNA sequence at a known chromosome location. For example, researchers might insert the sequence of a human disease-causing allele into the same locus in mice, creating a precise mouse model of the human disease.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_g8i6WbtolX">In the preceding sections, we have seen that introducing mutations or new DNA sequences into the genome and observing the resulting phenotypes can provide information about the function of the altered or introduced DNA. We can also analyze gene function by temporarily turning a gene off and observing the effect of the absence of the gene product on the phenotype. For many years, there was no such method for selectively affecting gene expression. However, the discovery of siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) and miRNAs (microRNAs; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_aEtZzPSLWb">Chapters 14</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_iI2aKKFlNl">17</a>) has provided powerful tools for controlling the expression of individual genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9hwvWR3tJB">Recall that siRNAs are small RNA molecules that combine with proteins to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In a process called RNA interference, or RNAi, the RISC pairs with complementary sequences on mRNA and either cleaves the mRNA or prevents it from being translated. Molecular geneticists have exploited this natural machinery for turning off the expression of specific genes. The effect of silencing a gene with siRNAs can often be a source of insight into the gene’s function.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LHIWwDD0sa">The first step in using RNAi technology is to design siRNAs that will be recognized and cleaved by Dicer (the protein that processes siRNAs; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TUZBFLs6AG" id="ben_9781319297145_GWIdw8GIWM">Section 14.5</a>). The complementary sequence must be unique to the target mRNA and must not be found on other mRNAs, so that the siRNA will not inhibit nontarget mRNAs. Computer programs are often used to design optimal siRNAs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5IbzntIxCh">After the siRNA sequence has been designed, it must be synthesized. One way to create an siRNA is to use an oligonucleotide synthesizer to synthesize a DNA fragment corresponding to the siRNA sequence. The synthesized oligonucleotide can be cloned into a plasmid expression vector between two strong promoters (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_mYBU0bzFdG"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_vFXLohUnNV" id="ben_9781319297145_HfscfM8Szo">Figure 19.29</a></strong>). <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_KU7x5D5J8C">Escherichia coli</i> are then transformed with the plasmid. Within the bacteria, transcription from the two promoters will proceed in both directions, producing two complementary RNA molecules that will pair to form a double-stranded RNA molecule recognized by Dicer. Alternatively, double-stranded RNA sequences can be synthesized directly.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_b8MJ98A8tG">The next task is to deliver the double-stranded siRNA to the target cells. Delivery can be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending on the cell type. The model genetic organism <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_uHC1GcmOY7">Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_reference_guide_03.xhtml#pageA6" id="ben_9781319297145_fwOoGOW3PH">p. A6</a>) can be fed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_VnLRlSCpRh">E. coli</i> (their natural food) containing the expression vector. Transcription within the bacteria produces double-stranded RNA, which the worms ingest and incorporate into their cells. Alternatively, double-stranded siRNA can be injected directly into the cells or the body cavity. Yet another approach is to synthesize a short sequence of DNA that has internal complementarity so that, when transcribed, its RNA product folds up into a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) with a double-stranded section. Within a cell, the shRNAs are processed by Dicer to produce siRNAs that bring about gene silencing. DNA sequences containing siRNAs can be introduced into a vector using standard cloning techniques, and the vector can be used to deliver the DNA to a cell. An advantage of this approach is that with the addition of a DNA sequence, the RNAi sequence has the potential to become a permanent part of the cell’s genome and be passed on to progeny.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ivAxI06iPG">One of the major advantages of siRNA for controlling gene expression is that it acts in trans—that is, a single copy of an siRNA gene will shut down expression of both copies of the target gene. Another advantage is that the target gene remains intact, and therefore the silencing effects are reversible. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_o5v0heUYDU">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_10.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2Qap2Hzh1B" id="ben_9781319297145_L7TlkHvkfo">PROBLEM 52</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_s1mSlUa49b">Research has examined the potential of RNAi for the treatment of cholesterol metabolism disorders. Although cholesterol is essential for life, too much cholesterol is unhealthy: high blood cholesterol is a major contributor to heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Cholesterol is normally transported throughout the body in the form of small particles called lipoproteins, which consist of a core of lipids surrounded by a shell of phospholipids and proteins (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ov4WnfcPtT" id="ben_9781319297145_g7CyrBBDMd">Figure 6.6</a>). The ApoB protein is an essential part of lipoproteins. Some people possess genetic mutations that cause elevated levels of ApoB, which predispose them to coronary artery disease. Findings from studies suggest that lowering the amount of ApoB can reduce the number of lipoproteins and lower blood cholesterol in these people, as well as in people who have elevated cholesterol for other reasons.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_v58AbbC9Jy">In 2006, Tracy Zimmermann and her colleagues at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Protiva Biotherapeutics demonstrated that RNAi could be used to reduce the levels of ApoB and blood cholesterol in nonhuman primates. The investigators first created siRNAs that targeted <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_yldMlfuktq">apoB</i> gene expression (apoB-siRNAs) on the basis of the known sequence of the gene. The apoB-siRNAs were synthesized in <span aria-label="602" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page602" role="doc-pagebreak" title="602"/>the laboratory and consisted of 21 nucleotides on the sense strand (the strand that was complementary to the apoB mRNA) and 23 nucleotides on the complementary antisense strand, with a two-nucleotide overhang.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_WHOAlkbJjX">The next task was to get the apoB siRNAs into the animals’ cells. Although siRNAs are readily taken up by the cells of invertebrates such as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rtMiDWslhJ">C. elegans</i>, most siRNAs will not readily pass through the membranes of mammalian cells in a form that is still effective in gene silencing. In addition, siRNAs are rapidly removed from circulation. To overcome these problems, Zimmermann and her colleagues encapsulated the apoB siRNAs in lipids, creating stable nucleic-acid–lipid particles (SNALPs). The SNALPs greatly increased the time spent by the siRNAs in circulation and enhanced their uptake by the cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RAUacutpNM">The researchers then tested the effects of the apoB-siRNAs on the synthesis of the ApoB protein and on cholesterol levels. They injected cynomolgus monkeys (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_GQJVRnR7Pq"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qmw6Rbjq1Q" id="ben_9781319297145_zsqlGF9vIY">Figure 19.30a</a></strong>) with SNALPs containing apoB siRNAs at two doses: 1 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg. In addition, they injected a third group of monkeys with saline as a control. The apoB siRNAs clearly silenced the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_mICk8WmdYq">apoB</i> gene: 48 hours after treatment, apoB mRNA in the liver was reduced by 68% for monkeys receiving the 1-mg dose and 90% for monkeys receiving the 2.5-mg dose.</p>
