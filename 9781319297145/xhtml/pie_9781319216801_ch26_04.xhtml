Cladogenesis occurs through speciation, the process by which one population separates into two distinct evolutionary groups.</p>

In many cases, species differences are easy to recognize: a horse is clearly a different species than a chicken. Sometimes, however, species differences are not so clear. Some species of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nBraJzN0Yl">Plethodon</i> salamanders are so similar in appearance that they can be distinguished only by looking at their proteins or genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Y3GvNnm7q9">The concept of a species has two primary uses in biology. First, a species is a particular type of organism to which a unique name has been given. For effective communication, biologists must use a standard set of names for the organisms that they study, and species names serve that purpose. When a geneticist talks about conducting crosses with <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jCwkMhZqX9">Drosophila melanogaster</i>, other biologists immediately understand which organism was used. The second use of the term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xIoMl52Xpd">species</i> is in an evolutionary context: a species is considered an evolutionarily independent group of organisms.</p>

<dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="ben_9781319297145_QRqnB3VMXA"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_glossary.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_WDwghGbwR6" id="ben_9781319297145_1WzWCtIveQ" role="doc-glossref">biological species concept</a></dfn>, first fully developed by evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1942. Mayr was primarily interested in the biological characteristics that are responsible for separating organisms into independently evolving units. He defined a species as a group of organisms whose members are capable of interbreeding with one <span aria-label="803" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page803" role="doc-pagebreak" title="803"/>another but are reproductively isolated from the members of other species. In other words, members of the same species have the biological potential to exchange genes, and members of different species cannot exchange genes. Because different species do not exchange genes, each species evolves independently.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_D7yTQJmaSR">Not all biologists adhere to the biological species concept, and there are several problems associated with it. For example, reproductive isolation, on which the biological species concept is based, cannot be determined from fossils, and in practice, it is often difficult to determine whether even living species are biologically capable of exchanging genes. There are many examples of organisms that are accepted as different species that sometimes exchange genes, or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_29stMT6PnU">hybridize</i> (see the introduction to this chapter). Furthermore, the biological species concept cannot be applied to asexually reproducing organisms, such as bacteria. In practice, many species are distinguished on the basis of phenotypic (usually anatomical) differences. Biologists often assume that phenotypic differences represent underlying genetic differences; if the phenotypes of two organisms are quite different, then they probably cannot and do not interbreed in nature.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_v26JPyZVK0">Because of these problems, some biologists have proposed alternative definitions for a species. For example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZXqx0jS66s">morphospecies concept</i> defines a species entirely on the basis of phenotypic (morphological) similarities and differences. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gktF8s3GKj">phylogenetic species concept</i> defines a species as the smallest recognizable group that has a unique evolutionary history. In this chapter, we use the biological species concept because it is widely used and is based on reproductive differences.</p>

Because they never come into contact, these birds are reproductively isolated from one another. Other species are separated by

Geographic barriers can take a number of forms. Uplifting of a mountain range may split a population of lowland plants into separate groups on each side of the range. Oceans serve as effective barriers for many types of terrestrial organisms, separating individuals on different islands from one another and from those on the mainland. Rivers often separate populations of fish located in separate <span aria-label="805" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page805" role="doc-pagebreak" title="805"/>drainages.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kdvtgktpST">If the geographic barrier that once separated the two populations disappears, or if individuals are able to disperse over it, the populations come into secondary contact (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZRFcBxncUS" id="ben_9781319297145_FWqxZcXM5u"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_46K6rwJSPN">Figure 26.5c</strong></a>). At this point, several outcomes are possible. If limited genetic differentiation has taken place during the separation of the populations, reproductive isolating mechanisms may not have evolved or may be incomplete. Genes will flow between the two populations, eliminating any genetic differences that did arise, and the populations will remain a single species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZpRlzvcrgB">A second possible outcome is that genetic differentiation during separation has led to prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms; in this case, the two populations have become different species. A third possible outcome is that during their time apart, some genetic differentiation has taken place between the populations, leading to incompatibility in their genomes and postzygotic reproductive isolation. If postzygotic isolating mechanisms have evolved, any mating between individuals from the different populations will produce hybrid offspring that are inviable or sterile. Individuals that mate only with members of their own population will therefore have higher fitness than individuals that mate with members of the other population, so natural selection will increase the frequency of any trait that prevents interbreeding between members of the two populations. Over time, prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms will evolve. In short, if some postzygotic reproductive isolation exists, natural selection will favor the evolution of prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms to prevent wasted reproductive effort by individuals mating with members of the other population. This process of postzygotic reproductive isolation leading to the evolution of prezygotic isolating mechanisms is termed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_hqZAxuIf5x">reinforcement</i>. Mathematical models of evolution support the idea that reinforcement can increase reproductive isolation. Although reinforcement is difficult to prove in natural populations, some field studies have provided evidence that reinforcement does occur in nature.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JIsraN2ZCk">A number of variations in this general model of allopatric speciation are possible. Many new species probably arise when a small group of individuals becomes geographically isolated from the main population; for example, a few individuals of a mainland population might migrate to a geographically isolated island. In this situation, founder effect and genetic drift play a larger role in the evolution of genetic differences between the populations.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_3Mpw0FQUGh">An excellent example of allopatric speciation can be found in Darwin’s finches, a group of birds that Charles Darwin observed on the Galápagos Islands during his voyage aboard the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_pDhBxdcYev">Beagle</i>. The Galápagos Islands form an archipelago located about 900 km off the coast of South America (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_3CtxnbGFa2" id="ben_9781319297145_GSrFxGoSAd"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_SetLAng9EG">Figure 26.6</strong></a>). Consisting of more than a dozen large islands and many smaller <span aria-label="806" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page806" role="doc-pagebreak" title="806"/>ones, the Galápagos formed from volcanoes that erupted over a geological hot spot that has remained stationary while the geological plate over it moved eastward during the past 3 million years. The movement of the plate pulled newly formed islands eastward, so the islands to the east (San Cristóbal and Española) are older than those to the west (Isabela and Fernandina). Over time, the number of islands in the archipelago increased as new volcanoes arose.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YlCqGjnlT0">Darwin’s finches consist of at least 14 species that are found on various islands in the Galápagos archipelago, and an additional species from Cocos Island, which is some 780 km to the north of the Galápagos (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1vbkp0191v" id="ben_9781319297145_d8lPfKVkyT"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_RxU3YLK6BK">Figure 26.7</strong></a>). The birds vary in the shapes and sizes of their beaks, which are adapted for eating different types of food. Studies of the development of finch embryos have helped to reveal some of the molecular details of how differences in beak shapes have evolved (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_IEQdhmRhe2" id="ben_9781319297145_xDU77UQAyN">Section 22.5</a>). Genetic studies have demonstrated that all the finches are closely related and that they evolved from a single ancestral species that migrated to the islands from the coast of South America some 2 million to 3 million years ago. The evolutionary relationships among the 14 Galápagos species, based on studies of DNA microsatellite data, are depicted in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1vbkp0191v" id="ben_9781319297145_TDyazkse5p">Figure 26.7</a>.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tboHfLal0c">The first finches to arrive in the Galápagos probably colonized one of the larger eastern islands. A breeding population became established and increased over time. At some point, a few birds dispersed to another island, where they were effectively isolated from the original population, and established a new population. The new population underwent genetic differentiation owing to genetic drift and adaptation to the local conditions of the island, and it eventually became reproductively isolated from the original population. Individual birds from the new population then dispersed to other islands and gave rise to additional species. This process was repeated many times. Occasionally, newly evolved species dispersed to an island where another species was already present, giving rise to secondary contact between the species. Today, many of the islands have more than one resident finch species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mlYgQrHUji">Researchers have now sequenced the entire genomes of all 14 Galápagos species and the Cocos Island species, providing a rich data set with which to interpret the history of the group.

For example, the birds traditionally classified as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_20Sp77qZvQ">Geospiza difficilis</i> (the sharp-beaked ground finch), which are found on different islands, appear to comprise at least three different species. The researchers also found genetic evidence of extensive interbreeding between some species, which gave rise to species with a mix of ancestry.</p>

Six of these regions contained genes that had been previously associated with cranial or facial development in birds or mammals, including the calmodulin gene discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_IEQdhmRhe2" id="ben_9781319297145_7PG7P4qA1Y">Section 22.5</a>.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xJxRcAXDag">Sympatric speciation arises in the absence of any geographic barrier to gene flow; in this mode of speciation, reproductive isolating mechanisms evolve within a single interbreeding population. Sympatric speciation has long been a controversial topic within evolutionary biology. Ernst Mayr believed that sympatric speciation was impossible, and he demonstrated that many apparent cases of sympatric speciation could be explained by allopatric speciation. More recently, however, evidence has accumulated that sympatric speciation can arise, and has arisen, under special circumstances. The difficulty with sympatric speciation is that reproductive isolating mechanisms arise as a <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_90eABdlEy0">consequence</i> of genetic differentiation, which takes place only if gene flow between groups is interrupted. But without reproductive isolation (or some external barrier), how can gene flow be interrupted? How can genetic differentiation arise within a single group that is freely exchanging genes?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_L8kiOxBW5G">Most models of sympatric speciation assume that genetic differentiation is initiated by selection favoring different phenotypes taking place within a single population.

Because mating takes place on and near the fruits, flies that use apples are more likely to mate with other flies that use apples, leading to genetic isolation between flies using hawthorns and those using apples. Indeed, researchers found that some genetic differentiation has already taken place between the two host races. Flies lay their eggs on ripening fruit, so there has been strong selection on the flies to synchronize their reproduction with the period when the fruit of their host species is ripening. Apples ripen several weeks earlier than hawthorns. Correspondingly, the peak mating period of the apple host race is three weeks earlier than that of the hawthorn host race. This difference in the timing of reproduction between apple and hawthorn races has further reduced gene flow—to about 4%—between the two host races. Analyses of protein variation and DNA microsatellites have demonstrated that the apple and hawthorn races now differ significantly at a number of loci. These differences have evolved in the past 150 years, and evolution appears to be ongoing.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_T2hQVTe6I1">As we have seen, genetic differentiation leads to the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms, which restrict gene flow between populations and lead to speciation. How much genetic differentiation is required for reproductive isolation to take place? This question has received considerable study by evolutionary geneticists, but unfortunately, there is no universal answer. Some newly formed species differ in many genes, whereas others appear to have undergone divergence in just a few genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tL3O408WRz">One group of organisms that has been extensively studied for genetic differences associated with speciation is the genus <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_yrEewICxtJ">Drosophila</i>.

The loci examined were used to estimate the overall degree of genetic differentiation and were not assumed to be directly involved in reproductive isolation. For each group, they computed a measure of genetic similarity, which ranges from 1 to 0 and represents the overall level of genetic differentiation (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_zzCna7gFiS"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2wOa8EMBy7" id="ben_9781319297145_b5hqe1XDUN">Table 26.2</a></strong>). They found that there was a general decrease in genetic similarity as flies evolve from geographic populations to subspecies to sibling species to nonsibling species. These data suggest that considerable genetic differentiation at many loci is required for speciation to arise. A study of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RgdzqzTqPZ">D. simulans</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_F68jAypRDY">D. melanogaster</i>, two species that produce inviable hybrids when crossed, suggested that at least 200 genes contribute to the inviability of hybrids between the two species.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BtcsqBaH1P">However, other studies suggest that speciation can arise through changes in just a few genes. For example, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_P3XpklWLvU">D. heteroneura</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fYXJYfCnTZ">D. silvestris</i> are two species of Hawaiian fruit flies that exhibit behavioral reproductive isolation. The isolation is determined largely by differences in head shape: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7XZ9TnkjsG">D. heteroneura</i> has a hammer-shaped head with widely separated eyes that is recognized by females of the same species but rejected by <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3DUCoTI3cd">D. silvestris</i> females. Genetic studies indicate that only a few loci (about 10) determine the differences in head shape.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_T0egsd534K">In another study, researchers examined genetic differences between two closely related species of birds, the collared flycatcher (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ynnBisDo5w">Ficedula albicollis</i>) and the pied flycatcher (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BcTprcEVVE">F. hypoleuca</i>), both of which occur in Europe. These two species are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor less than 2 million years ago, probably by allopatric speciation associated with glaciation. In areas where both species occur together, collared flycatchers and pied flycatchers sometimes mate, but the two species are separated by both pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms. For example, females prefer males with the plumage and song of their own species, and hybrids do not survive as well as offspring of parents that are both from the same species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_68LgFGijgg">Researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden completely sequenced the genomes of 10 male birds of each species. They found that large parts of the genomes of the two species were the same: for example, only about 5 out of 1000 nucleotides differed between species, compared with 4 out of 1000 nucleotides within species. The differences that did exist between the species were not uniform across the genome; rather, the differences tended to be concentrated in a few “divergence islands,” which had sequence differences up to 50 times greater than the average for the genome. A few divergence islands were found on each chromosome, and they occurred primarily near centromeres and telomeres, suggesting that differences in chromosome structure play an important role in speciation. The divergence islands tended to show few differences within species, indicating that natural selection had favored different genes in each region.</p>
