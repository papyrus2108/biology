Like other siblings, dizygotic twins may be of the same sex or of different sexes. The only difference between dizygotic twins and other siblings is that dizygotic twins are the same age and shared the same uterine environment. Dizygotic twinning often runs in families, and the tendency to produce dizygotic twins is influenced by both heredity and environmental factors. There appears to be little genetic tendency for producing monozygotic twins. The frequency of dizygotic twinning in the United States has doubled since 1980, largely because of fertility treatments, which often stimulate women to ovulate multiple eggs.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_fj8krNeE1D">Comparisons of dizygotic and monozygotic twin pairs can be used to assess the importance of genetic and environmental factors in producing differences in a characteristic. Such assessments are often made by calculating the concordance for a trait. If both members of a twin pair have a trait, the twins are said to be <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Eh7EbFNqJm">concordant</i>; if only one member of the pair has the trait, the twins are said to be <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_T8HuMMlfFM">discordant</i>.

Because identical twins share 100% of their genes and dizygotic twins share, on average, only 50%, genetically influenced traits should exhibit higher concordance in monozygotic twins. For instance, when one member of a monozygotic twin pair has epilepsy (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_TaC3ZHbe8e"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8omotxGaUq" id="ben_9781319297145_2yyP5vdoG3">Table 6.2</a></strong>), the other twin of the pair has epilepsy about 59% of the time; thus, the monozygotic concordance for epilepsy is 59%. When a dizygotic twin has epilepsy, however, the other twin has epilepsy only 19% of the time (19% dizygotic concordance). The higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests that genes influence epilepsy, a finding supported by the results of other family studies of this disease. In contrast, the concordance of death from acute infection is similar in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, suggesting that variation in death from infection has little inherited tendency. Concordances for several additional human traits and diseases are listed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8omotxGaUq" id="ben_9781319297145_4Ayf6aBBW7">Table 6.2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NIeOjiYcqN">The use of twins in genetic research rests on the important assumption that when concordance for monozygotic twins is greater than that for dizygotic twins, it is because monozygotic twins are more similar in their genes and not because they have experienced a more similar environment. The degree of environmental similarity between monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins is assumed to be the same. This assumption may not always be correct, particularly for human behaviors. Because they look alike, identical twins may be treated more similarly by parents, teachers, and peers than are nonidentical twins. Evidence of this similar treatment is seen in the past tendency of parents to dress identical twins alike. In spite of this potential complication, twin studies have played a pivotal role in the study of human genetics. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_lBWtISVK3J">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_aovTnkB61E" id="ben_9781319297145_14tcIDwMXM">PROBLEM 32</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_uMwmyLs0ry">To illustrate the use of twins in genetic research, let’s consider a study of asthma. Asthma is characterized by constriction of the airways and the secretion of mucus into the air passages, causing coughing, labored breathing, and wheezing (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_cHKnR6B7d3" id="ben_9781319297145_L7YnZTcRYd"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_GmnSgGO87R">Figure 6.12</strong></a>). Severe cases can be life threatening. Asthma is a major health problem in industrialized countries and appears to be on the rise. The incidence of childhood asthma varies widely around the globe; some of the highest rates (from 21% to 27%) are found in Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Brazil.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_HX1k6wOau6">A number of environmental stimuli are known to precipitate asthma attacks, including dust, pollen, air pollution, respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, and emotional stress. Allergies frequently accompany asthma, suggesting that asthma is a disorder of the immune system, but the precise relation between immune function and asthma is poorly understood. Numerous studies have shown that genetic factors are important in asthma.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_icD1fmFH04">A genetic study of childhood asthma was conducted as part of the Twins Early Development Study in England, an ongoing research project that studies more than 15,000 twin pairs born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996. <span aria-label="160" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" role="doc-pagebreak" title="160"/>These twins were assessed for language, cognitive development, behavioral problems, academic achievement, and other traits at various ages, and the genetic and environmental contributions to a number of their traits were examined. In the asthma study, researchers looked at a sample of 4910 twin pairs at age 4. Parents of the twins were asked whether either of their twins had been prescribed medication to control asthma; those children receiving asthma medication were considered to have asthma. The concordance for the monozygotic twins (65% among 1658 twin pairs) was significantly higher than that for the dizygotic twins (37% among 3252 twin pairs), and the researchers concluded that among the 4-year-olds included in the study, asthma was strongly influenced by genetic factors. The fact that even monozygotic twins were discordant 35% of the time indicates that environmental factors also play a role in asthma.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lSTwaO5IIb">Another technique used by geneticists to analyze human inheritance is the study of families involved in adoptions. This approach is one of the most powerful for distinguishing the effects of genes and environment on characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MlkarAst2o">For a variety of reasons, many children are separated from their biological parents soon after birth and adopted by adults with whom they have no genetic relationship. These adoptees share no more genes with their adoptive parents, on average, than any two randomly chosen individuals share; however, they do share an environment with their adoptive parents. In contrast, the adoptees share 50% of their genes with each of their biological parents, but do not share the same environment with them. If adoptees and their adoptive parents show similarities in a characteristic, these similarities can be attributed to environmental factors. If, on the other hand, adoptees and their biological parents show similarities, these similarities are probably due to genetic factors. Comparisons of adoptees with their adoptive parents and with their biological parents can therefore help define the roles of genetic and environmental factors in the determination of human variation. For example, adoption studies were instrumental in showing that schizophrenia has a genetic basis. Adoption studies have also shown that variation in obesity is at least partly influenced by genetics (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_G0VAQJP7Z9" id="ben_9781319297145_22U0K63ScQ"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Xcb9JwyuA2">Figure 6.13</strong></a>).</p>

The results include two line graphs: The first graph shows results for biological parents. The horizontal axis represents Adoptee weight class and has two markings from left to right: thin and obese. The vertical axis represents B M I of parents. The graph shows the following information: The line representing mother rises upwards steeply from a little above the thin marking and then its slope becomes almost plateauing as it approaches obese. The line representing father is above the line for mothers. It rises steeply upwards, then becomes a more shallow but consistent incline. A caption referring to both lines reads, “Overweight biological parents tend to have overweight children.”</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_90fRNKM66b">The second graph shows results for adoptive parents. The horizontal and vertical axis represents the same parameters. The graph shows the following information: The line representing mother rises upwards from high above the thin marking, plateaus between the markings, then declines to reach the same level as the start point above the obese marking. The line representing father is higher than the start point for mothers, rises a little upwards, then enters a steady decline as it approaches obese, but remains above the line representing mother. A caption referring to both lines reads, “There is no consistent association between the weight of children and that of their adoptive parents.” The conclusion states that genetic factors in uence body mass index.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZoKkH7GPk9">Adoption studies assume that the environments of biological and adoptive families are independent (i.e., not more alike than would be expected by chance). This assumption may not always be correct because adoption agencies carefully choose adoptive parents and may select a family that resembles the adoptee’s biological family. Thus, some of the similarity between adoptees and their biological parents may be due to these similar environments and not to shared genetic factors. In addition, adoptees and their biological mothers share the same environment during prenatal development. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_yuyA8oEnsd">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_cHh4JffZjD" id="ben_9781319297145_82o0PgxQPp">PROBLEM 35</a></strong></p>
