<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Md1LUrUz6e">RISCs that contain an siRNA (and some that contain an miRNA) pair with an mRNA molecule and cleave the mRNA near the middle of the bound siRNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_QwkNBE8hC8" id="ben_9781319297145_TS0CaBrKZ2">Figure 17.13a</a>). This cleavage is carried out by a protein that is sometimes referred to as Slicer. After cleavage, the mRNA is further degraded.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ECEvUu4p9o">Some miRNAs regulate genes by inhibiting the translation of complementary mRNAs (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_QwkNBE8hC8" id="ben_9781319297145_R63Tk6x7Up">Figure 17.13b</a>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Tc7iiReVMS">The exact mechanism by which miRNAs repress translation is still poorly understood, but some research suggests that they can inhibit the initiation step of translation as well as steps after initiation, such as ribosome stalling or premature termination. Many mRNAs have multiple miRNA-binding sites, and translation is most efficiently inhibited when multiple miRNAs are bound to the mRNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_7r5mk05DLP">A final mechanism by which miRNAs regulate gene expression is by triggering the decay of mRNA through a process that does not require Slicer activity. This mechanism plays a role in the degradation of short-lived mRNAs that contain an AU-rich element in their 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_rKXm0ca81d">′</sup> UTR. AU-rich elements are found, for example, in mRNAs that encode cytokines, proteins that play an important role in the body’s response to infection and injury. Overproduction of cytokines, or their production at the wrong time, can lead to shock and autoimmune disease, so precise regulation of cytokine synthesis is critical. Researchers have identified an miRNA with a sequence that is complementary to the AU-rich element. This miRNA binds to the AU-rich element and, in a way that is not yet fully understood, brings about the degradation of the mRNA in a process that requires Dicer and RISC. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_vW2bo2NuI7">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_09.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KwzUxfDgBN" id="ben_9781319297145_Bbx6LMRbgn">PROBLEM 27</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_VzreDx5eBT">Much of development in multicellular eukaryotes is controlled through gene regulation: different genes are turned on and off at specific times (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_aq2batjj9S" id="ben_9781319297145_50HvCZUv6z">Chapter 22</a>). In fact, when miRNAs were first discovered, researchers noticed that a <span aria-label="516" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page516" role="doc-pagebreak" title="516"/>mutation in an miRNA in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nWdYayCMaT">C. elegans</i> caused a developmental defect. Research has demonstrated that miRNA molecules are key factors in controlling development in animals, including humans, and plants. For example, the vertebrate heart develops through the programmed differentiation and proliferation of cardiac muscle cells, which are controlled by a specific miRNA termed miR-1-1.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RFL8r6kcyC">Through their effects on gene expression, miRNAs play important roles in many diseases and disorders. For example, a genetic form of hearing loss has been associated with a mutation in the gene that encodes an miRNA. Other miRNAs are associated with heart disease. One miRNA, called miR-1-2, is highly expressed in heart muscle. Mice genetically engineered to express only 50% of the normal amount of miR-1-2 frequently have holes in the wall that separates the left and right ventricles, a common congenital heart defect seen in newborn humans. Overexpression of another miRNA, called miR-1, in the hearts of adult mice <span aria-label="517" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page517" role="doc-pagebreak" title="517"/>causes cardiac arrhythmia—irregular electrical activity of the heart that can be life-threatening in humans.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_fhx3UC3ybo">An additional layer of gene regulation—called RNA crosstalk—arises from interactions and competition among miRNAs, mRNAs, and other RNA molecules. These interactions occur because different RNA molecules often share binding sites for the same miRNA. If the miRNA is in limited supply, then the RNAs with shared miRNA binding sites compete with one another for the limited copies of the miRNA.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3CanXzk9Hs">The RNA molecules that compete for miRNAs include some noncoding RNAs.

Some lncRNAs have multiple binding sites for miRNAs that are shared with mRNAs. The lncRNAs serve as molecular decoys, attracting the miRNAs and tying them up so that they are not available to bind to mRNA. Some recently discovered circular RNAs (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_6wvFIOVrRY">Chapter 14</a>) also have multiple binding sites for miRNAs and similarly serve as decoys for miRNAs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5XsPcsjQVC">The same type of competition can occur among RNA molecules that share binding sites for proteins that function in RNA splicing, stability, and translation. RNA molecules that engage in this type of crosstalk are collectively referred to as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Numerous examples of ceRNAs have been discovered, and RNA crosstalk may be an important component of gene regulation.</p>
