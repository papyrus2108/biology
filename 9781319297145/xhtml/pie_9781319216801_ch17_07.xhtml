<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_35ncZb8m2t">Ribosomes, charged tRNAs, initiation factors, and elongation factors are all required for the translation of mRNA molecules (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fX20GwRzso" id="ben_9781319297145_qMA7mtVSSy">Chapter 15</a>). The availability of these components affects the rate of translation and therefore influences gene expression. For example, the activation of T lymphocytes (T cells) is critical to the development of immune responses to viruses (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_UQI8JJKXAj">Chapter 22</a>). T cells are normally in the G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_vVOXJHCfpf">0</sub> stage of the cell cycle and not actively dividing. Upon exposure to viral antigens, however, specific T cells become activated and undergo rapid proliferation (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_0Klix4xcYf" id="ben_9781319297145_6qdQ48R7Ho"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_qwmumMWP3Q">Figure 17.14</strong></a>). Activation begins with a 7- to 10-fold increase in protein synthesis that causes the cells to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. This global burst of protein synthesis does not require an increase in mRNA synthesis. Instead, it is due to the increased availability of initiation factors, which allow ribosomes to bind to mRNA and begin translation. This increase in initiation factors leads to more translation of the existing mRNA molecules, increasing the overall amount of protein synthesized. In a similar way, insulin stimulates protein synthesis by increasing the availability of initiation factors. Initiation factors exist in inactive forms and, in response to various cell signals, can be activated by chemical modifications of their structure, such as phosphorylation.</p>

The T cell is exposed to a virus. Text reads, exposure to antigen. The virus is present at the top of T cell. A caption reads, Exposure to an antigen, such as a virus. Few initiation factors are present below. T cell with virus leads to increase in availability of these initiation factors. A large number of initiation factors are obtained on the right. Three dissociated ribosomal units are shown below along with three m R N A’s. The availability of large number of initiation factors causes the ribosomal units to bind the m R N A’s. Each m R N A has a ribosome attached to it. A chain of protein is emerging from the ribosomes. Initiation factors are also attached to these ribosomes. A caption reads, which allows ribosomes to bind to m R N A and carry out translation. This leads to increase in protein synthesis. A caption reads, Protein synthesis increases 7- to 10-fold. This further leads to an activated T cell. Finally, T cell undergoes proliferation. Four cells are obtained below. A caption reads, which causes the T cell to undergo proliferation.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_60sTWPaTK1">In addition to increasing overall protein synthesis, translational control can also target the synthesis of specific proteins. For example, research has demonstrated that eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which functions generally to initiate eukaryotic translation, can also bind to secondary structures in the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_Z5GUExeg7r">′</sup> untranslated regions of specific mRNAs and either stimulate or repress their translation, depending on the particular sequence to which it binds. The initiation of translation in some mRNAs is regulated by proteins that bind to the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_gakUuswIsM">′</sup> UTR of certain mRNAs and inhibit the binding of ribosomes, in a manner similar to the binding of repressor proteins to operators that prevents the transcription of structural genes in prokaryotes.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gaWYqcNXz5">Many eukaryotic proteins are extensively modified after translation by the selective cleavage and trimming of amino acids from the ends; by acetylation; or by the addition of phosphate groups, carboxyl groups, methyl groups, carbohydrates, or ubiquitin (a small protein) (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fX20GwRzso" id="ben_9781319297145_FsvWMbTcTd">Chapter 15</a>). Control of these modifications, which affect the transport, function, stability, and activity of the proteins, may also play a role in gene expression.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_HxRanT8ZLg">Now that we have considered the major types of gene regulation in bacteria (in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch16_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNK2N04MLy" id="ben_9781319297145_Fe4vR84mFI">Chapter 16</a>) and eukaryotes (in this chapter), let’s consider some of the similarities and differences in bacterial and eukaryotic gene control.</p>
<ol class="numbered-list" id="ben_9781319297145_j65oxfV1hB">
<li id="ben_9781319297145_XBIxu8cWi1">Much of gene regulation in bacterial cells is at the level of transcription (although it does exist at other levels). Gene regulation in eukaryotic cells takes place at multiple levels, including chromatin structure, transcription, mRNA processing, translation, RNA stability, and posttranslational modification of proteins.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_VkTd7z8fLR">Complex biochemical and developmental events in bacterial and eukaryotic cells may require a cascade of gene regulation, in which the activation of one set of genes stimulates the activation of another set.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_UxbTMa12dI">Much of gene regulation in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells is accomplished through proteins that bind to specific sequences in DNA. Regulatory proteins come in a variety of types, but most can be characterized according to a small set of DNA-binding motifs.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_yGhJSD66Ai">Chromatin structure plays a role in eukaryotic (but not bacterial) gene regulation. In general, condensed chromatin represses gene expression; chromatin structure must therefore be altered before transcription can take place. Chromatin structure is altered by chromatin-remodeling complexes, modification of histone proteins, and DNA methylation.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_vIEemzMsQy">Modifications to chromatin structure in eukaryotes may lead to epigenetic changes, which are changes that affect gene expression and are passed on to other cells or future generations.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_GfP0h00okT"><span aria-label="519" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page519" role="doc-pagebreak" title="519"/>In bacterial cells, many genes are clustered in operons and are coordinately expressed by transcription into a single mRNA molecule. In contrast, many eukaryotic genes have their own promoters. Coordinated gene regulation in eukaryotic cells often takes place through common response elements located in the promoters and enhancers of genes. Different genes that share the same response element are influenced by the same regulatory protein.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_GJj92PCKU4">Regulator proteins that affect transcription exhibit two basic types of control: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3Ce2VMsw7N">repressors</i> inhibit transcription (negative control) and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Y9MeBSqR1s">activators</i> stimulate transcription (positive control). Both negative control and positive control are found in bacterial and eukaryotic cells.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_chlgcmY4M7">The initiation of transcription is a relatively simple process in bacterial cells, and regulator proteins function by blocking or stimulating the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. In contrast, eukaryotic transcription requires complex machinery that includes RNA polymerase, general transcription factors, and other transcription factors, allowing transcription to be influenced by multiple factors.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_wB8m4EBnE4">Some eukaryotic transcription factors function at a distance from the gene by binding to enhancers, causing the formation of a loop in the DNA, which brings the promoter and enhancer into close proximity. Some sequences analogous to enhancers that act on distant genes have been described in bacterial cells, but they appear to be less common.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_74R7v7xE8J">The greater time lag between transcription and translation in eukaryotic cells than in bacterial cells allows mRNA stability and mRNA processing to play larger roles in eukaryotic gene regulation.</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_Yki1rmQxq9">Complementary RNA molecules (antisense RNA) may act as regulators of gene expression in bacteria. Regulation by siRNAs and miRNAs, which is extensive in eukaryotes, is absent in bacterial cells.</li>
