<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_BLNl1Zx7un">In their 1953 paper describing DNA structure, Watson and Crick (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xua4LZ2D44" id="ben_9781319297145_DDFusgSIIm">Chapter 10</a>) originally proposed that the primary cause of spontaneous replication errors is tautomeric shifts, in which the positions of protons (hydrogen atoms) in the DNA bases change. Each of the four DNA bases exists in different chemical forms, called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_EFMj6QhJLs">tautomers</i> (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_YSFjQzSVhL"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Xw0wU4s02S" id="ben_9781319297145_19NmROJ7Un">Figure 18.10a</a></strong>). The two tautomeric forms of each base are in dynamic equilibrium, although one form is much more common than the other. The standard Watson-and-Crick base pairings—adenine with thymine, and cytosine with guanine—occur between the common forms of the bases, but if the bases are in their rare tautomeric forms, other base pairings are possible (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_YgUEBvz4OK"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Xw0wU4s02S" id="ben_9781319297145_inWCYlxWet">Figure 18.10b</a></strong>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TZTdchK73R">Although Watson and Crick proposed that tautomeric shifts might produce mutations, tautomeric forms of the bases were difficult to detect in DNA, and evidence of their role in mutation was lacking. Many researchers assumed that other structures, such as protonated bases (see the following discussion), were responsible for base mispairing during replication. Recently, however, researchers have detected base mispairings in DNA that involve rare base tautomers.</p>

After another round of replication, the adenine will pair with thymine, creating a T • A pair in place of the original C • G pair (C • G → U • A → T • A); this chemical change is a transition mutation. This type of mutation is usually prevented by enzymes that remove uracil whenever it is found in DNA. The ability of these enzymes to recognize the product of cytosine deamination may explain why thymine, not uracil, is found in DNA. In mammals, including humans, some cytosine bases in DNA are naturally methylated and exist in the form of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_A01ho8cxQd" id="ben_9781319297145_IjrWJNMZYo">Figure 10.20</a>).

The experimental conditions were crude: they heated liquid mustard gas over a Bunsen burner on the roof of the pharmacology building and exposed the flies to the gas in a large chamber. After developing serious burns on her hands from the gas, Auerbach let others carry out the exposures, and she analyzed the flies. Auerbach and Robson showed that mustard gas is indeed a powerful mutagen, reducing the viability of gametes and increasing the numbers of mutations seen in the offspring of exposed flies. Because the research was part of a secret project during World War II, publication of their findings was delayed until 1947.</p>

The two pentose sugars have thymine bases (T) on the C 1 and a phosphate molecule is present between C 4 of both the sugars. A forward arrow labeled covalent bonds is present. When the sugar phosphate backbone is exposed to U V light, two covalent bonds are also formed between the thymine bases. The covalent bonds are shown by thick red vertical lines between two corresponding carbon atoms of the thymine bases. C 2 of first thymine base is covalently bonded to C 2 of the second thymine base. C 3 of the first thymine base is covalently bonded to C 3 of second thymine base.</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5zaqeZAZsh">Part b on the right shows a thymine dimer. The first thymine molecule has the following sequence from top to bottom: T, C, C, A, A, C, G, T, A, G. The second thymine molecule has the corresponding sequence: A, G, G, T double bonded to T, G, C, A, T, C. The double bond is represented by red, vertical parallel lines.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Cni2bvLVZV">When pyrimidine dimers block replication, cell division is inhibited and the cell usually dies; for this reason, UV light kills bacteria and is an effective sterilizing agent. For a mutation—a hereditary error in the genetic instructions—to occur, the replication block must be overcome. Bacteria can sometimes circumvent replication blocks produced by pyrimidine dimers and other types of DNA damage by means of the

This system can overcome these blocks and allow replication to proceed, but in the process, it makes numerous mistakes and greatly increases the rate of mutation. Indeed, the very reason that replication can proceed in the presence of a block is that the enzymes in the SOS system do not strictly adhere to the base-pairing rules. The trade-off is that replication continues and the cell survives, but only by sacrificing the normal accuracy of DNA synthesis.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_t2oqm8CoA5">Ionizing radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays damages DNA by dislodging electrons from atoms; these electrons then break phosphodiester bonds and alter the structure of bases. Ultraviolet light causes mutations primarily by producing pyrimidine dimers that disrupt replication and transcription. The SOS system enables bacteria to overcome replication blocks but introduces mistakes in replication.</p>
