<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2ViTwRIAnf">Transcription in eukaryotes is similar to bacterial transcription in that it includes initiation, elongation, and termination, and the basic principles of transcription already outlined apply to eukaryotic transcription. However, there are some important differences between bacterial and eukaryotic transcription. Eukaryotic cells possess three different RNA polymerases, each of which transcribes a different class of RNA and recognizes a different type of promoter. Thus, a generic promoter cannot be described for eukaryotic cells; rather, a promoter’s description depends on whether the promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase I, II, or III. Another difference is in the nature of promoter recognition and initiation. Many accessory proteins take part in the binding of eukaryotic RNA polymerases to DNA templates, and the different types of promoters require different proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_oQZt7Dhlq0">Transcription requires that sequences on DNA be accessible to RNA polymerase and other proteins. In eukaryotic cells, however, DNA is complexed with histone proteins in highly compressed chromatin (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rqYt5m90Nt" id="ben_9781319297145_zY6HnhTMHO">Figure 11.4</a>). How can the proteins necessary for transcription gain access to eukaryotic DNA when it is complexed with histones?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VYMWhxOn0f">The answer to this question is that chromatin structure is modified before transcription so that the DNA is in a more open configuration and is more accessible to the transcription machinery. Several types of proteins have roles in chromatin modification, as noted in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_1UOgcYWIyI">Chapter 11</a>. Acetyltransferases, for example, add acetyl groups to amino acids at the ends of the histone proteins, which destabilize nucleosome structure and make the DNA more accessible. Other types of histone modification, such as the addition of methyl groups, can also affect chromatin packing. In addition, chromatin-remodeling proteins may bind to the chromatin and displace nucleosomes from promoters and other regions important for transcription. We will take a closer look at the changes in chromatin structure associated with gene expression in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_AKsX19c1l3">Chapter 17</a>.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vy1QUdSrKv">After the RNA polymerase and general transcription factors have assembled on the core promoter, conformational changes take place in both the DNA and the polymerase. These changes cause 11 to 15 bp of DNA surrounding the transcription start site to unwind, producing the single-stranded DNA that will serve as a template for transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3XpAPkE0CI">The DNA template strand is positioned within the active site of the RNA polymerase, creating a structure called the open complex. After the open complex has formed, the synthesis of RNA begins as phosphate groups are cleaved off rNTPs and nucleotides are joined together to form an RNA molecule. As in bacterial transcription, the RNA polymerase may generate and release several short RNA molecules in abortive initiation attempts before it initiates the synthesis of a full-length RNA molecule. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_TeKHhbBHbj">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_BmNvqeabrI" id="ben_9781319297145_oa7aWW5LZX">PROBLEM 35</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_th0Jpq8PGa">After about 30 bp of RNA have been synthesized, the RNA polymerase moves downstream of the promoter and begins the elongation stage of transcription. Many of the general transcription factors are left behind at the promoter, where they can serve to quickly reinitiate transcription with another RNA polymerase enzyme.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gwsQfCyQrI">The molecular structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II and how it functions during elongation were revealed through the work of Roger Kornberg and his colleagues, for which Kornberg was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2006. The RNA polymerase maintains a transcription bubble during elongation, in which about eight nucleotides of the growing RNA molecule remain paired with the DNA template strand. The DNA double helix enters a cleft in the polymerase and is gripped by jawlike extensions of the enzyme (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sBGSMabnff" id="ben_9781319297145_0mtSoGx7In"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_YGUFazpF6r">Figure 13.18</strong></a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_na7jyo50HS">The three eukaryotic RNA polymerases use different mechanisms for termination. RNA polymerase I requires a termination factor similar to the rho factor used in terminating the transcription of some bacterial genes. Unlike rho, which binds to the newly transcribed RNA molecule, the termination factor for RNA polymerase I binds to a DNA sequence downstream of the terminator.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ETYn92NpKV">RNA polymerase III ends transcription after transcribing a terminator sequence that produces a string of uracil nucleotides in the RNA molecule. Recent research demonstrates that secondary structures, such as hairpins and stems, often occur upstream of the string of uracils and are necessary for termination. Thus, RNA polymerase III uses a termination mechanism similar to rho-independent termination in bacteria.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kqwZqvJSsK">The termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II does not occur at specific sequences. Instead, RNA polymerase II often continues to synthesize RNA hundreds or even thousands of nucleotides past the coding sequence necessary to produce the mRNA.
