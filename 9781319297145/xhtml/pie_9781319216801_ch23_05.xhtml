<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_nJIZQkS04u">Most cancers arise from mutations in several genes, often a combination of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Colorectal cancer is an excellent example of how the accumulation of successive genetic defects can lead to cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_St5u8MLVni">Colorectal cancer arises in the cells lining the colon and rectum. Almost 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, where this cancer is responsible for more than 51,000 deaths annually. If detected early, colorectal cancer can be treated successfully; consequently, there has been much interest in identifying the molecular events responsible for the initial stages of this cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_S5QWMkecRy">Colorectal cancer is thought to originate as benign tumors called adenomatous polyps (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_fo1ImnTrvM"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YbEpLSsmM5" id="ben_9781319297145_LeHQDMze6B">Figure 23.10</a></strong>). Initially, these polyps are microscopic, but in time they enlarge, and their cells acquire the abnormal characteristics of cancer cells. In the later stages of the disease, the tumor may invade the muscle layer surrounding the gut and metastasize. The progression of the disease is slow: it may take 10 to 35 years for a benign tumor to develop into a malignant tumor.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jq1eqVfB5B">A flowchart is shown with pictures. A section through normal colon is shown. Normal cells from the colon lead to loss of normal tumorsuppressor gene A P C. A picture shows a lump on the inside wall of the colon. A magnified image is then shown. The image has several cells and at the center is a lump with abnormally shaped cells. A blood vessel is shown below with spherical and bean-shaped cells. Two captions are as follows: “A polyp (small growth) forms on the colon wall.” and “A benign, precancerous tumor grows.” It leads to activation of oncogene ras, which further leads to loss of tumorsuppressor gene p 53. A caption reads, “An adenoma (benign tumor) grows.” The picture shows an even larger lump, which grows even more in the next picture spreading to the normal cells below. Another caption reads, “A carcinoma (malignant tumor) develops.” It then leads to other changes; loss of antimetastasis gene. A picture shows cancer cells breaking the normal cells and entering the blood vessel below. A caption reads, “The cancer metastasizes (spreads to other tissue through the bloodstream).”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ImxjQJ3UH5">Most cases of colorectal cancer are sporadic, developing in people with no family history of the disease, but a few families display a clear genetic predisposition to it. In one form of hereditary colon cancer, known as familial adenomatous polyposis coli, hundreds or thousands of polyps develop in the colon and rectum; if these polyps are not removed, one or more almost invariably become malignant.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tRTY9BD1fz">Because polyps and tumors of the colon and rectum can be easily observed and removed with a colonoscope (a fiber-optic instrument used to view the interior of the rectum and colon), much is known about the progression of colorectal cancer, and some of the genes responsible for its clonal evolution have been identified. Mutations in these genes are responsible for the successive steps of colorectal-cancer progression. Among the earliest steps is a mutation that inactivates the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wcerptKrwn">APC</i> gene; this mutation increases the rate of cell division, leading to polyp formation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YbEpLSsmM5" id="ben_9781319297145_YJxQZHvkwa">Figure 23.10</a>). A person with familial adenomatous polyposis coli inherits one defective copy of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_dPk1R26DFo">APC</i> gene, and defects in this gene are associated with the numerous polyps that appear in those who have this disorder. Mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_SNW6E5HGtW">APC</i> are also found in polyps that develop in people who do not have familial adenomatous polyposis coli.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zcYUGjUCy1">Mutations of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GS5EWgsN9X">ras</i> oncogene usually occur later, in larger polyps consisting of cells that have acquired some genetic mutations. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the normal <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_WHlH5Kn0Mu">ras</i> proto-oncogene is a key player in a signal-transduction pathway that relays a signal from growth factors to the nucleus, where the signal stimulates cell division. When <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_AorabAr0U7">ras</i> is mutated, the protein it produces continually <span aria-label="722" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page722" role="doc-pagebreak" title="722"/>relays a stimulatory signal for cell division, even when growth factors are absent.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_I4EdhziRKY">Mutations in tumor-suppressor gene <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_dt66zsqQpw">p53</i> and other genes appear still later in tumor progression; these mutations are rare in polyps but common in malignant cells. Many colorectal cancers have mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wtqE1S1v3V">p53</i>. Because <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_p1tCPsCHZ6">p53</i> prevents the replication of cells with genetic damage and affects proper chromosome segregation, mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_16PnQGRVaj">p53</i> can allow a cell to rapidly acquire further gene and chromosome mutations, which then contribute to further proliferation and invasion of surrounding tissues.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_KabYbOdzMZ">Recent research also shows that inflammation plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer. For example, people with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. (Inflammatory bowel disease is chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, often accompanied by severe diarrhea, pain, fatigue, and weight loss.) Although the precise mechanism by which inflammation contributes to cancer is unknown, immune-system cells and the proteins they secrete (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ALEZZf21Yw" id="ben_9781319297145_7nnp8MA4RG">Section 22.6</a>) are likely to affect many of the steps in the progression of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_piqT4ZdCoU">The sequence of steps just outlined is not the only route to colorectal cancer, and the mutations need not occur in the order presented here. However, this sequence is a common pathway by which colon and rectal cells become cancerous.</p>
