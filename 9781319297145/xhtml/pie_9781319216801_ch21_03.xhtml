<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_OpIvktOicC">Epigenetics alters the expression of genes; these alterations are stable enough to be transmitted through mitosis (and sometimes meiosis) but can also be changed. Most evidence suggests that epigenetic effects are brought about by physical changes in chromatin structure.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RifdbIHsRG">Some DNA regions have many CpG dinucleotides and are referred to as CpG islands. In mammalian cells, CpG islands are often located in or near the promoters of genes. These CpG islands are usually not methylated when genes are being actively transcribed. However, methylation of CpG islands near a gene leads to the repression of transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PkNaydDQOT">Cells repress and activate genes by methylating and demethylating cytosine bases. Enzymes called DNA methyltransferases methylate DNA by adding methyl groups to cytosine bases to create 5-methylcytosine. Other enzymes, called demethylases, convert 5-methylcytosine back to cytosine (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hCZ8eGlZbe" id="ben_9781319297145_ZTb7XFzH6r">Section 17.2</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_U44jD1WVXT">A remarkable example of epigenetics is seen in honeybees. Queen bees and worker bees are both female, but the resemblance ends there. The queen is large and develops functional ovaries, whereas workers are small and sterile (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_v8Arh7CG7S"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hBdvnDjpQb" id="ben_9781319297145_xEj8MmeSJ0">Figure 21.4</a></strong>). The queen goes on a mating flight and then spends the rest of her life reproducing, whereas workers spend all their time collecting nectar and pollen, tending the queen, and raising her offspring. In spite of these differences in their anatomy, physiology, and behavior, queens and workers are genetically the same; both develop from ordinary eggs. <span aria-label="655" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page655" role="doc-pagebreak" title="655"/>How they differ is in diet: worker bees produce and feed a few female larvae a special substance called royal jelly, which causes these larvae to develop as queens. Other larvae are fed ordinary bee food, and they develop as workers. This simple difference in diet greatly affects gene expression, causing different genes to be activated in queens and in workers, and resulting in very different sets of phenotypic traits.</p>

The methyl group of 5-methylcytosine sits within the major groove of the DNA molecule, which is recognized by many DNA-binding proteins. The presence of the methyl group in the major groove inhibits the binding of transcription factors and other proteins required for transcription to occur. The 5-methylcytosine also attracts certain proteins that directly repress transcription. In addition, DNA methylation attracts histone deacetylase enzymes, which remove acetyl groups from the tails of histone proteins, altering chromatin structure in a way that represses transcription (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hCZ8eGlZbe" id="ben_9781319297145_5NoNZl6An9">Section 17.2</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_06kNkRRUDB">A number of techniques have been developed for examining levels of DNA methylation. One set of techniques relies on restriction endonucleases, enzymes that make double-stranded cuts in the DNA at specific base sequences (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Z30p0WEvXC" id="ben_9781319297145_UgifEutjfn">Section 19.2</a>). Some restriction enzymes are sensitive to methylation and will not cut a sequence that contains 5-methylcytosine, whereas other restriction enzymes are insensitive to methylation. By cutting DNA with enzymes that are sensitive to methylation and with enzymes that are not, and then analyzing the resulting fragments, overall patterns of methylation can be determined.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pJ9mYuqttV">A more precise and widely used technique for analyzing DNA methylation is bisulfite sequencing (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_0Y1idtmJX2" id="ben_9781319297145_Y1u8RbxciD"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ToVvDMBGYm">Figure 21.6</strong></a>). In this technique, genomic DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil. Uracil is then detected as thymine during sequencing. However, 5-methylcytosine is not chemically altered by treatment with bisulfite, and it is detected as cytosine during sequencing (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_jLg8awdh1c" id="ben_9781319297145_o8I6MQwypp">Section 19.5</a> for a discussion of DNA sequencing). By sequencing genomic DNA with and without bisulfite treatment, researchers are able to determine the locations of all copies of 5-methylcytosine in the DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_A19ieiK2yy">Epigenetic changes can also occur through modification of histone proteins. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is complexed to histone proteins in the form of nucleosomes, which are the basic repeating units of chromatin structure (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_8EjLCCvaOa">Chapter 11</a>). Modifications of histones include the addition of phosphates, methyl groups, acetyl groups, and ubiquitin. Many of these modifications take place in the positively charged tails of the histone proteins, which interact with the DNA and affect chromatin structure. These modifications <span aria-label="657" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page657" role="doc-pagebreak" title="657"/>can occur at different amino acids on different histones and can create more than 100 unique potential changes in the histones. Many of these modifications alter chromatin structure and affect the transcription of genes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_3KB7AKFQnp">Chapter 17</a>). They may also serve as binding sites for proteins, such as transcription factors that are required for transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_73sIh3DglO">The addition of acetyl groups to amino acids in the histone tails (histone acetylation) generally destabilizes chromatin structure, causing it to assume a more open configuration; this addition is associated with increased transcription (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_w5wEFXefvA" id="ben_9781319297145_jpsdiWSEuN">Figure 17.2</a>). The addition of methyl groups to histones (histone methylation) also alters chromatin structure, but the effect varies depending on the specific amino acid that is methylated; some types of histone methylation are associated with increased transcription, and other types are associated with decreased transcription. For example, the addition of three methyl groups to lysine 4 in the H3 histone (H3K4me3; K stands for lysine) is often found near transcriptionally active genes. Methylation of lysine 36 in the H3 histone (H3K36me3) is also associated with increased transcription. On the other hand, the addition of three methyl groups to lysine 9 in H3 (H3K9me3) or to lysine 20 in histone 4 (H4K20me3) is associated with the repression of transcription. Many additional histone modifications, as well as changes to DNA that do not involve the base sequence, have been shown to be associated with the level of transcription. These types of modifications have been called

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zOoAreRYpd">Histone modifications are added and removed by special proteins. The Polycomb group (PcG) is a large group of proteins that repress transcription by modifying histones. These modifications alter chromatin structure so that the DNA is not accessible to transcription factors, RNA polymerase, and other proteins required for transcription. For example, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) adds two or three methyl groups to lysine 27 of histone H3, creating the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark, which represses transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rBV9EG23nq">Many of the enzymes and proteins that produce epigenetic marks cannot bind to specific DNA sequences by themselves. Thus, they must be recruited to specific targets on the chromosome. Sequence-specific transcription factors, preexisting chromatin marks, and noncoding RNA molecules serve to recruit histone-modifying enzymes to specific sites.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DCyRboKjNd">Research indicates that single histone modifications, such as those mentioned here, do not individually determine the transcriptional activity of a gene. Rather, it is the combined presence of multiple epigenetic marks that determines the activity level. There is also considerable “crosstalk” between epigenetic marks: one histone mark may affect whether additional marks occur nearby and how they function. Crosstalk occurs because histone modifications attract enzymes and proteins that modify other histones.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Kh9VO5cA6g">Histone modifications not only affect transcription but can also influence other molecular processes, such as DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint signaling (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hxtrp45HVN" id="ben_9781319297145_8ALEdb8FET">pp. 713–715 in Chapter 23</a>). For example, ubiquitination of histone H2B is required for the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. This modification leads to other histone modifications, such as methylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me); these modifications alter chromatin structure and allow proteins that repair double-strand breaks to access the DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_QFftC1twqR">The process by which histone modifications are maintained across cell division is not as well understood as that of DNA methylation. There is no universal mechanism for maintaining histone modifications; different types of modifications are undoubtedly maintained by different mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PEc3NApzb3">Several models have been proposed to explain how histone modifications are faithfully transmitted to daughter cells. During the process of DNA replication, nucleosomes are disrupted, and the original histone proteins are distributed randomly between the two new DNA molecules. Newly synthesized histones are then added to complete the formation of new nucleosomes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_bPYjc8Rqbx" id="ben_9781319297145_K8k5qJmiU2">Section 12.4</a>). Some models assume that after replication, the epigenetic marks remain on the original histones, and that these marks recruit enzymes that make similar changes in the new histones. These enzymes are said to “read and write”: they recognize (read) the epigenetic modifications, bind to them, and then modify (write) nearby histones that are lacking the modification. For example, PRC2, which adds the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark to histones, preferentially targets histones in chromatin that already contains an H3K27me3 mark, ensuring that any new nucleosomes that are added after replication also become methylated. In this way, the histone modifications can be maintained across cell division. An alternative model, supported by experimental evidence in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GWtYmXsSKB">Drosophila</i> embryos, proposes that the epigenetic marks are lost during replication, but that the enzymes that bring about histone modifications remain attached to the original histones during replication and reestablish the marks on the original and new histones after replication is completed.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_H7paMfZhL1">Histone modifications can be detected by breaking the chromatin into fragments and applying an antibody specific to a particular histone modification in a process called chromatin immunoprecipitation (abbreviated ChIP; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hCZ8eGlZbe" id="ben_9781319297145_STpBPODj8F">Section 17.2</a>). The antibody mediates the precipitation of chromatin fragments with the histone modification, causing them to separate from chromatin fragments without the modification. The histones are then removed by digestion with an enzyme that degrades protein but not DNA. The genomic location of the precipitated DNA fragment with which the histone was associated is then determined. <span aria-label="658" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page658" role="doc-pagebreak" title="658"/>In a technique called ChIP-Seq, the fragments are sequenced and their genomic locations are determined by comparing the sequence with a reference genome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lUFKJ0vrcQ" id="ben_9781319297145_DhPRVFslr0">Figure 17.4</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_o8j9k3hSoV">Evidence increasingly demonstrates that RNA molecules play an important role in bringing about epigenetic effects. The first discovered and still best-understood example of RNA mediation of epigenetic change is X inactivation (mentioned in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_f2TMw9nQp4" id="ben_9781319297145_hepPW3AuJ2">Section 4.3</a>), in which a long noncoding RNA called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kY6GKhrszI">Xist</i> suppresses transcription on one of the X chromosomes in female mammals. Another example involves paramutation in corn, in which an epigenetically altered allele, by means of siRNAs, induces a change in another allele that then gets transmitted to future generations. Both of these examples will be discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_I5mTkEL6Jh" id="ben_9781319297145_d5PoKL9DLH">Section 21.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EeVvDjeO5u">Various mechanisms are involved in epigenetic changes produced by RNA molecules. In the case of X inactivation, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_erEwI0CdYC">Xist</i> RNA coats one X chromosome and then attracts PRC2, which deposits methyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3, creating the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark, which alters chromatin structure and represses transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_coSfhLZBEK">Other examples of RNA-associated epigenetic phenotypes are produced by siRNA molecules that silence genes and transposable elements (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_abW44qC3Lm" id="ben_9781319297145_uwjBXGCbC1">Section 18.4</a>) by directing DNA methylation or histone modifications to specific DNA sequences. In addition, research has demonstrated that epigenetic processes such as methylation and histone modification influence the expression of microRNAs (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TUZBFLs6AG" id="ben_9781319297145_CcXF4l1Sfk">Section 14.5</a>), which in turn play an important role in regulating other genes.
