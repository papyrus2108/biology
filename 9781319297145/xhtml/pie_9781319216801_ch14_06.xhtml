<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_sIq9Z2V8Ea">Much evidence suggests that the first genetic material was RNA and that early life was dominated by RNA molecules (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KBBmwjHUS4" id="ben_9781319297145_QmK3Ffezhh">Chapter 13</a>). This early period, when RNA dominated life’s essential processes, has been termed the “RNA world.” The common perception is that this RNA world died out billions of years ago, when many of RNA’s functions were taken over by more stable DNA molecules and more efficient protein catalysts. Within recent years, however, numerous small RNA molecules (most of them 20–30 nucleotides long) that greatly influence many basic biological processes have been discovered. These small RNA molecules play important roles in transcription, translation, chromatin modification, gene expression, development, cancer, and defense against foreign DNA. They are also being harnessed by researchers to study gene function and to treat genetic diseases. The discovery of small RNA molecules has greatly influenced our understanding of how genes are regulated and has demonstrated the importance of DNA sequences that do not encode proteins. These new findings demonstrate that we still live very much in an RNA world.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QHIjiAX9pC">In this section, we examine RNA interference (which led to the discovery of small RNAs), different types of small RNAs, and the processing of two of these types: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2pY84vmaI9">In 1998, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, and their colleagues observed a strange phenomenon. They were inhibiting the expression of genes in the nematode <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GhPblQcdNd">Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by injecting single-stranded RNA molecules that were complementary to a gene’s DNA sequence. Called antisense RNA, such molecules were known to inhibit gene expression by binding to mRNA sequences and inhibiting their translation. However, Fire, Mello, and colleagues found that even more potent gene silencing was triggered when double-stranded RNA was injected into the nematodes. This finding was puzzling, because no mechanism by which double-stranded RNA could inhibit translation was known. Several other, previously described types of gene silencing were also found to be triggered by double-stranded RNA. These initial studies led to the discovery of small RNA molecules that are important in gene silencing. For their discovery of RNA interference, Fire and Mello were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2006.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_w2XK0AGRsC">Subsequent research revealed an astonishing array of small RNA molecules with important cellular functions in eukaryotes, which now include at least three major classes: small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These small RNAs are found in many eukaryotes and are responsible for a variety of different functions, including the regulation of gene expression, defense against viruses, suppression of transposons, and modification of chromatin structure. An analogous group of small RNAs with silencing functions—called CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs)—have been detected in prokaryotes.</p>

Some miRNAs are cleaved from RNA molecules transcribed from sequences that encode miRNA only, but others are encoded in the introns and exons of mRNAs. Each miRNA is cleaved from a single-stranded RNA precursor that forms small hairpins, whereas multiple siRNAs are produced from the cleavage of an RNA duplex consisting of two different RNA molecules.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mlFpM6CTmb">Usually, siRNAs have exact complementarity with their target mRNA or DNA sequences, whereas miRNAs often have limited complementarity with their target mRNAs. Small interfering RNAs primarily suppress gene expression by degrading mRNA, while miRNAs often suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation. Finally, miRNAs usually silence genes that are distinct from those from which the miRNAs were transcribed, whereas siRNAs typically silence the genes from which the siRNAs were transcribed. Note, however, that these differences between siRNAs and miRNAs are not hard and fast, and scientists are increasingly finding small RNAs that exhibit characteristics of both. For example, some miRNAs (such as those in plants) have exact complementarity with mRNA sequences and cleave those sequences—characteristics that are usually associated with siRNAs.</p>

Key to the functioning of RISCs is a protein called Argonaute. The RISC pairs with an mRNA molecule that possesses a sequence complementary to its siRNA or miRNA component, and the RISC then either cleaves the mRNA, leading to its degradation, or represses translation of the mRNA. Some siRNAs also serve as guides for the methylation of complementary sequences in DNA, and others alter chromatin structure, both of which affect transcription.

Thus, miRNAs are often described like other RNA molecules. Most are named miR with a dash and a number, such as miR-33 or miR-140. MicroRNAs have been found in all eukaryotic organisms examined to date, as well as in viruses: they control the expression of genes taking part in many biological processes, including growth, development, and metabolism. Humans have more than 500 distinct miRNAs; scientists estimate that most human mRNAs are regulated by miRNAs.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ypzAlfprn1">Piwi-interacting RNAs combine with Piwi proteins, which are related to Argonaute, to suppress the expression and movement of transposons in the germ cells of animals. The term Piwi stands for “<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tl0t9KsNmW">P</i> Element <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_hkuoadfr8N">I</i>nduced <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jhl7TnmKMN">Wi</i>mpy testis,” which refers to infertility in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1Eq4hXcbKX">Drosophila</i> associated with mutations in genes that encode Piwi proteins. Although the mechanism of transposon silencing by piRNAs is not fully understood, we know that it includes the degradation of mRNA transcribed from transposons, changes in chromatin structure that inhibit the transcription of transposons, and inhibition of the translation of proteins encoded by transposons. Piwi-interacting RNAs are also expressed in somatic tissues, where their function is less well understood; evidence suggests that they play a role in transposon silencing, stem-cell maintenance, tissue regeneration, and epigenetic processes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ADgLPh7G4F">After the discovery of small RNAs in eukaryotes, similar small RNAs, called CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), were discovered in prokaryotes. CRISPR RNAs are encoded by DNA sequences found in bacterial and archaeal genomes termed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_sbkEM3lQm5">c</i>lustered <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XkCYzPB9j0">r</i>egularly <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_T3ENGwRIUA">i</i>nterspaced <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_etY3tlxwW1">s</i>hort <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_qeebpQBSLA">p</i>alindromic <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gxXDmZ77xQ">r</i>epeats. Palindromic sequences are sequences that read the same forward and backward on two complementary DNA strands (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EWKADqCEc2" id="ben_9781319297145_Mdvlq3V84N">Chapter 4</a>). A CRISPR array consists of a series of such palindromic sequences, separated by spacers that are derived from the DNA of foreign bacteriophage or plasmid genomes. For example, in the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RENSafo2Xp">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, CRISPR palindromic repeats are 28 bp in length, separated by 32 bp spacers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_uzwUUg6Uh3">CRISPR RNAs combine with Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins to provide defense against the invasion of specific foreign DNA molecules, such as DNA originating from bacteriophages and plasmids (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sMlss9GGrV" id="ben_9781319297145_O0zGPMitkW">Chapter 9</a>). Because they target specific DNA molecules, CRISPR-Cas systems have been compared to the immune systems of vertebrates. CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread in prokaryotes, occurring in 50% of bacterial species and 90% of archaea.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_u3nxibkE3G">The action of a CRISPR-Cas system takes place in three stages: acquisition, expression, and interference. In acquisition, which is still incompletely understood, foreign DNA from a bacteriophage or plasmid that enters the cell is identified, processed, and inserted into the CRISPR array as a new spacer between the palindromic repeats (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xvhBv1Lzbi" id="ben_9781319297145_aFJHVNgb1K"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_xBqBzqEGDX">Figure 14.23a</strong></a>). The spacer DNA then serves as a memory of this foreign DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_mJfrAoGjVt">Part a at the top shows acquisition where a phage D N A double strand is present. Pieces of phage D N A are inserted into a C R I S P R array below. A caption reads, fragments of phage D N A are inserted into the bacterial C R I S P R array. The phage D N A is inserted near the 5 prime end of a stretch of D N A that contains spacers and palindrome sequences. A caption reads, the array is transcribed into a pre-c r R N A. Transcription of C R I S P R array occurs below. Part b below shows expression. Transcription leads to pre c r R N A sequence. Cleavage by C a s protein occurs and a c r R N A containing phage R N A is produced below. A caption reads, which is cleaved, generating c r R N A’s. C A S protein enters the process and an effector complex with c r R N A is formed. A caption reads, c r R N A and a C a s protein combine to form an effector complex. The part c below shows interference. The effector complex bind to a foreign D N A and replication bubble is formed inside the effector complex. The c r R N A bonds to the upper strand of D N A and eventually, the D N A is cleaved into two fragments below. A caption reads, that binds to foreign D N A containing the sequence in the C R I S P R array and cleaves the foreign D N A.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_jWdISTSANS">In the second stage—expression—the CRISPR array is transcribed into a long CRISPR precursor RNA (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xvhBv1Lzbi" id="ben_9781319297145_LP5KEcgQ6y"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_FYnuD074AD">Figure 14.23b</strong></a>), which is then cleaved by Cas proteins and processed into crRNAs, each of which contains one spacer sequence that is homologous to the foreign DNA. The crRNA then combines with a Cas protein to form an effector complex.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kkmjS2lt0r">The final stage (interference) occurs when foreign DNA from the same bacteriophage or plasmid enters the cell again. The effector complex binds to the foreign DNA through base paring between the crRNA and the foreign DNA sequence. The Cas protein then cleaves the foreign DNA, rendering it nonfunctional (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xvhBv1Lzbi" id="ben_9781319297145_yZ8JC6d4mY"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_IpNWnV9jEs">Figure 14.23c</strong></a>). In this way, crRNAs serve as an adaptive RNA defense system against foreign invaders.</p>
