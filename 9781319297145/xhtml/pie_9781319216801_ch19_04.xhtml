<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_qXiOKhuI9C">Many of the methods used to manipulate and analyze DNA sequences cannot be carried out on single molecules, requiring instead numerous copies of a specific DNA fragment. A major problem in working at the molecular level is that each gene is a tiny fraction of the total cellular DNA. Because each gene is so rare, it must be isolated and amplified before it can be studied. There are two basic approaches to amplifying a specific DNA fragment: replicating the DNA within cells (in vivo), or replicating the DNA enzymatically outside of cells (in vitro).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QsDG6IPEnK">In the in vivo approach, a DNA fragment is inserted into a bacterial cell and the cell is allowed to replicate the DNA. Each time the cell divides, one or more copies of the DNA fragment are passed on to each daughter cell. Most bacterial cells divide rapidly, so within a short time (usually a few <span aria-label="580" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page580" role="doc-pagebreak" title="580"/>days), a large number of genetically identical cells are produced, each carrying one or more copies of the DNA fragment. The cells are then lysed to release their DNA, and the desired fragment is isolated from the rest of the bacterial DNA. This procedure is termed

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_asouZw2qVb">For many years, all amplification of DNA was done by gene cloning. A major disadvantage of gene cloning is the time required: the process of inserting the DNA into bacteria, selecting and growing the bacterial cells that have incorporated it, and isolating the amplified DNA usually takes several days. Gene cloning is also relatively labor-intensive, requiring a number of steps that are difficult to automate. An advantage is that, because it uses the cell’s high-fidelity replication machinery, gene cloning typically copies DNA with great accuracy.</p>

The basis of PCR is DNA replication catalyzed by a DNA polymerase. Because a DNA molecule consists of two nucleotide strands, each of which can serve as a template, the amount of DNA doubles with each replication event. PCR allows DNA fragments to be amplified a billionfold within just a few hours, and it can be used with extremely small amounts of original DNA, even a single molecule. The polymerase chain reaction revolutionized molecular biology and is now one of the most widely used molecular techniques.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gwyEr4OYBg">We first discuss PCR because it is the most widely used technique for amplifying DNA fragments today. We then return to gene cloning, which, in addition to its use in amplifying DNA, is often employed to manipulate gene sequences.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_hcpAmObQma">Replication by PCR requires a DNA template (the fragment of interest, or target DNA) from which a new DNA strand can be copied and a pair of single-stranded primers, each with a 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_K60vlEnKMp">′</sup>-OH group to which new nucleotides can be added. The primers used in PCR are short fragments of DNA, typically 17–25 nucleotides long, that are complementary to known sequences on the template. To carry out PCR, researchers begin with a solution that includes the target DNA, DNA polymerase, all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs—the substrates for DNA polymerase), primers, and magnesium ions and other salts that are necessary for the reaction to proceed.</p>

In step 1, a starting solution of DNA is heated to 90°–100°C to break the hydrogen bonds between the strands and thus produce the necessary single-stranded templates. The reaction mixture is held at this temperature for only a minute or two. In step 2, the DNA solution is cooled quickly to 30°–65°C and held at this temperature for a minute or less. During this short interval, the DNA strands do not have a chance to reanneal, but the primers are able to attach to the template strands. In step 3, the solution is heated for a minute or less to 72°C, the temperature at which <span aria-label="581" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page581" role="doc-pagebreak" title="581"/>DNA polymerase can synthesize new DNA strands. At the end of the cycle, two double-stranded DNA molecules are produced for each original molecule of DNA.</p>

The two strands separate and short primers are attached to their inner ends. A new D N A forms on both strands. The cycle repeats and produces eight D N A. Two D N A have one old D N A and one newly synthesized strand. The rest have both new strands. The captions in the illustration read, “first, D N A is heated to 90 to 100 degree Celsius to separate the two strands. Second, The D N A is quickly cooled to 30 to 65 degrees Celsius to allow short single-stranded primers to anneal to their complementary sequences. Third, the solution is heated to 72 degrees Celsius; D N A polymerase synthesizes new D N A strands, creating two new, double-stranded D N A molecules. Fourth, the entire cycle is repeated. Each time the cycle is repeated, the amount of target D N A doubles.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_b3pMhuN0uO">The second key innovation was the development of automated thermal cyclers: machines that bring about the rapid temperature changes necessary for the different steps of PCR.

In automated thermal cyclers, the reaction tubes are placed in a metal block whose temperature changes rapidly according to a computer program.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_b7BiyvonPs">Today, the polymerase chain reaction is often used in place of gene cloning, but it has several limitations. First, the use of PCR requires prior knowledge of at least part of the sequence of the target DNA so that the primers can be constructed. Second, the capacity of PCR to amplify extremely small amounts of DNA makes contamination a significant problem. Minute amounts of DNA from the skin of laboratory workers or small particles in the air can enter a reaction tube and be amplified along with the target DNA. A careful laboratory technique and the use of controls are necessary to circumvent this problem.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_S8a07XiIQK">A third limitation of PCR is accuracy. Unlike other DNA polymerases, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_NFtgXkeDq2">Taq</i> polymerase does not have the capacity to proofread (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_04.xhtml#page359" id="ben_9781319297145_2w1xDuP6b6">Chapter 12</a>), and under standard PCR conditions, it incorporates an incorrect nucleotide about once every 20,000 bp. Other heat-stable DNA polymerases with proofreading capacity have been isolated that give more accurate PCR results.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_B3ivfGXuXL">A fourth limitation of PCR is that the size of the fragments that can be amplified by standard <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1uND25eVVO">Taq</i> polymerase is usually less than 2000 bp. By using a combination of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_QkxnZVHdWd">Taq</i> polymerase and a DNA polymerase with proofreading capacity, and by modifying the reaction conditions, investigators have been successful in extending PCR amplification to larger fragments, but even these larger fragments are limited in length to 50,000 bp.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zk7kDQX3ti">In spite of its limitations, PCR has become one of the most widely used tools within molecular biology. Because the primers used in PCR are specific for known DNA sequences, PCR can be used to detect the presence of a particular DNA sequence in a sample. For example, PCR is often used to detect the presence of viruses in blood samples by adding primers complementary to known viral DNA sequences to the reaction mixture. If viral DNA is present, the primers will attach to it, and a DNA fragment of a known length will be amplified. The presence of a DNA fragment of that length on a gel indicates the presence of viral DNA in the blood sample. Modern diagnostic tests for infection with HIV, the causative agent of AIDS (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZG4JYZKkbH" id="ben_9781319297145_JfVFr6FSms">Section 9.5</a>), use this type of PCR amplification of HIV sequences.</p>

This has proven to be especially useful for aquatic and marine organisms. These animals are constantly shedding DNA into their aquatic or marine environment. Water from a river, a spring, or the ocean is collected and filtered for DNA. The eDNA is isolated, and primers specific to the genome of the organism of interest are used in a PCR reaction, which amplify that organism’s DNA when it is present. The presence of a PCR product (usually a band on a gel) provides evidence that the organism is present in the sampled environment. The identification can be verified by sequencing the PCR product and determining that the sequence belongs to the organism of interest.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LNJdiRbjWo">Another common application of PCR is to identify genetic variation in natural populations. PCR can be used to amplify specific segments of DNA, which are then analyzed with other molecular tools that identify differences in nucleotide sequences (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_s3h1t5cMB6" id="ben_9781319297145_QNzA3iNfoP">Chapter 26</a>). In addition, primers specific to a particular DNA variant can be used to determine whether that variant is present in the genome of an individual organism.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TJgCiWNWZn">PCR has also allowed the isolation of DNA from ancient sources, such as DNA from Neanderthals (discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Wj2rH5wY7r" id="ben_9781319297145_fteliARpyz">Section 1.1</a>). It is commonly used to amplify small samples of DNA from crime scenes and identify their sources through detection of microsatellite variation (see the discussion of <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KDbiacRKn6" id="ben_9781319297145_A38n3vQ4Sg">DNA fingerprinting in Section 19.5</a>).</p>

In this procedure, PCR is used to amplify a specific DNA fragment, and a sensitive instrument is used to accurately determine the amount of DNA that is present in solution after each PCR cycle. A fluorescent probe that is specific to the DNA sequence of interest is frequently used in the reaction, so that only the DNA of interest is measured. The technique is called real-time PCR because the amount of DNA amplified is measured as the reaction proceeds.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kMtazP3Et5">Often, real-time PCR is combined with reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to measure the amount of mRNA in a sample, allowing biologists to precisely determine the level of gene expression in different cells and under different conditions; this method is referred to as qRT-PCR. For example, researchers interested in how gene expression changes in response to the administration of a drug often use real-time PCR to measure the amount of mRNA produced by specific genes in cells exposed to the drug. They can then compare it with the amount of mRNA produced by the same genes in control cells with no drug exposure.</p>

A short fragment on each circle shows Ori (origin of replication) on the top left of the vector. A large arc on the circles on the bottom right is labeled selectable marker. In between ori and selectable marker, various unique restriction enzyme cleavage sites are present. Their sequence from left to right is as follow: P S T 1, Bam H 1, Sal 1, Eco R 1, and Hind 3. Captions in the vector map are as follows: “First, a cloning vector must contain an origin of replication recognized in the host cell so that it is replicated along with the D N A that it carries. Second, it should carry selectable markers—traits that enable cells containing the vector to be selected or identi¬fied. Third, a cloning vector needs a single cleavage site for each of one or more restriction enzymes used.”</p>

A large arc on the circles on center right is labeled selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance. On the bottom left, it shows a region with genes encoding repressor that binds O and regulates P. In between these genes and selectable marker, various sites are labeled. Their sequence from left to right is as follow: bacterial promoter sequences (P), operator (O), transcription initiation sequences, multiple restriction sites, and the transcription-termination sequence. Captions in the illustration read as follows: “Expression vectors contain operon sequences that allow inserted D N A to be transcribed and translated.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rENMf1KOwt">Although manipulating genes in bacteria is simple and efficient, the goal may be to transfer a gene into eukaryotic cells. For example, it might be desirable to transfer a gene conferring herbicide resistance into a crop plant, or to transfer a gene for clotting factor into a person with hemophilia. Many eukaryotic proteins are modified after translation (e.g., carbohydrate groups may be added). Such modifications are essential for proper function, but bacteria do not have the capacity to carry them out; thus, a functional protein can be produced only in a eukaryotic cell.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_qvtiIpho2r">An early and economically important use of the Ti cloning plasmid was the genetic engineering of plants that produce their own insecticides. The bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_QY0ebZmSRE">Bacillus thuringiensis</i> naturally produces a protein, known as the Bt toxin, that is lethal to many insects. The Bt toxin is particularly attractive as an insecticide because it is specific to particular insects, breaks down quickly in the environment, and is not toxic to humans and other animals. In 1987, Mark Vaeck and his colleagues at Plant Genetic Systems in Belgium genetically engineered tobacco plants to express the Bt toxin. Subsequently, other researchers introduced the gene for Bt toxin into cotton, tomatoes, corn, and other plants (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ng0NbeiLtg"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_akvOSuQdzC" id="ben_9781319297145_RNwhabeZv4">Figure 19.12</a></strong>).
