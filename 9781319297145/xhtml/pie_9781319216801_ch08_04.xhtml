<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_nWeChJZjbL">Aneuploidy can arise in several ways. First, a chromosome may be lost in the course of mitosis or meiosis if, for example, its centromere is deleted. Loss of the centromere prevents the spindle microtubules from attaching, so the chromosome fails to move to the spindle pole and does not become incorporated into a nucleus after cell division. Second, the small chromosome generated by a Robertsonian translocation may be lost in mitosis or meiosis. Third, <span aria-label="236" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" role="doc-pagebreak" title="236"/>aneuploidy may arise through nondisjunction, the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate in meiosis or mitosis (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EWKADqCEc2" id="ben_9781319297145_KyoZV77YoD">Chapter 4</a>). Nondisjunction leads to some gametes or cells that contain an extra chromosome and other gametes or cells that are missing a chromosome (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Yw4fMUEQ4B" id="ben_9781319297145_14xwiOl3Ow"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ypt8vUoyiY">Figure 8.19</strong></a>). <span class="underline" id="ben_9781319297145_XQ5EitQPAi"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_iWv47TZhU2"/></span></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_43GH5I0vTY">One of the first aneuploids to be recognized was a fruit fly with a single X chromosome and no Y chromosome, discovered by Calvin Bridges in 1913 (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_vwCdfCh3Hp" id="ben_9781319297145_hGur1WrMdN">Chapter 4</a>). Another early study of aneuploidy focused on mutants in the Jimson weed (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TPPo9S9S1I">Datura stramonium</i>). A. Francis Blakeslee began breeding this plant in 1913, and he observed that crosses with several Jimson-weed mutants produced unusual ratios of progeny. For example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_G4wXruOGhN">globe</i> mutation (which produces a globe-shaped seedcase) was dominant but was inherited primarily from the female parent. When <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_beq1REWNgI">globe</i> mutants self-fertilized, only 25% of the progeny had the globe phenotype. If the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_I6LvaOOS7N">globe</i> mutation were strictly dominant, Blakeslee should have seen 75% of the progeny with the trait (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_8H4LRNJ6A7">Chapter 3</a>), so the 25% that he observed was unusual. Blakeslee isolated 12 different mutants (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_p0lCRN5KKh" id="ben_9781319297145_Hl50bfYn64"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_vVcTAaTAmc">Figure 8.20</strong></a>) that exhibited peculiar patterns of inheritance. Eventually, John Belling demonstrated that these 12 mutants were in fact trisomics. <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fw83e3KfJE">D. stramonium</i> has 12 pairs of chromosomes (2<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vpNIAWBkUv">n</i> = 24), and each of the 12 mutants was trisomic for a different chromosome pair. The aneuploid nature of the mutants explained the unusual ratios that Blakeslee had observed in the progeny. Many of the extra chromosomes in the trisomics were lost in meiosis, so fewer than 50% of the gametes carried the extra chromosome, and the proportion of trisomics in the progeny was low. Furthermore, the pollen containing an extra chromosome was not as successful in fertilization, and trisomic zygotes were less viable.</p>

In most animals and many plants, aneuploidies are lethal. Because aneuploidy affects the number of gene copies but not their nucleotide sequences, the effects of aneuploidy are most likely due to abnormal gene dosage. Aneuploidy alters the dosage for some, but not all, genes, disrupting the relative concentrations of gene products and often interfering with normal development.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_SMNbn2KeCt">A major exception to the relation between gene number and gene dosage pertains to genes on the mammalian X chromosome. In mammals, X-chromosome inactivation ensures that males (who have a single X chromosome) and females (who have two X chromosomes) receive the same functional dosage for X-linked genes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_f2TMw9nQp4" id="ben_9781319297145_raAfKlnYD9">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion of X-chromosome inactivation). Because additional X chromosomes in mammals are inactivated, we might expect that aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes would be less detrimental in these animals. Indeed, this is the case for mice and humans, for whom aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes is the most common form of aneuploidy seen in living organisms. Y-chromosome aneuploidy is probably relatively common because there is so little information in the Y chromosome.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zYR2MiwONV">A high percentage of all human embryos that are conceived possess chromosome abnormalities. Findings from studies of women who are attempting pregnancy suggest that more than 30% of all conceptions are spontaneously aborted (miscarried), usually so early in development that the woman is not even aware of her pregnancy. Chromosome mutations are present in at least 50% of spontaneously aborted human fetuses, with aneuploidy accounting for most of them. This rate of chromosome abnormality in humans is higher than in other organisms that have been studied; in mice, for example, aneuploidy is found in no more than 2% of fertilized eggs. <span aria-label="238" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" role="doc-pagebreak" title="238"/>Most aneuploids in humans are due to missegregation of chromosomes in meiosis I during oogenesis, the formation of eggs in females.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_66fvuI0pCn">In <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_kdYN8ccb3i">Chapter 2</a>, we discussed the importance of crossovers for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I. Generally, each pair of homologous chromosomes must undergo at least one crossover for the two homologous chromosomes to segregate properly during meiosis. Crossovers connect the two chromosomes, creating tension when the homologs are pulled in opposite directions during metaphase I (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GNyMZaW23q" id="ben_9781319297145_KyzxNm82zi">Figure 2.19c</a>). This tension is necessary for the two homologs to separate properly in anaphase I. Research of crossover formation in humans demonstrates that the process of crossover maturation in females is often inefficient compared to that in males, leading to fewer mature crossovers in females and, among those that do occur, more crossovers that are likely to lead to missegregation of chromosomes during meiosis. This may account for the high levels of aneuploidy seen in human conceptions that originate in oogenesis. Furthermore, researchers have identified a genetic variant at the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nqQ6HNKXZA">Polo-like Kinase 4</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vfBxqVADt9">PLK4</i>) gene that increases the frequency of aneuploidy in humans. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GVk5K76iiI">PLK4</i> gene plays a role in regulating the centriole (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_9xqTAtXrFU">Chapter 2</a>), the disruption of which can lead to failure of the chromosomes to separate properly in mitosis.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_SOQtATXZwj">The most common aneuploidies seen in living humans are those that involve the sex chromosomes. As is true of all mammals, aneuploidy of the human sex chromosomes is better tolerated than aneuploidy of autosomes. Both Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Du6YlAiZj2" id="ben_9781319297145_6ZJxPA8p5Z">Figures 4.8</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_07FvDRQsKP" id="ben_9781319297145_GjzdQPQhC6">4.9</a>) result from aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_CfX0j1VB6K">Autosomal aneuploidies resulting in live births are less common than sex-chromosome aneuploidies in humans, probably because there is no mechanism of dosage compensation for autosomes. Most embryos with autosomal aneuploidies are spontaneously aborted, though occasionally fetuses with aneuploidies of some of the small autosomes, such as chromosome 21, complete development. Because these chromosomes are small and carry relatively few genes, the presence of extra copies is less detrimental than it is for larger chromosomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_oO6ydYfIvX">In 1866, John Langdon Down, physician and medical superintendent of the Earlswood Asylum in Surrey, England, noticed a remarkable resemblance among a number of his patients who were intellectually disabled: all of them possessed a broad, flat face, a small nose, and oval-shaped eyes. Their features were so similar, in fact, that he felt that they might easily be mistaken for children from the same family. Down did not understand the cause of their intellectual disability, but his original description faithfully records the physical characteristics of people with this genetic form of intellectual disability. In his honor, the disorder is today known as Down syndrome.</p>

Primary Down syndrome usually arises from spontaneous nondisjunction during egg formation: about 75% of the nondisjunction events that cause Down syndrome are maternal in origin, most arising in meiosis I. Most children with Down syndrome are born to unaffected parents, and the failure of the chromosomes to divide has little hereditary tendency. Therefore, a couple who has conceived one child with primary Down syndrome has only a slightly higher risk of conceiving a second child with Down syndrome (compared with other couples of similar age who have not had any children with Down syndrome). Similarly, the couple’s relatives are not more likely to have a child with primary Down syndrome.</p>

The small chromosome is generally lost after several cell divisions. Although exchange between chromosomes 21 and 14 is the most common cause of familial Down syndrome, the condition can also be caused by translocations between 21 and other chromosomes, such as 15.</p>

Cohesin (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_kBepbRQJlT">Chapter 2</a>) components of the spindle and other structures required for proper chromosome segregation may break down during the long arrest of meiosis, leading to more aneuploidy in children born to older mothers. No similar age effect is seen in males because sperm are produced continuously after puberty, with no long suspension of the meiotic divisions.</p>

Down syndrome results from three functional copies of chromosome 21, either through trisomy (primary Down syndrome) or a Robertsonian translocation (familial Down syndrome).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_P8EEv9dnUb">Normally, the two chromosomes of a homologous pair are inherited from two different parents—one from the father and one from the mother. The development of molecular techniques that facilitate the identification of specific DNA sequences (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_hQY4lM9AbH">Chapter 19</a>) has made the determination of the parental origins of chromosomes possible. Surprisingly, these techniques have revealed that sometimes both chromosomes are inherited from the same parent, a condition termed

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mVFUkWGFCr">Many cases of uniparental disomy probably originate as trisomies. Although most autosomal trisomies are lethal, a trisomic embryo can survive if one of the three chromosomes is lost early in development. If, just by chance, the two remaining chromosomes are both from the same parent, uniparental disomy results.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bXeW2Pq7is">Uniparental disomy violates the rule that children affected with a recessive disorder appear only in families in which both parents are carriers. For example, cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease; typically, both parents of an affected child are heterozygous for a cystic fibrosis mutation on chromosome 7. However, for a small proportion of people with cystic fibrosis, only one of the parents is heterozygous for a cystic fibrosis mutation. In these cases, cystic fibrosis is due to uniparental disomy: the person with cystic fibrosis has inherited two copies of the chromosome 7 that carries the defective cystic fibrosis allele from the heterozygous parent and no copy of the normal allele from the other parent.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_nEQiJNnCMg">Uniparental disomy has also been observed in Prader–Willi syndrome, a rare condition that arises when a paternal copy of a gene on chromosome 15 is missing. Although most cases of Prader–Willi syndrome result from a chromosome deletion that removes the paternal copy of the gene (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kxZlUxCA7s" id="ben_9781319297145_V3bEUKvXmz">Genomic Imprinting in Chapter 5</a>), 20% to 30% of the cases arise when both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the mother and no copy is inherited from the father.</p>

Growing evidence suggests that genetic mosaicism is more common than is often recognized. For example, about 50% of those diagnosed with Turner syndrome (individuals with a single X chromosome) are actually mosaics, possessing some 45,X cells and some normal 46,XX cells. A few may even be mosaics for two or more abnormal karyotypes. The 45,X/46,XX mosaic usually arises when an X chromosome is lost soon after fertilization in an XX embryo.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_L4dGKswjt3">Fruit flies that are XX/XO mosaics (O designates the absence of a homologous chromosome; XO means that the cell has a single X chromosome and no Y chromosome) develop a mixture of male and female traits because the presence of two X chromosomes produces female traits, and the presence of a single X chromosome produces male traits (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_V4imMT696H" id="ben_9781319297145_AhOYNjQ7SB"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_SV1pmFb5Zg">Figure 8.25</strong></a>).
