The folded layers extending out from the nuclei are components of the endoplasmic reticulum. The inside of the nucleus contains a sphere and D N A. The nucleus is enclosed in a nuclear envelope. Both cell diagrams also consist of ribosomes, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and a plasma membrane. The ribosomes are represented by tiny spheres. Mitochondria, oblong enveloped structures with the internal portion of the envelope membrane extending inwards into a number of stacked folds, appears in both cells. The Golgi apparatus, thin stacked cluster of ovular-shaped layers, is present in both the cells. Organelles that are only present in the plant cell are the vacuole, chloroplasts, and cell wall. The vacuole is large and is ovular-shaped which occupies about 50 percent of the inside of the plant cell.

An examination of equivalent DNA sequences reveals that bacteria and archaea are as distantly related to each other as they are to the eukaryotes. Thus, from an evolutionary perspective, there are three major groups of organisms: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Although bacteria and archaea are similar in cell structure, some genetic processes in archaea (such as transcription) are more similar to those in eukaryotes, and the archaea may be closer evolutionarily to eukaryotes than to bacteria. Some researchers propose that eukaryotes arose within the archaea and thus that there are two primary domains of life: the bacteria and another domain that includes the archaea and the eukaryotes. The evolutionary relationships among bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes remain uncertain, however, and are the focus of current research. In this book, the prokaryotic–eukaryotic distinction will be made frequently, but important bacterial–archaeal differences will also be noted.</p>

Histone proteins help regulate the accessibility of DNA to enzymes and other proteins that copy and read the DNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_bWujn2mTLh">Chapter 17</a>), and they also enable the DNA to fit into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_zN1q7ef4jA">Chapter 11</a>). Archaea also have some histone proteins that complex with DNA. The histones found in archaea are related to but distinct from those found in eukaryotes, and the structure of archaeal chromatin is different from that found in eukaryotes. Bacteria do not possess histones, and their DNA does not exist in the highly ordered, tightly packed arrangement found in eukaryotic cells. The copying and reading of DNA are therefore simpler processes in bacteria.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_efhBMhJd1a">The genes of prokaryotic cells are generally located on a single circular molecule of double-stranded DNA—the chromosome of a prokaryotic cell. In eukaryotic cells, genes are located on multiple, usually linear DNA molecules (multiple chromosomes). Eukaryotic cells therefore require mechanisms to ensure that a copy of each chromosome is faithfully transmitted to each new cell. However, this generalization—a single circular chromosome in prokaryotes and multiple linear chromosomes in eukaryotes—is not always true. A few bacteria have more than one chromosome, and important bacterial and archaeal genes are frequently found on other DNA molecules called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rF1oASl2dR">plasmids</i> (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sMlss9GGrV" id="ben_9781319297145_Irf0HIh8GH">Chapter 9</a>). Furthermore, in some eukaryotes, a few genes are located on circular DNA molecules found in certain organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_q97HqO8X3e">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
