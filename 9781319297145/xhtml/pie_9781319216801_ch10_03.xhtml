<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_7bHIN3gB6J">In 1868, Johann Friedrich Miescher (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Y0kuRrhnBz" id="ben_9781319297145_AqXlZyd0NH"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_tfuUHOTTtX">Figure 10.2</strong></a>) graduated from medical school in Switzerland. Influenced by an uncle who believed that the key to understanding disease lay in the chemistry of tissues, Miescher traveled to Tübingen, Germany, to study under Ernst Felix Hoppe-Seyler, an early leader in the emerging field of biochemistry. Under Hoppe-Seyler’s direction, Miescher turned his attention to the chemistry of pus, a substance of clear medical importance. Pus contains white blood cells, which have large nuclei, and Miescher developed a method for isolating these nuclei. The minute amounts of nuclear material that he obtained were insufficient for a thorough chemical analysis, but he did establish that the nuclear material contained a novel substance that was slightly acidic and high in phosphorus. This material, which we now know must have consisted of DNA and protein, Miescher called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2IAt8c5wHH">nuclein</i>. The substance was later renamed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_oCrVaSc47y">nucleic acid</i> by one of his students.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DIDMXVbMJf">By 1887, several researchers had independently concluded that the physical basis of heredity lies in the nucleus. Chromatin was shown to consist of nucleic acid and proteins, but which of these substances was actually the genetic information was not clear. In the late 1800s, Albrecht Kossel carried out further work on the chemistry of DNA and <span aria-label="296" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page296" role="doc-pagebreak" title="296"/>determined that it contains four nitrogenous bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine (abbreviated A, C, G, and T).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MkJdVwLljg">Levene incorrectly proposed that DNA consists of a series of four-nucleotide units, each containing all four bases—adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine—in a fixed sequence. This concept, known as the tetranucleotide hypothesis, implied that the structure of DNA was not variable enough to make it the genetic material. The tetranucleotide hypothesis contributed to the idea that protein is the genetic material because the structure of protein, with its 20 different amino acids, could be highly variable.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8dromQtiL3">As additional studies of the chemistry of DNA were completed in the 1940s and 1950s, the notion of DNA as a simple, invariant molecule began to change. Erwin Chargaff and his colleagues carefully measured the amounts of the four bases in DNA from a variety of organisms, and they found that DNA from different organisms varies greatly in base composition. This finding disproved the tetranucleotide hypothesis. They discovered that within each species, there is some regularity in the ratios of the bases: the amount of adenine is always equal to the amount of thymine (A = T), and the amount of guanine is always equal to the amount of cytosine (G = C) (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_49unfs7AgL"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YKE7OQ0eFi" id="ben_9781319297145_2RNNjEZK6q">Table 10.1</a></strong>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_dDiCHRMBLK">While chemists were working out the structure of DNA, biologists were attempting to identify the carrier of genetic information. Mendel identified the basic rules of heredity in 1866, but he had no idea about the physical nature of hereditary information. By the early 1900s, biologists had concluded that genes resided on chromosomes, which were known to contain both DNA and protein. Two sets of experiments, one conducted on bacteria and the other on viruses, provided pivotal evidence that DNA, rather than protein, was the genetic material.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5CxOztauGp">An initial step in identifying DNA as the source of genetic information came with the discovery of a phenomenon called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_plMoYM3yBc">transformation</i> (described in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GcMfia9hEx" id="ben_9781319297145_scNP9g9oga">Section 9.3</a>). This phenomenon was first observed in 1928 by Fred Griffith, an English physician whose special interest was the bacterium that causes pneumonia: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vRrZtg3VkH">Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. Griffith had succeeded in isolating several different strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_u33yGpbhLr">S. pneumoniae</i> (type I, II, III, and so forth). In the virulent (disease-causing) forms of a strain, each bacterium is surrounded by a polysaccharide coat, which makes the bacterial colony appear smooth (S) when grown on an agar plate. Griffith found that these virulent forms occasionally mutated to nonvirulent forms, which lack a polysaccharide coat and produce a rough-appearing colony (R).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_eXQEZ9tpDh">The results of these experiments were not unusual. However, Griffith got a surprise when he injected his mice with a small amount of living type IIR bacteria along with a large amount of heat-killed type IIIS bacteria. Because both the type IIR bacteria and the heat-killed type IIIS bacteria were nonvirulent, he expected these mice to live. Surprisingly, 5 days after the injections, the mice developed pneumonia and died (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qzAtqx0mG9" id="ben_9781319297145_cqDN6J6N01"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_UOtqh5wTjd">Figure 10.3d</strong></a>). When Griffith examined blood from the hearts of these mice, he observed live type IIIS bacteria. Furthermore, these bacteria retained their type IIIS characteristics through several generations: their virulence was heritable.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QCIBNDw0G1">Griffith considered all the possible interpretations of his results. First, there was a possibility that he had not sufficiently sterilized the type IIIS bacteria and thus a few live bacteria had remained in the culture. Any live bacteria injected into the mice would have multiplied and caused pneumonia. Griffith knew that this possibility was unlikely because he had used only heat-killed type IIIS bacteria in the control experiment, and they never produced pneumonia in the mice.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sdzoIBM3iq">A second interpretation was that the live type IIR bacteria had mutated to the virulent S form. Such a mutation would cause pneumonia in the mice, but it would produce type IIS bacteria, not the type IIIS that Griffith found in the dead mice. Because type II and type III bacteria differ in a number of traits, many mutations would be required for type II bacteria to mutate to type III bacteria, and the chance of all the mutations occurring simultaneously was impossibly low.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_1r0x7Z40Wt">Griffith concluded that the type IIR bacteria had somehow been transformed, acquiring the genetic virulence of the dead type IIIS bacteria, and that this transformation had produced a permanent genetic change in the bacteria. Although Griffith didn’t understand the nature of this transformation, he theorized that some substance in the dead bacteria might be responsible. He called this substance the

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_IhiIXIxWOr">At the time of Griffith’s report, Oswald Avery (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_NUzWA9tJIc" id="ben_9781319297145_eKmcdKmXdc">Figure 10.1</a>) was a microbiologist at the Rockefeller Institute. At first, Avery was skeptical of Griffith’s results, but after other microbiologists successfully repeated Griffith’s experiments with other bacteria, Avery set out to understand the nature of the transforming substance.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UUUTblcTWw">After 10 years of research, Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty succeeded in isolating and partially purifying the transforming substance. They showed that it had a chemical composition closely matching that of DNA and quite different from that of proteins. Enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, known to break down proteins, had no effect on the transforming substance. Ribonuclease, an enzyme that destroys RNA, also had no effect. Enzymes capable of destroying DNA, however, eliminated the biological activity of the transforming substance (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ufQ8woXY7b" id="ben_9781319297145_SpQGi3g9S1"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_NbyXYmkv7j">Figure 10.4</strong></a>). Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty showed that the transforming substance precipitated at about the same rate as purified DNA and that it absorbed ultraviolet light at the same wavelengths as DNA. These results, published in 1944, provided compelling evidence that the transforming principle—and therefore genetic <span aria-label="298" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page298" role="doc-pagebreak" title="298"/>information—resides in DNA. However, new theories in science are rarely accepted on the basis of a single experiment, and many biologists continued to prefer the hypothesis that the genetic material is protein.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xieAecewzh">Before Watson and Crick’s breakthrough, much of the basic chemistry of DNA had already been determined by Miescher, Kossel, Levene, Chargaff, and others, who had established that DNA consists of nucleotides and that each nucleotide contains a sugar, a nitrogenous base, and <span aria-label="300" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page300" role="doc-pagebreak" title="300"/>a phosphate group. However, how the nucleotides fit together in the three-dimensional structure of the molecule was not at all clear.</p>

However, his diffraction images did not provide enough resolution to reveal the structure. A research group at King’s College in London, led by Maurice Wilkins, also used X-ray diffraction to study DNA. Working in Wilkins’s laboratory, Rosalind Franklin obtained strikingly better images of the molecule. Rosalind Franklin was an excellent X-ray crystallographer, and her images were critical in the eventual elucidation of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9zsgQfPCYT">The key to solving the structure came when Watson recognized that an adenine base could bond with a thymine base and that a guanine base could bond with a cytosine base; these pairings accounted for the base ratios that Chargaff had discovered earlier. The model developed by Watson and Crick showed that DNA consists of two strands of nucleotides that run in opposite directions (are antiparallel) and wind around each other to form a right-handed helix, with the sugars and phosphates on the outside and the bases in the interior. They recognized that the double-stranded structure of DNA, with its specific base pairing, provided an elegant means by which DNA could be replicated. Watson and Crick published an electrifying description of their model in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_dtrRcrKSfo">Nature</i> in 1953. At the same time, Franklin and Wilkins each published their X-ray diffraction data, which demonstrated that DNA was helical in structure.</p>

For their discovery, Watson and Crick, along with Maurice Wilkins, were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1962. Rosalind Franklin had died of cancer in 1958 and thus could not be considered a candidate for the shared prize, but many scholars and historians believe that she should receive equal credit for solving the structure of DNA.</p>
