<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_SXutkfvKhA">One of the most remarkable of all DNA sequences is the human gene for dystrophin. This gene, located on the X chromosome, is enormous, encompassing 2.2 million base pairs, including 79 exons and 78 introns. Its product, dystrophin, connects the cytoskeleton of a muscle cell to its extracellular matrix and is critical for muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kJG6xQHQQV">Mutations in the dystrophin gene are the cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal muscle disorder that strikes nearly 1 in 3500 boys. At birth, these boys are healthy, but muscle weakness begins to appear between 3 and 5 years of age. As the disorder progresses, the child stumbles frequently, has difficulty climbing stairs, and is unable to rise from a sitting position. In time, the arm and leg muscles become progressively weaker. By age 11, most boys with the disorder must use a wheelchair, and by age 20, many have died. At present, there is no cure for the disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MRGm81zITv">Duchenne muscular dystrophy was first recognized in 1852, and the disease was fully described in 1861 by Benjamin A. Duchenne, a French physician. Even before Mendel’s laws were discovered, physicians noticed its X-linked pattern of inheritance, remarking that the disease developed almost exclusively in males and seemed to be inherited through unaffected mothers. In spite of this early recognition of its hereditary basis, the molecular basis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy remained a mystery for many years. In 1985, Louis Kunkel and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School observed that the X chromosome of a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy had a visible deletion. Reasoning that this boy’s disease was caused by the absence of a gene within that deletion, they used the deletion to pinpoint the location on the X chromosome of a gene that, when mutated or absent, caused Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Kunkel and his colleagues eventually located and cloned the piece of DNA responsible for the disease and discovered the dystrophin gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_evNW5fzXpN">Ever since the discovery of the dystrophin gene, researchers and physicians have dreamed of treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy with gene therapy—restoring dystrophin production by inserting a corrected copy of the dystrophin gene into the patient’s cells—but the large size of the dystrophin gene has made this approach challenging. Recently, however, geneticists have developed a novel and interesting approach to gene therapy that makes use of a new technique for editing the genome.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_uMR6eNVGXT">Many of the mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy consist of duplications or deletions that cause frameshift mutations, leading to premature stop codons that produce a truncated, nonfunctional dystrophin. The huge dystrophin protein consists of <span aria-label="570" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page570" role="doc-pagebreak" title="570"/>several domains. Some of these domains are not essential for muscle function. Researchers proposed that if the exons where mutations occurred could be removed, the premature stop codons would be eliminated. The resulting protein would be missing some amino acids, but a dystrophin that provided some muscle function might still be produced.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_R8I20ARHVT">The trick to making this strategy work is the ability to selectively edit DNA sequences that control the splicing of pre-mRNA. Until recently, that wasn’t possible. But within the past few years, a powerful new tool, called CRISPR-Cas9, has been developed that allows precision editing of the genome. In recent experiments, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to engineer changes in the genomes of mice, dogs, and humans that bring about exon skipping in the dystrophin gene, demonstrating the potential feasibility of this approach.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gmrlVpwkBS">The geneticists used a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Rj1C0zA9IU">mdx</i> mice. These mice possess a premature stop codon in exon 23 of the dystrophin gene and exhibit many of the symptoms of the human disorder. The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of a protein called Cas9 that cuts DNA, along with two RNA molecules that can be genetically engineered to guide Cas9 to specific sequences—in this case, to the ends of exon 23. The geneticists loaded viruses with genetic material encoding these CRISPR-Cas9 components, then injected <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_FslzeFmkv5">mdx</i> mice with the viruses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YrC67IU6Lo">The results were remarkable. Delivered by the virus, CRISPR-Cas9 entered muscle cells and produced double-stranded cuts on either side of exon 23. Exon 23, along with the disease-causing premature stop codon it contained, was removed from the genomes of some cells. The result was synthesis of a partially functional dystrophin protein that enhanced muscle function in the mice. In 2018, researchers used this same approach to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy in beagles, removing an exon with a mutation, which then restored dystrophin production in the dogs’ muscles. Researchers have also applied this method to cultured human stem cells from patients with muscular dystrophy and showed that the procedure restored dystrophin protein expression in derived heart cells (cardiomyocytes). This suggests that the procedure might also work in humans. Although much work needs to be done before these methods can be used to treat human patients, the results are encouraging and suggest that CRISPR-Cas9 might someday be used to restore muscle function to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_H2ZvmGm9Ld">Why does Duchenne muscular dystrophy affect only boys? Is it possible for it to occur in girls? If so, how might this take place?</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_qMaim5Ugxj">Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is another type of muscular dystrophy that results from mutations in the dystrophin gene, but its symptoms are less severe than those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). About 60% of the mutations that cause both DMD and BMD are deletions. In BMD but not DMD, some multiple of three base pairs is usually deleted. Propose an explanation for why the symptoms of BMD are usually less severe than those seen in DMD, and how this difference might be related to the types of deletions.</li>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_BUvzRV1UAO">The possibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 to genetically engineer a treatment for muscular dystrophy illustrates the power of molecular techniques for manipulating DNA sequences. This chapter introduces some of the techniques used in molecular genetic analysis. We begin by considering the challenges of working at the molecular level. We then examine a number of methods used to analyze and alter DNA, placing emphasis on several transformative techniques that are used to cut, clone, amplify, and sequence DNA. Finally, we explore some of the applications of molecular genetic analysis.</p>
