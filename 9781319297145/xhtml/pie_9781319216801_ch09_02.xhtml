<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_n9CMJKwxaN">The genetic systems of bacteria and viruses are studied because these organisms play critically important roles in human society and the world ecosystem. Viruses infect all living organisms and are, by far, the most common biological entity on Earth. They are the cause of many important diseases. Bacteria in the oceans produce 50% of the oxygen in the air and remove roughly 50% of the carbon dioxide. Bacteria and viruses also play critical roles in agriculture, serving as economically important pathogens of crops and domesticated animals, but also providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and other essential nutrients to our food plants. Bacteria are found naturally in the mouth, in the gut, and on the skin, where they are essential to human function and ecology. These complex communities of bacteria protect us from disease and are essential for digestion and other physiological functions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iZW9RD31Ez">Bacteria and viruses have immense medical significance because they cause many human diseases. Infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, although many of these diseases can be controlled through antibiotics and vaccines. Bacteria have also been harnessed to produce a number of economically important substances, including drugs, hormones, food additives, and other chemicals and compounds. And viruses are now being used in gene therapies.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Felko5wZZy">Bacteria and viruses are also important in the study of genetics because they possess a number of characteristics that make them suitable for genetic analysis (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_5gY0gIH2jY"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_T2u5HJoSYd" id="ben_9781319297145_XZhUlGBCg3">Table 9.1</a></strong>). Their simple genetic systems have a number of features in common with the genetic systems of humans and other more complex organisms, so information gleaned from the genetic study of bacteria and viruses often provides important insight into genetic principles that are applicable to many other organisms.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_f0wbObdyp6">Humans like to think that we rule the world, but we are clearly in a minor position compared with bacteria. Bacteria first evolved some 3.5 billion years ago, 2 billion years <span aria-label="259" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page259" role="doc-pagebreak" title="259"/>before the first eukaryotes appeared (or perhaps even earlier, as suggested by some evidence). Today, bacteria are found in every conceivable environment, including boiling springs, highly saline lakes, and beneath more than 2 miles of ice in Antarctica. They are found at the top of Mount Everest and at the bottom of the deepest oceans. They are also present on and in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_qf8pvUfPZi">us</i>—in astounding numbers! Within the average human gut, there are approximately 10 trillion bacteria, ten times the total number of cells in the entire human body. No one knows how many bacteria populate the world, but an analysis conducted by scientists in 1998 estimated that the total number of living bacteria on Earth exceeded 5 million trillion trillion (5 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_JLmSlFXtoz">30</sup>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rKHUdLh7fA">Bacteria are not only numerically vast but also constitute the majority of life’s diversity. The total number of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_uxdfCIfYwz">described</i> species of bacteria is less than 10,000, compared with about 1.4 million plants, animals, fungi, and single-celled eukaryotes. But the number of described species of bacteria falls far short of the true microbial diversity.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VumoM4depJ">Species of bacteria are typically described only after they have been cultivated and studied in the laboratory. Because only a few species are amenable to laboratory culture, it was impossible for many years to identify and study most bacteria. Then, in the 1970s, molecular techniques for analyzing DNA became available and opened up a whole new vista on microbial diversity. These techniques revealed several important facts about bacteria. First, many of the relations among bacteria that microbiologists had worked out on the basis of their physical and biochemical traits turned out to be incorrect. Bacteria once thought to be related were in fact genetically quite different. Second, molecular analysis showed that members of one group of microbes—now called the archaea—are as different from other bacteria as they are from eukaryotes. Third, molecular analysis revealed that the number of different types of bacteria is astounding.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OkJqef7NMj">In 2007, Luiz Roesch and his colleagues set out to determine exactly how many types of bacteria exist in a gram of soil. They obtained soil samples from four locations: Brazil, Canada, and Florida and Illinois in the United States. From these soil samples, they extracted and purified bacterial DNA. Using this DNA, they determined the sequences of a gene present in all bacteria, the 16S rRNA gene. Each bacterial species has a unique 16S rRNA gene sequence, so the researchers could determine how many species of bacteria existed in each soil sample by counting the different DNA sequences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cH9YoM7HPd">Roesch’s results were amazing. The number of different types of bacterial DNA in each gram of soil ranged from 26,140 for samples from Brazil to 53,533 for Canadian samples. Many unusual bacteria were detected, which appeared dissimilar to any previously described groups of bacteria. Another interesting finding was that soil from agricultural fields harbored considerably fewer species than did soil from forests.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZzwpdwXSII">This study and others demonstrate that bacterial diversity far exceeds that of multicellular organisms, and undoubtedly, numerous groups of bacteria have yet to be discovered. In 2010, researchers founded the Earth Microbiome Project, the focus of which is to sample microbial communities in diverse environments across the globe, with the aim of increasing our understanding of the microbial world and how it is organized. Like it or not, we truly live in a bacterial world. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_8Dh6mJnnAW">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_p3dI2bQ5ic" id="ben_9781319297145_b2LMWNUXAA">PROBLEM 18</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_agjgbUOw6y">Prokaryotes, as we saw in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_dHUBHTbmLm">Chapter 2</a>, are unicellular organisms that lack nuclear membranes and membrane-bounded organelles. For many years, biologists considered all prokaryotes to be related, but in recent years scientists have developed methods to isolate the DNA from bacteria that cannot be cultured in the laboratory and sequence their entire genome. This genome sequence information has revolutionized our understanding of microbial diversity. It is now clear that prokaryotes are divided into at least two distinct groups: the archaea and the eubacteria. The archaea are a group of diverse prokaryotes that are found in almost all environments, including extreme environments such as hot springs and the bottom of oceans. The archaea are a very diverse group of microbes, consisting of at least four major groups and numerous phyla. The eubacteria (usually referred to simply as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZZOrrsBgEf">bacteria</i>, as we generally do in this book) include most of the familiar bacterial species. Although superficially similar in their cell structure, bacteria and archaea are distinct in their genetic makeup, and the differences between them are as great as those between bacteria and eukaryotes. In fact, examination of their DNA sequences, as well as other evidence, indicates that archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than to eubacteria. Some experts are now challenging the long-held idea that life consists of three major groups (eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes), suggesting instead that there are only two domains of life—eubacteria and archaea—and that eukaryotes are just a branch within the archaeal domain.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_D8i5LjULLl">Bacteria are extremely diverse and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are rod-shaped, whereas others are spherical or helical. Most are much smaller than eukaryotic cells, but at least one species isolated from the guts of fish is almost 1 mm long and can be seen with the naked eye. Some bacteria are photosynthetic. Others produce stalks and spores, superficially resembling fungi.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EA0u5nbOwy">Bacteria have long been considered simple organisms that lack much of the cellular complexity of eukaryotes. However, evidence now points to a number of similarities and parallels in bacterial and eukaryotic structure. For example, a bacterial protein termed FtsZ, which plays an integral part in bacterial cell division, is structurally similar to eukaryotic tubulin proteins, which are subunits of microtubules and help segregate chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_TWdCQL2roj">Chapter 2</a>). Like eukaryotes, bacteria have proteins that help <span aria-label="260" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" role="doc-pagebreak" title="260"/>condense DNA. Other bacterial proteins function much as cytoskeletal proteins do in eukaryotes, helping give bacterial cells shape and structure. And although bacteria don’t undergo mitosis and meiosis, replication of the bacterial chromosome precedes binary fission, and there are bacterial processes that ensure that one copy of the chromosome is allocated to each daughter cell.</p>
