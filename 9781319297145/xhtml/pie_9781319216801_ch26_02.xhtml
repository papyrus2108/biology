<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lBHEsKsffB">The concept of evolution is one of the foundational principles of all of biology. Theodosius Dobzhansky, an important early leader in the field of evolutionary genetics, once remarked, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” Indeed, evolution is an all-encompassing theory that helps to make sense of much of the natural world, from the sequences of DNA found in our cells to the types of organisms that surround us. The evidence for evolution is overwhelming. Evolution has been directly observed numerous times; for example, hundreds of different insect species evolved resistance to common pesticides that were introduced after World War II. The theory of evolution is supported by the fossil record, comparative anatomy, embryology, the distribution of plants and animals (biogeography), and molecular genetics.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_9bmlJTPeHH">In spite of its vast importance to all fields of biology, evolution is often misunderstood and misinterpreted. In our society, the term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xGQAFuuyH9">evolution</i> frequently refers to any type of change. However,

Two aspects of this definition should be emphasized. First, biological evolution includes genetic change only. Many nongenetic changes take place in living organisms, such as the development of a complex, intelligent person from a single-celled zygote. Although remarkable, this change isn’t evolution because it does not include genetic changes. Second, biological evolution takes place in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jJiHjxcjJf">groups</i> of organisms. An individual organism does not evolve; what evolves is the gene pool common to a group of organisms.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_A9sKtRRscQ">Evolution can be thought of as a two-step process. In the first step, genetic variation arises. Genetic variation has its origin in the processes of mutation, which produces new alleles, and recombination, which shuffles alleles into new combinations. Both of these processes are random and produce genetic variation continually, regardless of evolution’s requirement for it. The second step in the process of evolution is change in the frequencies of genetic variants. The various evolutionary forces discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNqy757pBo" id="ben_9781319297145_BctNW6V7T5">Chapter 25</a> cause some alleles in the gene pool to increase in frequency and other alleles to decrease in frequency. This shift in the composition of the gene pool common to a group of organisms constitutes evolutionary change.</p>

Two hundred years ago, bighorn sheep were numerous throughout western North America, ranging from Mexico to southern Alberta and from Colorado to California. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark reported numerous sightings of these animals in their expedition across the western United States from 1804 to 1806. Before 1900, there were an estimated 2 million bighorn sheep in North America. But today, fewer than 70,000 of these beautiful animals remain, their numbers decimated by loss of habitat, competition from livestock, diseases carried by domesticated sheep, and hunting.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_1lwBG6C6DG">Bighorn sheep have not just decreased in number as a result of hunting; they have also evolved. Researchers have been studying the evolution of bighorn sheep in response to trophy hunting at Ram Mountain, Canada, since 1973. This population was intensively hunted until 1996, when hunting regulations increased the minimum size of the horns of rams (males) that could be shot, after which the number of rams killed by hunters each year decreased dramatically. In 2011, hunting at Ram Mountain ceased entirely. Trophy hunters selectively shoot rams with large horns, often before they are able to reproduce, producing artificial selection for smaller horns in rams. To study the effect of this artificial selection on the population, David Coltman and his colleagues collected blood, hair, and ear samples from bighorn sheep on Ram Mountain. They extracted DNA from the samples and used PCR to amplify it. The DNA revealed variation at 20 microsatellite loci. The researchers used this variation to determine paternity in the sheep and created a detailed pedigree for the population. Using these family relationships and the quantitative genetic techniques described in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_9qSZO3sHgt" id="ben_9781319297145_ILdxews2w2">Chapter 24</a>, they were able to show that horn size in rams (as well as in females, or ewes) had moderate heritability.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hRI624xrIE">The researchers observed that, in response to selective pressure imposed by the hunters, the horn length of rams decreased by almost 30% between 1973 and 1996. After hunting pressure decreased in 1996, horn length rebounded, increasing by about 13%. Through their genetic analysis, the researchers demonstrated that the decrease in horn length during the period of intensive hunting was an evolutionary response. Although a similar conclusion from an earlier study was criticized by some geneticists, who suggested that factors other than selection might account for the decrease in horn length, a 2016 analysis of the data confirmed that the evolutionary changes observed were due to selection. Ironically, the killing of trophy rams with large horns on Ram Mountain led to a decrease in the very traits prized by the hunters.</p>
