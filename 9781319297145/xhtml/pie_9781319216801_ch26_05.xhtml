Because most evolution takes place over long periods and is not amenable to direct observation, biologists must reconstruct phylogenies by inferring the evolutionary relationships among present-day organisms. The discovery of fossils of ancestral organisms can aid in the reconstruction of phylogenies, but the fossil record is often too poor to be of much help. Thus, biologists are often restricted to analyses of characteristics in present-day organisms to determine their evolutionary relationships. In the past, phylogenies were reconstructed on the basis of phenotypic characteristics—often, anatomical traits. Today, molecular data, including protein and DNA sequences, are frequently used for this purpose.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_y0NbryGoH4">Phylogenies are reconstructed by inferring changes that have taken place in homologous characteristics: those that have evolved from the same character in a common ancestor. For example, although the front leg of a mouse and the wing of a bat look different and have different functions, close examination of their structure and development reveals that they are indeed homologous; both evolved from the forelimb of an early mammal that was an ancestor to both the mouse and the bat. And, because the mouse and the bat have these homologous features and others in common, we know that they are both mammals. Similarly, DNA sequences are homologous if two present-day sequences evolved from a single sequence found in an ancestor. For example, all eukaryotic organisms have a gene for cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_45Z4QmvF9f">c</i>, an enzyme that helps carry out oxidative respiration. This gene is assumed to have arisen in a single organism in the distant past and to have been passed down to descendants of that early ancestor. Today, all copies of the cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_WrEi2Wbo3G">c</i> gene are homologous because they all evolved from the same original copy in the distant ancestor of all organisms that possess this gene.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_6dS4jIVUs9">Phylogenetic trees can be represented in several different ways, which sometimes creates confusion. The organisms in the tree can also be flipped or rotated around a node without changing their evolutionary relationships. For example, the wolf and human in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fz09cvwa5I" id="ben_9781319297145_4WgFL5j61p"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_PmdEWkdMdH">Figure 26.13a</strong></a> can be rotated about their common ancestor, producing <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fz09cvwa5I" id="ben_9781319297145_VJzqujTxxJ"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_0LjQuX3lg1">Figure 26.13b</strong></a>, which is the same phylogeny (same evolutionary relationships) as that in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fz09cvwa5I" id="ben_9781319297145_ubljhjAOHz">Figure 26.13a</a>. What this means is that whether two organisms lie adjacent to each other in the phylogenetic tree does not necessarily indicate a close evolutionary relationship. You might assume, looking at <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fz09cvwa5I" id="ben_9781319297145_5IhlNVWqK2">Figure 26.13a</a>, that wolves are more closely related to alligators than humans are to alligators, because wolves and alligators are physically next to each other in the tree.

Which organisms are more closely related: alligators and fish, or alligators and humans? You might, at first, be tempted to say alligators and fish, because the alligator and fish lie next to each other in the phylogenetic tree.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_pqJf31VKW3">Consider a simple phylogeny that depicts the evolutionary relationships among three organisms: humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Charles Darwin originally proposed that chimpanzees and gorillas were closely related to humans, and modern research supports a close relationship between these three species. There are three possible phylogenetic trees for humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_C6sPEmBGSV" id="ben_9781319297145_jCqcbI9ylJ"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_zgFn23ej8W">Figure 26.15</strong></a>). The goal of the evolutionary biologist is to determine which of the trees is correct. Molecular data applied to this question strongly suggest a close relationship between humans and chimpanzees.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_SPUKnklyRT">As the number of organisms in the phylogeny increases beyond just a few, the number of possible rooted trees becomes astronomically large. Clearly, choosing the best tree by directly comparing all the possibilities is impossible.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_4L73C0SDhQ">There are several different approaches to inferring evolutionary relationships and constructing phylogenetic trees. In one approach, termed the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fAPLDNKcIf">distance approach</i>, evolutionary relationships are inferred on the basis of the overall degree of similarity between organisms. Typically, a number of different phenotypic characteristics or gene sequences are examined, and the organisms are grouped on the basis of their overall similarity, taking into consideration all the examined characteristics and sequences. A second approach, called the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_CDCDLGCsfg">maximum parsimony approach</i>, infers phylogenetic relationships on the basis of the fewest number of evolutionary changes that must have taken place since the organisms last had an ancestor in common. A third approach, called <span aria-label="813" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page813" role="doc-pagebreak" title="813"/><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2NmsKenu3U">maximum likelihood</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ndwPiSzIH9">Bayesian methods</i>, infers phylogenetic relationships on the basis of which phylogeny maximizes the probability of obtaining the set of characteristics exhibited by the organisms. In this approach, a phylogeny with a higher probability of producing the observed characteristics in the organisms studied is preferred over a phylogeny with a lower probability. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods incorporate models of how evolutionary change takes place. For example, they incorporate the probability that one particular DNA base will be substituted for a different base.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9JpcR1J4Sv">With all three approaches to constructing phylogenies, several different numerical methods are available for the construction of phylogenetic trees. All include certain assumptions that help limit the number of different trees that must be considered; most rely on computer programs that compare phenotypic characteristics or sequence data to sequentially group organisms in the construction of a tree.</p>
