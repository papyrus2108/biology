<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_0sKBCnpbk5">A vast array of molecular methods is now available for probing the nature of hereditary information and revealing the details of genetic processes. These molecular techniques have drastically altered the way in which genes are studied. Previously, information about the structure and organization of genes was gained by examining their phenotypic effects, but molecular genetic analysis now enables scientists to directly <span aria-label="571" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page571" role="doc-pagebreak" title="571"/>read the nucleotide sequences themselves. This analysis has provided new information about the structure and function of genes and has altered many fundamental concepts of genetics. Our detailed understanding of genetic processes, such as replication, transcription, translation, RNA processing, and gene regulation, has been obtained through the use of molecular genetic techniques. These techniques are also used in many other fields, including biochemistry, microbiology, developmental biology, neurobiology, evolution, and ecology. Molecular genetic techniques are also being used to create a number of commercial products, including drugs, hormones, enzymes, and crops (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_P1bAsWcDCX"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_87mKukFEio" id="ben_9781319297145_ffnFSOe7OF">Figure 19.1</a></strong>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_do6DFwkfRg">The field of molecular genetics had its inception with the discovery of the three-dimensional structure of DNA by Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins in 1953. Since that discovery, the field has witnessed at least four major transformations, each driven by the development of powerful new techniques that provided important new insights into basic genetic processes. These seminal transformations include (1) the development of recombinant DNA technology, which allowed DNA from different sources to be combined; (2) the invention of the polymerase chain reaction, which allowed very small quantities of specific DNA fragments to be quickly amplified; (3) the development of quick and accurate methods of determining DNA sequences; and (4) the engineering of CRISPR-Cas systems for accurate and efficient editing of genome sequences. In this chapter, we discuss each of these methods, along with supporting techniques and some of their applications.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_IfFIn2liJv">Molecular genetic techniques are used to locate, analyze, alter, sequence, study, and recombine DNA sequences. These techniques are used to probe the structure and function of genes, address questions in many areas of biology, create commercial products, and diagnose and treat diseases. Four key innovations that have revolutionized genetics include recombinant DNA technology, the polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing technology, and genome editing methods.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Vx1Svn2jiq">The manipulation of genes at the molecular level presents a serious challenge, often requiring strategies that may not seem obvious at first. The basic problem is that genes are minute, and every cell contains thousands of them. Individual nucleotides cannot be seen, and no physical features mark the beginning or the end of a gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6B8BqL0202">Let’s consider a typical situation faced by a molecular geneticist. Suppose we want to use bacteria to produce large quantities of a human protein. The first and most formidable problem is finding the gene that encodes the desired protein. A haploid human genome consists of 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA. Let’s assume that the gene that we want to isolate is 3000 bp long. Our target gene occupies only one-millionth of the genome, so searching for our gene in the huge expanse of genomic DNA is more difficult than looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. But even if we are able to locate the gene, how do we separate it from the rest of the DNA?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_r3aYmCSxwF">If we succeed in locating and isolating the desired gene, we will next need to insert it into a bacterial cell. Linear fragments of DNA are quickly degraded by bacteria, so the gene must be inserted in a stable form. It must also be able to replicate successfully, or it will not be passed on when the cell divides. If we succeed in transferring our gene to bacteria in a stable form, we must still ensure that the gene is properly transcribed and translated. Furthermore, the methods used to isolate and transfer genes are inefficient: of a million bacterial cells that are subjected to these procedures, only <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vTCGWn5wiu">one</i> cell might successfully take up and express the human gene. So we must search through many cells to find the one containing the recombinant DNA. We are back to the problem of the needle in a haystack.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sr8SPHw5hj">Although these problems might seem insurmountable, molecular techniques have been developed to overcome them. Human genes are now routinely transferred to, and expressed in, bacterial cells.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_FnPNm3noJ4">Molecular genetic analyses require special techniques because individual genes make up a tiny fraction of the cellular DNA and cannot be seen.</p>
