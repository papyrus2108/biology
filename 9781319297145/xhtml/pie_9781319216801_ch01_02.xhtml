<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_7WNScKlKMQ">Albinism among the Hopis illustrates the important role that genes play in our lives. This one genetic alteration, among the 20,000 genes that humans possess, completely changes the life of a Hopi who possesses it. It alters his or her occupation, role in Hopi society, and relations with other members of the tribe. We all possess genes that influence our lives in significant ways. Genes affect our height, weight, hair color, and skin pigmentation. They affect our susceptibility to many diseases and disorders (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_sLvvgEw7t0"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_SLsKx4E4So" id="ben_9781319297145_zXXyildHF0">Figure 1.2</a></strong>) and even contribute to our intelligence and personality. Genes are fundamental to who and what we are, but they alone do not define us. Many factors—genetic and environmental—help determine our traits. A fundamental problem in genetics is separating the genetic and environmental influences on individual variation.</p>

The rise of agriculture began when people started to apply genetic principles to the domestication of plants and animals. Today, the major crops and animals used in agriculture are quite different from their wild progenitors, having undergone extensive genetic alteration that increased their yields and provided many desirable traits, such as disease and pest resistance, special nutritional qualities, and characteristics that facilitate harvest. The Green Revolution, which expanded food production throughout the world in the 1950s and 1960s, relied heavily on the application of genetic methods and principles (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_W1rSF14mog"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_zfc7oQn0t2" id="ben_9781319297145_0u3BfKtEUo">Figure 1.3</a></strong>). Today, genetically engineered corn, soybeans, canola (rapeseed), squash, sugar beets, and other crops constitute a significant proportion of all the food produced worldwide.</p>

Numerous drugs and food additives are synthesized by fungi and bacteria that have been genetically manipulated to make them efficient producers <span aria-label="4" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" role="doc-pagebreak" title="4"/>of these substances. The biotechnology industry employs molecular genetic techniques to develop and mass-produce substances of commercial value. Antimalarial drugs, growth hormone, insulin, clotting factor, antiviral drugs, enzymes, antibiotics, vaccines, and many other compounds are now produced commercially by genetically engineered bacteria and other organisms (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_p3bw2RI3Kz"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_q0KoZfB09L" id="ben_9781319297145_pVNwH6HXax">Figure 1.4</a></strong>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MdCRSHB0Yx">Genetics also plays a critical role in medicine. Physicians recognize that many diseases and disorders have a hereditary component, including rare genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anemia and Huntington disease, as well as many common diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. Advances in genetics have resulted in important insights into the nature of diseases such as cancer and in the development of diagnostic tests, including tests that identify disease-causing mutations as well as pathogens. Genomic data are helping to usher in the era of personalized medicine. Rapid, low-cost sequencing methods now allow us to obtain a person’s complete genome sequence, which provides important information about that person’s susceptibilities to diseases and likely responses to particular treatments. And gene therapy—the direct alteration of genes to treat human diseases—has now been administered to thousands of patients, although its use is still experimental and limited.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_oQfUjvrVtq">Although an understanding of genetics is important to all people, it is critical to the student of biology. Genetics provides one of biology’s unifying principles: all organisms use genetic systems that have a number of features in common. Genetics also undergirds the study of many other biological disciplines. Evolution, for example, is genetic change taking place over time, so the study of evolution requires an understanding of genetics. Developmental biology relies heavily on genetics: tissues and organs develop through the regulated expression of genes (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_94H2hrNjRm"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YoZMDJvS0B" id="ben_9781319297145_jcXub6865T">Figure 1.5</a></strong>). Even such fields as taxonomy, ecology, and animal behavior are making increasing use of genetic methods. The study of almost any field of biology or medicine is incomplete without a thorough understanding of genes and genetic methods.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Uc4hNTifls">Life on Earth exists in a tremendous array of forms and features, occupying almost every conceivable environment. Life is also characterized by adaptation: many organisms are exquisitely suited to the environment in which they are found. The history of life is a chronicle of new forms of life emerging, old forms disappearing, and existing forms changing.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VwIyBapNxN">Despite their tremendous diversity, living organisms have an important feature in common: all use similar genetic systems. The complete set of genetic instructions for any organism is its 
<dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="ben_9781319297145_7aOxNukgXH"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_glossary.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_eDGHfKSxEx" id="ben_9781319297145_tRiYjOMcIw" role="doc-glossref">genome</a></dfn>, and all genomes are encoded in nucleic acids—either DNA or RNA. The coding system for genomic information is also common to all life: genetic instructions are in the same format and, with rare exceptions, the code words are identical. Likewise, the process by which genetic information is copied and decoded is remarkably similar for all forms of life. These common features suggest that all life on Earth evolved from the same primordial ancestor, which arose between 3.5 billion and 4 billion years ago. Biologist Richard Dawkins describes life as a river of DNA that runs through time, connecting all organisms past and present.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iV0aY9Gv5g">That all organisms have similar genetic systems means that the study of one organism’s genes reveals principles that apply to other organisms. Investigations of how bacterial DNA is replicated (copied), for example, provide information that applies to the replication of human DNA. It also means that genes can often function in foreign cells, which makes genetic engineering possible. Unfortunately, the similarity of genetic systems is also the basis for diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), in which viral genes are able to function—sometimes with alarming efficiency—in human cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wIHXljY64S"><span aria-label="5" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page5" role="doc-pagebreak" title="5"/>Life’s diversity and adaptations are products of evolution, which is simply genetic change over time. Evolution is a two-step process: first, inherited differences arise randomly, and then the proportion of individuals with particular differences increases or decreases. Genetic variation is therefore the foundation of all evolutionary change and is ultimately the basis of all life as we know it. Techniques of molecular genetics are now routinely used to decipher evolutionary relationships among organisms; for example, analysis of DNA isolated from Neanderthal fossils has yielded new information concerning the relationship between Neanderthals and modern humans, demonstrating that Neanderthals and the ancestors of modern humans interbred some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. Genetics and the study of genetic variation are critical to understanding the past, present, and future of life. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_8BRdyDNjPm">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JG8OpPUcOM" id="ben_9781319297145_YNFB5LKe9d">PROBLEM 17</a></strong></p>

They collected 35,000 seawater samples and extracted DNA from each. The DNA was then sequenced and analyzed, revealing the presence of 150,000 genetically distinct types of eukaryotes. Most of these eukaryotes were newly discovered single-celled organisms. The researchers also detected 5000 viruses, only 39 of which were previously known to science.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QljJifgiM1">Division of the study of genetics into these three subdisciplines is convenient and traditional, but we should recognize not only that they overlap but also that each one can be further divided into a number of more specialized fields, such as chromosomal genetics, biochemical genetics, and quantitative genetics. Alternatively, genetic studies can be subdivided by organism (fruit fly, corn, or bacterial genetics), and each of these organisms may be studied at the levels of transmission, molecular, and population genetics. Modern genetics is an extremely broad field, encompassing many interrelated subdisciplines and specializations. <span class="keep" id="ben_9781319297145_e26dzP6VPW"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_NP12wfo2CR">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_PwmraVsJNA" id="ben_9781319297145_EwgL8dAoPW">PROBLEM 18</a></strong></span></p>

However, all possess life cycles and traits that make them particularly suitable for genetic study, including a short generation time, large but manageable numbers of progeny, adaptability to a laboratory environment, and the ability to be housed and propagated inexpensively.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_to9bMd6zuu">The value of model genetic organisms is illustrated by the use of zebrafish to identify genes that affect skin pigmentation in humans. For many years, geneticists recognized that differences in pigmentation among human ethnic groups were genetic (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_veVMS0ofMK"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_MvxnkxfsOU" id="ben_9781319297145_yBoi1h0bBH">Figure 1.8a</a></strong>), but the genes causing these differences were largely unknown.

The mutant zebrafish called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Jyy2xytOEO">golden</i> has light pigmentation due to the presence of fewer, smaller, and less dense pigment-containing structures called melanosomes in its cells (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_MvxnkxfsOU" id="ben_9781319297145_pYryn5Jmha"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_uS2hHrzrJ4">Figure 1.8b</strong></a>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tu4UZ1jZB8">Keith Cheng and his colleagues hypothesized that light skin in humans might result from a mutation that is similar to the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ohawYc7sHf">golden</i> mutation in zebrafish. Taking advantage of the ease with which zebrafish can be manipulated in the laboratory, they isolated and sequenced the gene responsible for the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_12Hik04kk4">golden</i> mutation and found that it encodes a protein that takes part in calcium uptake by melanosomes. They then searched a database of all known human genes and found a similar gene called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZfXZ6OaQfe">SLC24A5</i>, which encodes a protein that has the same function in human cells. When they examined human populations, they found that light-skinned Europeans often possess one form of this gene, whereas darker-skinned Africans, East Asians, and Native Americans usually possess a different form. Many other genes also affect pigmentation in humans, as illustrated by the mutations in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7h6qD20xYm">OCA2</i> gene that produce albinism among the Hopis (discussed in the introduction to this chapter). Nevertheless, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TMiyD0nmay">SLC24A5</i> appears to be responsible for 24% to 38% of the differences in pigmentation between Africans and Europeans.</p>
