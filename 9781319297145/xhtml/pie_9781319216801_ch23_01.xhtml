<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_6OnAt30O9L">In 1969, two American physicians, Frederick Pei Li and Joseph F. Fraumeni, were examining medical records of 648 children who had rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare type of cancer that occurs in the soft tissues, mostly muscles. Li and Fraumeni discovered something remarkable—some of the individuals in their database were siblings and cousins. Upon closer examination, they found four families in which a number of the family members exhibited striking histories of diverse types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and bone cancer. Li and Fraumeni recognized that these families exhibited a predisposition, not to a particular type of cancer but rather to cancer in general. Further research showed that their predisposition was inherited as a simple autosomal dominant trait (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_uvSx9GEsm2"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_QSHS0baxXg" id="ben_9781319297145_VZpMsmhTNN">Figure 23.1</a></strong>). Li and Fraumeni described this condition as a new cancer syndrome, which later became known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LsjV8BRptM">The families identified by Li and Fraumeni were exceptional. Most cancers do not develop until later in life, and most are not inherited. The study of Li-Fraumeni families, however, suggested that cancer could be inherited, and pointed the way toward our current understanding that cancer is, at its core, a genetic disease. As we will see, most cancers arise through the accumulation of several somatic mutations, mutations that are not passed on. However, sometimes people inherit a germ-line mutation in one of the genes that contributes to cancer progression. These individuals are predisposed to cancer because fewer additional somatic mutations are required for the cancer to develop.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sMYJRaQTzv">Subsequent research on Li-Fraumeni families showed that many of these individuals inherited a germ-line mutation in their <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nfdIJsbFF8">TP53</i> gene, a gene that encodes a vital protein called p53. The p53 protein has been called the “guardian of the genome” because, through its multiple functions, p53 maintains the integrity of the genome and prevents cells from becoming cancerous. <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3RnLrrC9jv">TP53</i> is a tumor-suppressor gene, producing a protein that ensures that cell division only takes place under appropriate conditions. When the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_UEGNwQDa4b">TP53</i> gene is mutated, cell division is unregulated and abnormal, and tumors develop. Males with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a 75% lifetime risk of cancer, and females have a <span aria-label="706" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page706" role="doc-pagebreak" title="706"/>lifetime risk of almost 100%. For these people, the probability of developing cancer is 85 times greater than for those in the general population.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5lYTs5PaLf">Mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0MkVibZNRZ">TP53</i> are not just associated with cancer in Li-Fraumeni families. Further research has shown that <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_8h9Daj90Mt">TP53</i> plays an important role in spontaneous cancers as well. Approximately 50% of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_pAa3Dis3SW">all</i> tumors have mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_c1XD4IUl4V">TP53</i>, and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rpSEDoLUiJ">TP53</i> mutations are associated with many different types of cancers. p53 is a DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcription factor, regulating transcription, and most of the mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wpYSqZbQSA">TP53</i> that are associated with cancer occur in the DNA-binding domain of p53.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ivuvmGT692">The p53 protein has a number of different functions in a normal cell. It is critical for proper functioning of the G1/S checkpoint in the cell cycle. If DNA damage is present, p53 is activated and prevents the cell from moving into S phase, where DNA replication would normally take place. This arrest in the cell cycle allows time for DNA-repair mechanisms to correct the damage and prevents the propagation of mutations that might lead to cancer. When p53 is defective, this vital checkpoint is bypassed and damaged DNA gets perpetuated, leading to somatic mutations that contribute to the cancer process.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZnvqCzi5ZP">In ways that are not fully understood, p53 also helps to stabilize the genome. Cells with mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_68lJ0nDFNF">TP53</i> are often aneuploid, containing too many or too few chromosomes. Thus, p53 helps maintain the integrity of the genome, probably by regulating processes that normally lead to proper chromosome duplication and segregation. In yet another function, p53 affects apoptosis. When cells sustain DNA damage or develop abnormal chromosomes, apoptosis leads to cell death, eliminating these aberrant cells before they can multiply and become cancerous. However, when <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_6D34dvvXSx">TP53</i> is mutated, apoptosis does not occur normally, and aberrant cells continue to propagate. p53 also suppresses the movement of retrotransposons, which otherwise can insert into genes and cause mutations that may lead to cancer. Recent research demonstrates that p53 plays a role in a number of other critical functions and cellular pathways, such as metabolism and development. The bottom line is that p53 is critical to proper functioning of the cell; when <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_4flQkIt7Qq">TP53</i> is mutated, things go wrong and cells become cancerous.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hFrD3JKk5z">In spite of all the research that has focused on p53 and its role in cancer, there is, unfortunately, no cure for those with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, although their cancers <span aria-label="707" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page707" role="doc-pagebreak" title="707"/>can be treated. Even with the tremendous amount of research that has been devoted to understanding p53, physicians still have difficulty predicting when cancer will occur or what types of cancer may arise. Research into p53 has, however, greatly advanced our understanding of cancer in general.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_VkXFvWoAbP">The discovery of p53’s link to cancer illustrates the power of modern molecular genetics to unravel the biological nature of cancer. In this chapter, we examine the genetic nature of cancer, a disease that is fundamentally genetic but is not often inherited. We begin by considering the multiple genetic alterations required to transform a normal cell into a cancerous one. We then consider some of the types of genes that contribute to cancer, including oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, genes that control the cell cycle, genes encoding DNA-repair systems and telomerase, and genes that contribute to the spread of cancer. Next, we take a look at epigenetic changes associated with cancer and, as an example, we examine how specific genes contribute to the progression of colon cancer. Finally, we discuss chromosome mutations associated with cancer and the role of viruses in some cancers.</p>
