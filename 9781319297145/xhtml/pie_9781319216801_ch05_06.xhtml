For example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_cfOst0KBNv">himalayan</i> allele in rabbits produces dark fur at the extremities of the body—on the nose, ears, and feet (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_zmxOKINp75" id="ben_9781319297145_r08mh1WTqL"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_6aeGgqfRwE">Figure 5.20</strong></a>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Q0TUrdAXck">Environmental factors also play an important role in the expression of a number of human genetic diseases. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to an autosomal recessive allele that causes intellectual disability. The disorder arises from a defect in an enzyme that normally metabolizes the amino acid phenylalanine. When this enzyme is defective, phenylalanine is not metabolized, and its buildup causes neurological damage in children. A simple environmental change, putting an affected child on a low-phenylalanine diet, prevents the development of intellectual disability.</p>

Such characteristics, which have a few easily distinguished phenotypes, are called

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_G8wvQB5TXl">Continuous characteristics frequently arise because genes at many loci interact to produce the phenotypes.

Many genes exhibit pleiotropy. Phenylketonuria, mentioned earlier, results from a recessive allele; people homozygous for this allele, if untreated, exhibit intellectual disability, blue eyes, and light skin color. The lethal allele that causes yellow coat color in mice is also pleiotropic. In addition to its lethality and its effect on coat color, the gene causes a diabetes-like condition, obesity, and an increased propensity to develop tumors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Ga8DAVz1Ob">The phenotypes of many continuous characteristics are also influenced by environmental factors. In these cases, each genotype is capable of producing a range of phenotypes, and the particular phenotype that results depends on both the genotype and the environmental conditions in which the genotype develops. For example, there may be only three genotypes at a single locus, but because each genotype produces a range of phenotypes associated with different environments, the phenotype of the characteristic will exhibit a continuous distribution. Many continuous characteristics are both polygenic and influenced by environmental factors; such characteristics are called

However, because many genes are involved, because environmental factors influence the phenotype, and because the phenotypes do not sort out into a few distinct types, we cannot observe the distinct ratios that have allowed us to interpret the genetic basis of discontinuous characteristics.
