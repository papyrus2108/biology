<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_mANe7pkDfj">The integrity of DNA is under constant assault from radiation, chemical mutagens, and spontaneously arising changes. In spite of these damaging agents, the rate of mutation remains remarkably low, thanks to the efficiency with which DNA is repaired.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mO5vIdEcYI">There are a number of complex pathways for repairing DNA, but several general statements can be made about DNA repair. First, most DNA-repair mechanisms require two nucleotide strands of DNA because most replace whole nucleotides, and a template strand is needed to specify the base sequence.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_h20UezykET">A second general feature of DNA repair is redundancy, meaning that many types of DNA damage can be corrected by more than one repair system. This redundancy illustrates the extreme importance of DNA repair to the survival of the cell: if a mistake escapes one repair system, it’s likely to be repaired by another system, ensuring that almost all mistakes are corrected.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_oBvm1VL5ft">Much research has been conducted on mechanisms of DNA repair, and the 2015 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar for their pioneering work on DNA repair. Here we consider five general mechanisms of DNA repair: mismatch repair, direct repair, base-excision repair, nucleotide-excision repair, and repair of double-strand breaks.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_29x4UflIZH">Replication is extremely accurate: each new copy of DNA has less than one error per billion nucleotides. However, in the process of replication, mismatched bases are incorporated into the new DNA with a frequency of about 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_9SVOGE5KoH">−4</sup> to 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_kS5GDoDVWJ">−5</sup>; this discrepancy shows that most of the errors that initially arise are corrected and never become permanent mutations. Some of these corrections are made in proofreading (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_04.xhtml#page359" id="ben_9781319297145_OhMbXdnC0S">p. 359 in Chapter 12</a>) by the DNA polymerases.</p>

However, some nucleotide repeats may form secondary structures on the unpaired strand (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_uuTIQQYaZD" id="ben_9781319297145_Q2j68SpcH4">Figure 18.5</a>), allowing them to escape detection by the mismatch-repair system.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_KSF6tGnp7N">After an incorporated error has been recognized, the mismatch-repair enzymes cut out a section of the newly synthesized strand and fill the gap with new nucleotides by using the original DNA strand as a template.

However, some nucleotide repeats may form secondary structures on the unpaired strand (see Figure 18 point 5), allowing them to escape detection by the mismatch-repair system. After an incorporated error has been recognized, the mismatch-repair enzymes cut out a section of the newly synthesized strand and fill the gap with new nucleotides by using the original D N A strand as a template. For this strategy to work, mismatch repair must have some way of distinguishing between the old and the new strands of the D N A so that the incorporated error, but not part of the original strand, is removed.

What do these mechanisms have in common? How are they different? Most mechanisms of DNA repair depend on the presence of two strands because nucleotides in the damaged area are removed and replaced. Nucleotides are replaced in mismatch repair, base-excision repair, and nucleotide-excision repair, but are not replaced by direct-repair mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YvmjyDbUlj">Repair mechanisms that include nucleotide removal use a common four-step pathway:</p>
<ol class="numbered-list" id="ben_9781319297145_dp0jBlvQqg">

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_K480m3XLdp">The primary differences in the mechanisms of mismatch, base-excision, and nucleotide-excision repair are in the details of detection and excision. In base-excision and mismatch repair, a single nick is made in the sugar–phosphate backbone on one side of the damage; in nucleotide-excision repair, nicks are made on both sides of the DNA lesion. In base-excision repair, DNA polymerase displaces the old nucleotides as it adds new nucleotides to the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_yLZX3MYkXD">′</sup> end of the nick; in mismatch repair, the old nucleotides are degraded; and in nucleotide-excision repair, the old nucleotides are displaced by helicase enzymes.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Ap7t3NY1i8">A common type of DNA damage is a double-strand break, in which both strands of the DNA helix are broken. Double-strand breaks are caused by ionizing radiation, oxidative radicals, and other DNA-damaging agents. These types of breaks are particularly detrimental to the cell because they stall DNA replication and may lead to chromosome rearrangements, such as deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. There are two major pathways for repairing double-strand breaks: homology directed repair and nonhomologous end joining.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_pcgJgh11fG">Homology directed repair (also known as homologous recombination) repairs a broken DNA molecule by using the identical or nearly identical genetic information contained in another DNA molecule, usually a sister chromatid, the same mechanism employed in the process of homologous recombination that is responsible for crossing over (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_l3DG8meyw8" id="ben_9781319297145_9NBq8BnoMj">Chapter 12</a>). Homology directed repair begins with the removal of some nucleotides at the broken ends, followed by strand invasion, displacement, and replication (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JJVDfEqjgj" id="ben_9781319297145_Ppv8cIBa1h">Figure 12.20</a>). Many of the same enzymes that carry out crossing over are used in the repair of double-strand breaks by homology directed repair: two such enzymes are BRCA1 and BRCA2.

This pathway is often used when the cell is in G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_iulM1ju7xt">1</sub> and a sister chromatid is not available for repair through homology directed repair. Nonhomologous end joining uses proteins that recognize the broken ends of DNA, bind to the ends, and then join them together. Nonhomologous end joining is more error prone than homology directed repair and often leads to deletions, insertions, and translocations. A poorly understood alternative type of end joining is microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), which relies on very small (5–25 bp) homologies near the ends of broken DNA molecules to recognize the ends and rejoin them. Because the regions of homology are so short, this mechanism is also more error prone than homology directed repair. Nonhomologous end joining plays an important role in somatic recombination, a process that leads to the antibody diversity in the immune system (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_aq2batjj9S" id="ben_9781319297145_VPMWV16EyY">Chapter 22</a>).The most common DNA-repair mechanisms are summarized in <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_rKU5T16wqf"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FJJeMZedcG" id="ben_9781319297145_ixUXW1Wug5">Table 18.5</a></strong>.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xaFaTUOeBB">An example of a translesion DNA polymerase is polymerase η (eta), which bypasses pyrimidine dimers in eukaryotes. Polymerase η inserts AA opposite a pyrimidine dimer. This strategy seems to be reasonable because about two-thirds of pyrimidine dimers are thymine dimers. However, the insertion of AA opposite a CT dimer results in a C • G → T • A transversion. Polymerase η therefore tends to introduce mutations into the DNA sequence.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_RXRC8B38X5">Several human diseases are connected to defects in DNA repair. These diseases are often associated with high incidences of specific cancers because defects in DNA repair lead to increased rates of mutation. This phenomenon is discussed further in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qia1wFPBxu" id="ben_9781319297145_y4Hss892Ou">Chapter 23</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TbpQQe5Tg2">Among the best studied of the human DNA-repair diseases is xeroderma pigmentosum (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_S9cPdutUfg"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5JruNZrsOy" id="ben_9781319297145_ByGT632v3s">Figure 18.40</a></strong>), a rare autosomal recessive condition that includes abnormal skin pigmentation and acute sensitivity to sunlight. People who have this disease also have a strong predisposition to skin cancer, with an incidence ranging from 1000 to 2000 times that found in unaffected people. Sunlight includes a strong UV component, so exposure to sunlight produces pyrimidine dimers in the DNA of skin cells. Although human cells lack photolyase (the enzyme that repairs pyrimidine dimers in bacteria), most pyrimidine dimers in humans can be corrected by nucleotide-excision repair (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_RUEjuMS2cu" id="ben_9781319297145_B6oG0g8Bmu">Figure 18.39</a>). However, the cells of most people with xeroderma pigmentosum have defective nucleotide-excision repair, so many of their pyrimidine dimers go uncorrected and may lead to cancer.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fWEQcngCWC">Xeroderma pigmentosum can result from defects in several different genes. Some individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum have mutations in a gene encoding the protein that recognizes and binds to damaged DNA; others have mutations in a gene encoding helicase. Still others have defects in the genes whose products play a role in cutting the damaged strand on the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_NTYcLcsVbe">′</sup> or 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_C3SjmS99DO">′</sup> sides of the pyrimidine dimer.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8Eif1P51sZ">Another genetic disease caused by faulty DNA repair is an inherited form of colon cancer called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).
