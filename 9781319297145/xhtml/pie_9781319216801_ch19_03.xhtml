<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_uzuG6bxbJx">Often a first step in the molecular analysis of a DNA segment or gene is to isolate it from the remainder of the DNA so that further analyses can be carried out. In the sections that follow, we define recombinant DNA technology and consider three groups of molecular techniques that are used to cut DNA segments: restriction enzymes, engineered nucleases, and CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jeZsfaBHcT">Techniques for accurately and efficiently cleaving DNA helped to usher in the first major revolution in molecular genetics: the development of recombinant DNA technology. In 1973, a group of scientists produced the first organisms with recombinant DNA molecules. The group was led by Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of the San Francisco School of Medicine at the University of California. The scientists inserted a piece of DNA from one plasmid into another, creating an entirely new recombinant DNA molecule. They then introduced the recombinant plasmid into <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_d5rUFZtz28">Escherichia coli</i> cells. These experiments ushered in one of the most momentous revolutions in the history of science.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_aZc3ic4pdC">The sequences recognized by a restriction enzyme are located randomly within the genome. Accordingly, there is a relation between the length of the recognition sequence and the number of times it is present in a genome: there will be fewer longer recognition sequences than shorter ones, because the probability of the occurrence of a particular sequence consisting of, say, six specific bases is less than the probability of the occurrence of a particular sequence of four specific bases. Therefore, restriction enzymes that recognize longer sequences will cut a given piece of DNA into fewer and longer fragments than will restriction enzymes that recognize shorter sequences.</p>

CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are encoded by DNA sequences called Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR). A CRISPR array consists of a series of such palindromic sequences (sequences that read the same forward and backward on two complementary DNA strands) separated by unique spacers, which consist of sequences derived from bacteriophages or foreign plasmids (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xvhBv1Lzbi" id="ben_9781319297145_BZMyNqSEzr">Figure 14.23a</a>). When bacteriophage or plasmid DNA enters a prokaryotic cell, proteins cut up the foreign DNA and insert bits of it into a CRISPR array, which then serves as a memory of the invader.

The crRNAs combine with proteins called CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to form effector complexes. The Cas proteins have nuclease activity—the ability to cut DNA. If the same foreign DNA (the protospacer) enters the cell in the future, a CRISPR-Cas complex recognizes and attaches to it. The crRNA in the complex binds to its complementary sequence in the foreign DNA, and the Cas protein cleaves the foreign DNA, rendering it nonfunctional. In this way, CRISPR-Cas serves as an adaptive RNA defense system that remembers and destroys foreign invaders.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jAlf9ZMDwc">A variety of CRISPR-Cas systems have been found in different bacterial and archaeal species. Geneticists have engineered some of these systems to serve as molecular editing tools. The most widely used system is CRISPR-Cas9, derived from the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_yjEpP9gvXy">Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. This system naturally requires two RNA molecules, crRNA and another RNA molecule termed tracrRNA. These two RNAs pair and then combine with Cas9 to form an effector complex. To facilitate the use of this system in genome editing, researchers have engineered the crRNA and the tracrRNA into a single guide RNA (sgRNA) (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_gcwKblGDgH"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_BNFn1nmzRo" id="ben_9781319297145_GbDEfLJncy">Figure 19.3</a></strong>). A 20-nucleotide region of the sgRNA pairs with DNA, although the nucleotides within an 8–12-nucleotide “seed” sequence are most important in pairing. By altering the sequence of the sgRNA, it is possible to direct the action of the effector complex to any specific DNA sequence desired. This relatively long recognition sequence makes CRISPR-Cas9 much more specific than restriction enzymes, meaning that it can be directed to unique sites within the genome.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_aL6bxrJ4jD">An important feature of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is the required presence of a sequence in the target DNA (the DNA to be cleaved) called a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_BNFn1nmzRo" id="ben_9781319297145_bQqehMR84I">Figure 19.3</a>).

For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 PAM is estimated to occur, on average, about once every 8 bp in the human genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 effector complex first associates with a PAM, and then Cas9 unwinds the DNA nearby. This unwinding allows the sgRNA to pair with its complementary sequence in the DNA. Once the target DNA and sgRNA are paired, Cas9 makes double-stranded cuts in the DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_dDa4Wgd0zR">Once the DNA of a cell has been cleaved by CRISPR-Cas9, the cell immediately uses its DNA-repair mechanisms to try to repair the break. This feature provides a mechanism for editing the target sequence. There are two major pathways <span aria-label="576" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page576" role="doc-pagebreak" title="576"/>by which double-strand breaks are repaired within cells (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_COpHgno1B0" id="ben_9781319297145_KLDnfr6DOV">Section 18.5</a>). One, called nonhomologous end joining, joins together the two ends of DNA without using any template. The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be targeted to a specific gene; when that gene is cleaved by Cas9 and then repaired by nonhomologous end joining small insertions and deletions are introduced at the break site. This often produces frameshift mutations that disrupt the coding sequence and disable the gene (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_BNFn1nmzRo" id="ben_9781319297145_8xYxdfoIis">Figure 19.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sxhtIt3oaD">The other mechanism used by cells to repair double-strand breaks is homology directed repair (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_COpHgno1B0" id="ben_9781319297145_nOV64w0Fhf">Section 18.5</a>). This mechanism functions when a DNA template is provided for repairing the break. A researcher can provide a donor piece of double-stranded DNA that has ends complementary to the sequences at the ends of the break made by Cas9; homology directed repair may insert the donor DNA sequence into the break. In this way, researchers can selectively insert a desired sequence into a genome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_BNFn1nmzRo" id="ben_9781319297145_KTwqhfecqg">Figure 19.3</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_NsqSFrRPZk">An advantage of CRISPR-Cas9 over restriction enzymes is the relatively long nucleotide sequence recognized by the sgRNA, which allows researchers to produce unique cuts within genomic DNA. By changing the sequence of the sgRNA, precise edits can be made almost anywhere in the genome. Modifying the sgRNA to match a particular sequence in the genome is much simpler than trying to alter a DNA-binding protein, such as the proteins in zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs. Another important feature of CRISPR-Cas9 is the ability to use this technology in intact cells; mRNA for the Cas9 protein and specific sgRNAs can be introduced into many types of cells, where they are expressed and carry out their editing function. In a process known as multiplexing, it is possible to introduce several sgRNAs into a cell simultaneously and carry out multiple cuts in a single step.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iSnDahBzw2">CRISPR-Cas has great potential for genetic engineering and biotechnology. It can be applied to many different species, including species in which other methods of DNA manipulation have not worked well. It can be used to introduce new DNA sequences into whole animals and humans. For example, it is already being used to induce specific mutations in mice to create genetic models of human diseases, which can then serve as powerful research tools for the study of those diseases. CRISPR-Cas is also being developed as a tool for correcting genetic defects (gene therapy) and has the potential for treating infectious diseases by eliminating viral DNA from human cells. It will enable genetic modification of crops and domestic animals, in which it can be used to create very specific genetic alterations that benefit yield and produce characteristics that improve cultivation.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_oH1VsnMrBf">Researchers have developed a number of modifications of CRISPR-Cas systems to provide additional functions. For example, the Cas9 protein can be modified so that it makes single-stranded cuts in DNA, which are more likely to be repaired by homology directed repair and other precise DNA-repair mechanisms. Nucleases of other CRISPR systems are being used for different types of cutting. A Cas protein called Cpf1, which is used in some CRISPR systems, makes staggered cuts that produce complementary sticky ends like those produced by some restriction enzymes. The production of complementary sticky ends makes repair more accurate and enables the insertion of desired sequences with complementary sticky ends. Other CRISPR-Cas systems, called base editors, have been engineered to make single pair base substitutions in DNA and RNA, allowing precise changes to nucleotide sequences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_L7ualn4sbg">When a PAM for Cas9 is not available near a site where cleavage is desired, Cas proteins from different species that recognize different PAMs can be used. Variants of Cas9 have also been engineered that use different or more common PAM sequences. For example, one engineered variant of Cas9 recognizes the PAM sequence NG, which occurs more commonly than the usual NGG PAM recognized by Cas9.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_46vHcKDFkX">Modified CRISPR-Cas systems (with their cleavage function inactivated) have been developed for use as general RNA-guided devices for other functions. Transcription factors or chromatin-remodeling proteins can be tethered to an inactivated Cas to affect transcription at specific sites in the genome. For example, CRISPR-Cas has been modified to inhibit gene expression. Called CRISPR-mediated interference (CRISPRi), this system combines an inactive form of Cas protein fused to a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) protein domain (a zinc-finger binding domain; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch16_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8I3LsZrxyc" id="ben_9781319297145_woRv69bkIj">Table 16.1</a>), which inhibits transcription by producing chromatin modifications around transcription start sites. The sgRNA of CRISPRi targets this complex to a specific gene promoter, and the KRAB domain then inhibits the transcription of the gene. CRISPRi has been used to test the functional significance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_Na494tmROY">Chapter 14</a>). Researchers found that when expression of many of the lncRNAs was inhibited, cell growth was negatively affected, suggesting that the lncRNAs have important functions. Inactivated Cas proteins have also been coupled with proteins that stimulate transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_IFF5fSLUih">In another application, a CRISPR system called EvolvR targets an error-prone DNA polymerase to specific sites, where it synthesizes DNA with a high frequency of mutations, enabling the experimental study of evolution. CRISPR-Cas has also been adapted for use as a quick and efficient diagnostic tool for detecting viruses. For this function, researchers use a CRISPR-Cas system that attaches to specific viral DNA or RNA and cleaves it. The cleavage by this particular Cas protein then unleashes indiscriminate cleavage of nearby nonspecific single-stranded DNA that has been added and to which a fluorescent or other color tag has been attached. <span aria-label="577" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page577" role="doc-pagebreak" title="577"/>This produces a visual signal that the viral DNA is present. The components of this system have been applied to a strip of paper, which changes color when the viral DNA is detected, creating a diagnostic kit that provides a sensitive, rapid, and instrument-free method of detecting pathogens, all desirable properties for detecting viruses in remote areas. This method has been used in the detection of Zika virus, Dengue virus, and human papillomavirus (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sMlss9GGrV" id="ben_9781319297145_jGHdiWQzDL">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Mkkr2tCWcj">In another application, researchers have developed a system they call CRISPR-mediated analog multi-event recording apparatus (CAMERA), which uses CRISPR to create alterations in cellular DNA when a specific event occurs. The alterations can be used as a record of the events, such as changes in gene expression, alterations in environmental conditions, or development alterations leading to a specific cell’s lineages. These are just a few examples of the many ways that CRISPR-Cas has been modified and extended to provide a wide array of new molecular tools (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_YlrVOqjlPO"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sh2y5HDZOR" id="ben_9781319297145_XQB0AH3qqI">Table 19.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_33BaD7TtZH">A limitation in the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing is the potential for off-target cleavage. Some mismatches between the sgRNA and the complementary DNA sequence are tolerated by the Cas9 protein, so the system may cleave DNA at sites other than the desired target sequence. Unfortunately, off-target cleavage depends on many factors and varies among cell types, so predicting where and when cleavage will occur has been difficult. Much work has concentrated on engineering the sgRNA and Cas9 protein to be more selective in pairing and cutting, so as to reduce undesirable off-target cuts. For example, geneticists have produced a high-fidelity Cas9 by altering its amino acid sequence so that nonspecific interaction between the Cas protein and the DNA backbone is weakened, thereby forcing the nuclease to depend more on base pairing between the sgRNA and the DNA and increasing its specificity. These changes eliminated nearly all off-target cleavage by the high-fidelity Cas9.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_w7v5CJ4oWg">If CRISPR-Cas is applied to multicellular embryos or whole organisms, there is also the potential to create genetic mosaics (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Q3KCkaCVoA" id="ben_9781319297145_k6RITo4s7u">Section 6.2</a>). Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas is not 100% efficient, meaning that DNA in some cells is edited and DNA in other cells is not. It can therefore produce tissues in which different cells have different DNA sequences. The effects of this mosaicism could vary tremendously, depending on what genes are edited, what tissues are involved, and how efficient the editing is.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bZwct4Tt02">Another potential difficulty is getting the CRISPR-Cas components into a cell. This can often be done with cells in culture by transfection, in which cells are bathed in a solution containing DNA or mRNA encoding the Cas protein and the sgRNA and treated to make their membranes more permeable to foreign DNA. While transfection works in cell culture, getting the CRISPR-Cas components into intact organisms is more challenging. Sometimes the sgRNA and Cas protein are directly injected into fertilized egg cells, but most cells are too small for direct injection. Cas9 is a relatively large protein that does not easily pass across the cell membrane. Some other CRISPR-associated nucleases are smaller and easier to get into cells; these smaller nucleases are being exploited for use in delivery. Researchers have also delivered Cas enzyme to brain cells by coating the enzyme onto gold nanoparticles, which were then injected into the brain.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_R0cLZjzJTv">One concern about CRISPR-Cas9 technology is that its ease of use and potential to alter almost any DNA sequence might mean that it could be used to genetically modify humans in ethically questionable ways. Gene therapy—the genetic alteration of somatic cells to treat disease—has been carried out numerous times using non-CRISPR technology and is widely accepted by bioethicists (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fT10m8PJzz" id="ben_9781319297145_elQhqiIVGp">Section 19.7</a>). ethical concerns about CRISPR-Cas focus on the possibility of germ-line editing (in which genes in reproductive cells are altered) because the edited genes will be passed on to future generations, affecting the future gene pool of the species. In early 2015, a group of leading scientists and ethicists met in Napa, California, to discuss the scientific, legal, and ethical implications of genome editing using CRISPR-Cas technology. This group strongly discouraged all attempts at human germ-line modification until the implications of CRISPR-Cas editing could be discussed more widely by scientific and governmental organizations. <span aria-label="578" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page578" role="doc-pagebreak" title="578"/>The group encouraged transparent research, educational forums on the new technology, and the convening of representative developers and users to discuss its social, ethical, and scientific implications. Other groups have echoed many of these same recommendations. In spite of these concerns, the CRISPR-Cas system has been used to carry out genome editing in human embryos, including correcting a mutation that causes a heart condition, although in this case the treatment was carried out in vitro and the embryos were never allowed to complete development. In 2018, a Chinese researcher shocked the world by reporting that he had carried out gene alteration on human embryos, which were then allowed to develop and were born. The gene that was allegedly altered provided immunity to HIV, a disease that is preventable by other means. This work has been uniformly condemned as unethical by researchers and ethicists around the world.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FlMN30o5s0">In addition to ethical considerations, there are safety concerns about applying CRISPR-Cas to humans. Off-target cuts could induce mutations that might lead to cancer or other medical problems. Some researchers have pointed to the potential dangers of using CRISPR-Cas to edit animals and plants that are released into the wild.</p>

Repair of these cuts by nonhomologous end joining or homology directed repair provides the means to introduce alterations to the genome. This technology has been used in many organisms and cell types, and it has the potential for additional applications, but its use has raised a number of ethical concerns.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_vIqHoetnVB">We have now discussed several techniques for precisely cutting a DNA molecule. After cutting, it is often necessary to separate the resulting fragments and to verify that the DNA was altered in the expected fashion. Gel electrophoresis provides a way to separate and visualize DNA fragments.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8bXd748os6">Electrophoresis is a standard technique for separating molecules on the basis of their size and electrical charge. There are a number of different types of electrophoresis; to separate DNA molecules,

The DNA fragments migrate toward the positive end of the gel. During this migration, the porous gel acts as a sieve, separating the DNA fragments by size. Small DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do large ones, so over 1–2 hours, the fragments separate on the basis of their size. Typically, DNA fragments of known length (size standards) are placed in one of the wells. By comparing the migration distance of the unknown fragments with the distance traveled by the size standards, <span aria-label="579" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page579" role="doc-pagebreak" title="579"/>a researcher can determine the approximate size of the unknown fragments (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_w0rLCx6fyc"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ib7IUHeDt9" id="ben_9781319297145_Ihk0AvnfYi">Figure 19.4b</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3tauYx8Ox2">The DNA fragments are still too small to see, so the problem of visualizing them must be addressed. Visualization can be accomplished in several ways. The simplest procedure is to stain the gel with a dye specific for nucleic acids, such as ethidium bromide, which wedges itself tightly (intercalates) between the bases of DNA and fluoresces when exposed to UV light, producing brilliant bands on the gel (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_gSRMYOvsXd"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ib7IUHeDt9" id="ben_9781319297145_QDQrEzO4J8">Figure 19.4c</a></strong>). Alternatively, DNA fragments can be visualized by adding a label to the DNA before it is placed in the gel. For example, chemical labels can be detected by adding antibodies or other substances that carry a dye and will attach to the relevant DNA, which can then be visualized directly.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Iq50D19KF6">If a small piece of DNA, such as a plasmid, is cut by a restriction enzyme, the few fragments produced can be seen as distinct bands on an electrophoretic gel. In contrast, if genomic DNA from a cell is cut by a restriction enzyme, thousands of fragments of different sizes are produced. A restriction enzyme that recognizes a 4-base sequence would, theoretically, cut about once every 256 bp. The human genome, with 3.2 billion base pairs, would generate more than 12 million fragments when cut by this restriction enzyme. When separated by electrophoresis and stained, this large set of fragments would appear as a continuous smear on the gel because of the presence of so many fragments of differing sizes. Usually, researchers are interested in only a few of these fragments, perhaps those carrying a specific gene. How can they locate the desired fragments in such a large pool of DNA?</p>

The bases on the probe will pair only with the bases on a complementary sequence, so a suitably labeled probe can be used to locate a specific gene or an other DNA sequence. To use a probe, a researcher first cuts the DNA into fragments by using one or more restriction enzymes and then separates the fragments with gel electrophoresis. Next, the separated fragments must be denatured and transferred to a permanent solid medium (such as a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3hK8BLdcKC">After the single-stranded DNA fragments have been transferred, the membrane is placed in a hybridization solution containing a labeled probe. The probe binds to (hybridizes with) any DNA fragments on the membrane that bear complementary sequences. Often, a probe binds to only a part of a DNA fragment, so the DNA fragment may contain sequences not found in the probe. The membrane is then washed to remove any unbound probe; a biochemical method reveals the presence of the bound probe.</p>
