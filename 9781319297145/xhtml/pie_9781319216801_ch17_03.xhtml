<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_dtaZoarQhL">One type of gene control in eukaryotic cells is accomplished through the modification of chromatin structure. In the nucleus, histone proteins associate to form octamers, around which helical DNA tightly coils to create chromatin (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rqYt5m90Nt" id="ben_9781319297145_3DTn6GkQjd">Figure 11.4</a>). In a general sense, this chromatin structure itself represses gene expression. For a gene to be transcribed, proteins called transcription factors (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ap1bLYVbt4" id="ben_9781319297145_k1CoXcFl64">Section 17.3</a>) must bind to the DNA. Other regulator proteins and RNA polymerase must also bind to the DNA for transcription to take place. How can these proteins bind with DNA wrapped tightly around histone proteins? The answer is that before transcription, chromatin structure changes so that the DNA becomes more accessible to the transcription machinery.</p>

This relaxation of the chromatin structure allows regulatory proteins access to binding sites on the DNA. Indeed, many DNase I hypersensitive sites correspond to known binding sites for regulatory proteins. At least three different processes affect gene regulation by altering chromatin structure: (1) chromatin remodeling, (2) the modification of histone proteins, and (3) DNA methylation. Each of these mechanisms will be discussed in the sections that follow.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_WpINrMN6uQ">One of the best-studied examples of a chromatin-remodeling complex is SWI–SNF, which is found in yeast, humans, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tZVmqryv47">Drosophila</i>, and other eukaryotes.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xwIbzVAR2D">Evidence suggests at least two mechanisms by which chromatin-remodeling complexes reposition nucleosomes. <span aria-label="504" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page504" role="doc-pagebreak" title="504"/>First, some complexes cause the nucleosome to slide along the DNA, allowing DNA that was wrapped around the nucleosome to occupy a position in between nucleosomes, where it is more accessible to proteins affecting gene expression (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_I5pn8kLPyj" id="ben_9781319297145_eEKCBro2o6">Figure 17.1</a>). Second, some complexes cause conformational changes in the DNA, in nucleosomes, or in both so that DNA that is bound to the nucleosome assumes a more exposed configuration.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xlvoawjBwW">Chromatin-remodeling complexes are targeted to specific DNA sequences by transcription factors that attach to a complex and then bind to the promoters of specific genes. There is also evidence that chromatin-remodeling complexes work together with enzymes that alter histones, such as acetyltransferase enzymes (which we’ll describe shortly), to change chromatin structure and expose DNA for transcription.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5wHPVKhXly">The histones in the octamer core of a nucleosome have two domains: (1) a globular domain that associates with the other histones and the DNA, and (2) a positively charged tail domain that interacts with the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA. The tails of histone proteins are often modified by the addition or removal of phosphate groups, methyl groups, or acetyl groups. Another modification of histones is ubiquitination, in which a small molecule called ubiquitin is added to or removed from the histones. These modifications have sometimes been collectively called the

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_R8NNyIQaFm">One type of histone modification is the addition of methyl groups (CH<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_85MdfO5qzq">3</sub>) to the tails of histone proteins. These modifications can bring about either the activation or the repression of transcription, depending on which histone is modified and which particular amino acids in the histone tail are methylated. Enzymes called histone methyltransferases add methyl groups to specific amino acids (usually lysine or arginine) of histones. Other enzymes, called histone demethylases, remove methyl groups from histones. Many of the enzymes and proteins that modify histones, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases, do not bind to specific DNA sequences and must be recruited to specific chromatin sites. Sequence-specific binding proteins, preexisting histone modifications, and RNA molecules serve to recruit histone-modifying enzymes to specific sites.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9AOL7kJFKm">A common modification is the addition of three methyl groups to lysine 4 in the tail of the H3 histone protein, abbreviated H3K4me3 (K is the abbreviation for lysine). Histones containing the H3K4me3 modification are frequently found near promoters of transcriptionally active genes. Studies have identified proteins that recognize and bind to H3K4me3, including nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF). NURF and other proteins that recognize H3K4me3 have a common protein-binding domain that binds to the H3 histone tail and then alters chromatin packing, allowing transcription to take place. Research has also demonstrated that some transcription factors that are necessary for the initiation of transcription (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KBBmwjHUS4" id="ben_9781319297145_ysug1vzzeb">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ap1bLYVbt4" id="ben_9781319297145_mCnH05Cnms">Section 17.3</a>) bind directly to H3K4me3.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_iWSS4W4YHK">Another type of histone modification that affects chromatin structure is acetylation, the addition of acetyl groups (CH<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_bwS0cac3Tk">3</sub>CO) to histones. The acetylation of histones usually stimulates transcription. For example, the addition of a single acetyl group to lysine 16 in the tail of the H4 histone prevents the formation of the 30-nm chromatin fiber (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rqYt5m90Nt" id="ben_9781319297145_u6bBdmZy2C">Figure 11.4</a>), causing the chromatin to be in an open configuration that makes the DNA available for transcription.

Acetyl groups are added to histone proteins by acetyltransferase enzymes; other enzymes called deacetylases strip acetyl groups from histones and restore chromatin structure, which represses transcription.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yTUEgfWjkS">Our understanding of how changes in chromatin structure are associated with gene expression, and of how DNA-binding proteins affect transcription, has been greatly advanced by the use of a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This technique allows researchers to determine the locations within the genome where a specific protein interacts with DNA. ChIP has been used to determine the locations of histones that have undergone modifications as well as where transcription factors and other proteins bind to promoters and enhancers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lrF1Gfg2N1">The basic idea of ChIP is that a particular protein and the DNA to which it is bound are isolated, the protein and DNA are then separated, and the DNA sequence to which the <span aria-label="506" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page506" role="doc-pagebreak" title="506"/>protein was formerly bound is identified. The technique has provided a powerful means of determining the genome-wide locations of modified histones and the binding sites for transcription factors and other proteins that affect transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_o7X310sLI2">One version of ChIP, called crosslinked ChIP (XChIP), is used for identifying the binding sites of transcription factors and other proteins that bind to DNA. In this procedure (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lUFKJ0vrcQ" id="ben_9781319297145_iWkiKMiPEP"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_q9V8NaYqae">Figure 17.4</strong></a>), the protein and associated DNA are temporarily crosslinked, which means that they are treated with formaldehyde or UV light to create covalent bonds between the DNA and protein. The crosslinking holds the DNA and protein together so that the DNA to which the protein is bound can be isolated along with the protein. After crosslinking, the cell is lysed, and the chromatin is broken into pieces by digestion with an enzyme or by mechanical shearing. Antibodies specific for a particular protein—such as a specific transcription factor—are then applied. The antibodies attach to the protein–DNA complexes as well as to a solid substrate (usually small beads). These beads can then be used to precipitate the protein–DNA complexes. Next, the crosslinking is reversed, separating the DNA and the protein. The protein is removed by an enzyme that digests protein but not DNA, leaving fragments of the DNA to which the protein was bound.</p>

Three tiny oval structures are bound to D N A and are labeled D N A binding protein. Crosslink D N A and proteins enter the process. The tiny zig-zag shaped crosslink D N A binds to the D N A binding protein below. Cell lysis occurs and a slightly wavy D N A strand is obtained, with D N A binding proteins and crosslink D N A strands. Fragment the chromatin. The D N A strand is now divided into various fragments below. Add antibodies specific for D N A-binding protein and precipitate. The D N A fragments that are not bound by protein are eliminated and D N A fragments that are bound to protein are selected below. An antibody gets attached to each of these protein bound fragment. Separate D N A and protein. Digest protein. The antibodies and the D N A binding protein are eliminated. D N A fragments are obtained below. These D N A fragments are sequenced and a graph with overlapping peaks of varying heights is obtained below. The sequence obtained from left to right is as follows: T, C, T, G, G, T, G, T, T, G, A, A, G, A, G, C, A, G, A. Determine location in genome.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PIq1Xy4toV">The location of the resulting DNA fragments within the genome can then be determined by several different methods. One method, termed ChIP-Seq, determines the base sequences of the fragments using next-generation sequencing technologies (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_1Izf5JQq9i">Chapter 19</a>). When the chromatin is broken into pieces and subjected to immunoprecipitation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lUFKJ0vrcQ" id="ben_9781319297145_Et2lfvPBEa">Figure 17.4</a>), many short overlapping fragments of DNA are precipitated. Some of the sequences within each fragment are those that were covered by the protein; others are DNA on either side of the binding site. When the overlapping fragments are sequenced, the base pairs that were covered by the protein will be present in more copies and will be sequenced more often (resulting in more sequence reads) than base pairs that were not covered by the protein, producing peaks of sequence reads at those sites where the protein was bound. The locations of these peaks within the genome can be determined by comparing the sequences within the peaks with a reference genome sequence. The results provide information about the genomic locations of binding sites for the specific protein.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6VbeeFQJYQ">Another version of ChIP, called native ChIP (nChIP), does not use crosslinking. It is often used for finding the locations of modified histone proteins. In this case, crosslinking is not required because the DNA and the histones are naturally linked by the nucleosome structure. The chromatin is isolated from the cell and fragmented, and antibodies to a particular protein—usually a specific modified histone—are used to precipitate the protein–DNA complexes. <span aria-label="507" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page507" role="doc-pagebreak" title="507"/>The histones and DNA are separated, the histones are digested, and the DNA fragments to which the modified histones were attached are sequenced or otherwise identified.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QhRPlz8IC3">ChIP analysis has been used to determine the locations of modified histones that activate or repress transcription. As mentioned earlier, the H3K4me3 histone modification is associated with promoters of active genes. ChIP analysis has successfully identified locations of this modified histone in the human genome, helping identify active promoters in different tissues.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_WHybl8UnnS">The tails of histone proteins are often modified by the addition or removal of phosphate groups, methyl groups, or acetyl groups.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lj6iBfk6mf">Another change in chromatin structure associated with transcription is the methylation of cytosine bases, which yields 5-methylcytosine (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_A01ho8cxQd" id="ben_9781319297145_46lVNIzWAC">Figure 10.20</a>). The methylation of cytosine in DNA is distinct from the methylation of histone proteins mentioned earlier. Heavily methylated DNA is associated with the repression of transcription in vertebrates and plants, whereas transcriptionally active DNA is usually unmethylated in these organisms. Abnormal patterns of methylation are also associated with some types of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Cc1T7uJRpt">DNA methylation is most common on cytosine bases adjacent to guanine nucleotides (CpG, where p represents the phosphate group in the DNA backbone), so two methylated cytosines sit diagonally across from each other on opposite strands:</p>

While genes are not being transcribed, these CpG islands are often methylated, but the methyl groups are removed before the initiation of transcription. CpG methylation is also associated with long-term gene repression, such as that of the inactivated X chromosome of female mammals (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EWKADqCEc2" id="ben_9781319297145_19mGECgkSS">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_L0ZsQL1Nvk">An association exists between DNA methylation and the deacetylation of histones, both of which repress transcription. Certain proteins that bind tightly to methylated CpG sequences form complexes with other proteins that act as histone deacetylases. In other words, methylation attracts deacetylases, which remove acetyl groups from the histone tails, stabilizing the nucleosome structure and repressing transcription. Demethylation of DNA allows acetyltransferases to add acetyl groups, disrupting nucleosome structure and permitting transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_13O2Y5SCUK">Changes in chromatin structure that affect gene expression, such as the mechanisms just described (chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation), are examples of the phenomenon of epigenetics: alterations to DNA and chromatin structure that affect traits and are passed on to other cells or generations but are not caused by changes in the DNA base sequence.
