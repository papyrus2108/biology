<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3xES1a07g4">To investigate the inheritance of the white-eye trait in fruit flies, Morgan systematically carried out a series of genetic crosses.

These results suggested that white eyes are a simple recessive trait. When Morgan crossed the F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_m9oYPT6AUi">1</sub> flies with each other, however, he found that all the female F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_xiGoAD0lZj">2</sub> flies possessed red eyes, but half the male F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_184eaon7uN">2</sub> flies had red eyes and the other half had white eyes.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cITI9qF3Ph">To explain this unexpected result, Morgan proposed that the locus affecting eye color is on the X chromosome (i.e., that eye color is X linked). He also recognized that eye-color alleles are present on the X chromosome only; no homologous allele is present on the Y chromosome. Because the cells of females possess two X chromosomes, females can be homozygous or heterozygous for the eye-color alleles. The cells of males, on the other hand, possess only a single X chromosome and can carry only a single eye-color allele. Males, therefore, cannot be homozygous or heterozygous but are said to be

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PiG9Nw8q4y">To verify his hypothesis that the white-eye trait is X linked, Morgan conducted additional crosses. He predicted that a cross between a white-eyed female and a red-eyed male would produce all red-eyed females and all white-eyed males (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KH8UELEZfN" id="ben_9781319297145_qBSdS9POP5"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ZxqWMyb42T">Figure 4.12b</strong></a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_k4MBWUAaM4">When Morgan crossed his original white-eyed male with homozygous red-eyed females, all 1237 of the progeny had red eyes except for 3 white-eyed males. Morgan attributed these white-eyed F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_QUSdK9znoO">1</sub> males to the occurrence of further random mutations. However, flies with these unexpected phenotypes continued to appear in his crosses. Although uncommon, they appeared far too often to be due to spontaneous mutation. Calvin Bridges, who was one of Morgan’s students, set out to investigate the genetic basis of these exceptions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2o6t0itdai">Bridges found that the exceptions arose only in certain strains of white-eyed flies. When he crossed a white-eyed female from one of those strains with a red-eyed male, about 5% of the male offspring had red eyes and about 5% of the female offspring had white eyes. In this cross, the expected result is that every male fly should inherit its mother’s X chromosome and should have the genotype X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_VVVaB0qgmL"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_DQ1fxYBiIC">w</i></sup>Y and white eyes.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_wLxZxRQZPf">To further examine X-linked inheritance, let’s consider another X-linked characteristic: red–green color blindness in humans. The human eye perceives color through light-sensing cone cells that line the retina. Each cone cell contains one of three pigments capable of absorbing light of a particular wavelength: one absorbs blue light, a second absorbs red light, and a third absorbs green light. The human eye actually detects only three colors—blue, red, and green—but the brain mixes the signals from different cone cells to create the wide spectrum of colors that we perceive. Each of the three pigments is encoded by a separate locus; the locus for the blue pigment is found on chromosome 7, and those for the green and the red pigments lie close together on the X chromosome.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_a87PKHQnes">The most common types of human color blindness are caused by defects of the red and green pigments; we will refer to these conditions as red–green color blindness. Mutations that produce defective color vision are generally recessive, and because the genes encoding the red and the green pigments are located on the X chromosome, red–green color blindness is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. (See <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kh0AYDKt5S" id="ben_9781319297145_mQCEuKfT7o">Chapter 8</a> for additional information about the genes that cause red–green color blindness.)</p>

In contrast, females inherit an X chromosome from each parent; thus, all the female offspring of this cross will be heterozygous with normal color vision. A female is color blind only when she inherits color-blindness alleles from both parents, whereas a male need only inherit a color-blindness
allele from his mother to be color blind; for this reason, color blindness and most other rare X-linked recessive traits are more common in males than in females.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5muRsHsUOV">In these crosses for color blindness, notice that an affected woman passes the X-linked recessive trait to her sons but not to her daughters, whereas an affected man passes the trait to his grandsons through his daughters but never to his sons. X-linked recessive characteristics may therefore appear to alternate between the sexes, appearing in females in one generation and in males in the next generation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bXQAF0fyFC">Recall that the X and Y chromosomes pair in meiosis because they are homologous at the small pseudoautosomal regions. Genes in these regions of the X and Y chromosomes are homologous, just like those on autosomes, and they exhibit autosomal patterns of inheritance rather than the sex-linked inheritance seen for most genes on the X and Y chromosomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_H6PfY2y8OP">There are several different ways to record genotypes for X-linked characteristics. Sometimes these genotypes are written in the same way as those for autosomal characteristics. In this case, hemizygous males are simply given a single allele: for example, the genotype of a female <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_F7sD4p4Zso">Drosophila</i> with white eyes is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_FMTaEvJNaI">ww</i>, and the genotype of a white-eyed hemizygous male is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_JCOIQI0zTC">w</i>. Another method is to include the Y chromosome, designating it with a diagonal slash (/). With this method, the white-eyed female’s genotype is still <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_z2OEiTBe3F">ww</i>, and the white-eyed male’s genotype is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_m6oOsuNfb2">w</i>/. Perhaps the most useful method is to record the X and Y chromosomes in the genotype, designating the X-linked alleles with superscripts, as is done in this chapter. With this method, a white-eyed female is X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_TlyFGDSjnW"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Z5FpodyOrl">w</i></sup>X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_u4k4WcOAQV"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ukYrjO4Iyf">w</i></sup> and a white-eyed male is X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_ARrGfQ0yZP"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wynp8oA3j3">w</i></sup>Y.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_hDAoUx6yfo">Research on sex chromosomes has led to the conclusion that the X and Y chromosomes in many organisms evolved from a pair of autosomes. The first step in this evolutionary process took place when one member of a pair of autosomes acquired a gene that determines maleness, such as the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ulSYKelSQa">SRY</i> gene found in humans today (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_CdTEFSVuM3"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Xhg7rzQYia" id="ben_9781319297145_n4T03XRlia">Figure 4.16</a></strong>). This step took place in mammals about 250 million years ago. Any individual organism with a copy of the chromosome containing this gene then became male. Additional mutations occurred on the proto-Y chromosome, affecting traits that are beneficial only in males, such as sperm development. The genes that encode these types of traits are advantageous only if they are present in males. Natural selection favors the suppression of crossing over for most of the length of the X and Y chromosomes because this suppression prevents genes that encode male traits from appearing in females. Crossing over can still take place between the two X chromosomes in females, but there is little crossing over between the X and the Y chromosomes, except for the small pseudoautosomal regions in which the X and the Y chromosomes continue to pair in meiosis, as stated earlier.</p>

</aside>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_epO5JAxth2">For reasons that are beyond the scope of this discussion, the lack of crossing over led to (and continues to lead to) an accumulation of mutations on and a loss of genetic material from the Y chromosome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Xhg7rzQYia" id="ben_9781319297145_Z2Olad4PYN">Figure 4.16</a>). Over millions of years, the Y chromosome slowly degenerated, losing DNA and genes until it became greatly reduced in size and contained little genetic information. This degeneration produced the Y chromosome found in males today. Indeed, the Y chromosomes of humans and many other organisms are small and contain little genetic information; therefore, few characteristics exhibit Y-linked inheritance. Some researchers have predicted that the human Y chromosome will continue to lose genetic information in the future and will completely disappear from the species in about 10 million years, a disheartening prospect for those of us with a Y chromosome (and perhaps some of those with two Xs). However, new research suggests that decay of the human Y chromosome has come to a halt and that no genes have been lost in the last 6 million years. The genes that remain on the <span aria-label="96" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page96" role="doc-pagebreak" title="96"/>Y chromosome appear to be remarkably stable. Internal recombination within the Y chromosome (described in the next section) may have aided in slowing down or preventing the complete decay of the human Y chromosome.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_b6w7cgGuLA">The genetic sequence of most of the human Y chromosome was determined as part of the Human Genome Project (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_x2lFsh3p0R" id="ben_9781319297145_aoXIsXlNW0">Chapter 20</a>). This work revealed that about two-thirds of the Y chromosome consists of short DNA sequences that are repeated many times and contain no active genes. The other third consists of just a few genes. Only about 350 genes have been identified on the human Y chromosome, compared with thousands on most chromosomes, and only about half of those identified encode proteins. Some of the protein-encoding genes found on the Y chromosome have homologous genes on the X chromosome. The function of most Y-linked genes is poorly understood; many appear to influence male sexual development and fertility. Others play a role in gene regulation and protein stability. Some are expressed throughout the body, but many are expressed predominantly or exclusively in the testes. Although the Y chromosome has relatively few genes, research with <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XWSiorhSY9">Drosophila</i> suggests that it carries genetic elements that affect the expression of numerous genes on autosomes and X chromosomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_241cN3INdI">A surprising feature revealed by sequencing is the presence of eight massive palindromic sequences on the Y chromosome. A palindrome is a sentence or word, such as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7LnqoAeqO6">rotator</i>, that reads the same backward and forward.

</aside>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Pt4sJigKSi">Thus, a palindromic sequence in DNA appears twice, very much like the two copies of a DNA sequence that are found on two homologous chromosomes. And just as it does with homologous chromosomes, recombination can take place between the two palindromic sequences on the Y chromosome. As already mentioned, the X and the Y chromosomes are not homologous at most of their sequences, and most of the Y chromosome does not undergo crossing over with the X chromosome. This lack of interchromosomal recombination leads to an accumulation of deleterious mutations on the Y chromosome and the loss of genetic material. Evidence suggests that the two arms of the Y chromosome recombine with each other, which partly compensates for the absence of recombination between the X and the Y chromosomes. This internal recombination may help to maintain some sequences and functions of genes on the Y chromosome and prevent its total degeneration.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_dsvpRTsxPI">Although the palindromic sequences afford opportunities for recombination, which helps prevent the decay of the Y chromosome over evolutionary time, they occasionally have harmful effects. Recent research has revealed that recombination between the palindromes can lead to rearrangements of the Y chromosome that cause anomalies of sexual development. In some cases, recombination between the palindromes leads to deletion of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gmVv8Hkdu8">SRY</i> gene, producing an XY female. In other cases, recombination deletes other Y-chromosome genes that take part in sperm production. Sometimes recombination produces a Y chromosome with two centromeres; such a chromosome may break as the centromeres are pulled in opposite directions in mitosis. The broken Y chromosomes may be lost in mitosis, resulting in XO cells and Turner syndrome.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2VGpHlc86W">DNA sequences in the Y chromosome undergo mutation with the passage of time and thus vary among individual males. These mutations create variations in DNA sequence that, like Y-linked traits, are passed from father to son and can therefore be used as genetic markers to study male ancestry. Although the markers themselves do not encode any physical traits, they can be detected with the use of molecular methods. Mutations can readily accumulate in the Y chromosome because so much of it is nonfunctional. Many of these mutations are unique; they arise only once and are passed down through the generations. Individual males possessing the same set of mutations are therefore assumed to be related, and the distribution of these genetic markers on Y chromosomes provides clues about the genetic relationships of present-day people.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_K9EYn92emd"><span aria-label="97" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page97" role="doc-pagebreak" title="97"/>Y-linked genetic markers have been used to study the offspring of Thomas Jefferson, principal author of the Declaration of Independence and third president of the United States. In 1802, a political enemy accused Jefferson of fathering a child by his slave Sally Hemings, but the evidence was circumstantial. Hemings, who worked in the Jefferson household and accompanied Jefferson on a trip to Paris, had five children. Jefferson was accused of fathering the first child, but rumors about the paternity of the other children circulated as well. Descendants of Hemings’s children maintained that they were part of the Jefferson line, but some Jefferson descendants refused to recognize their claim.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_0dZmZ0YeHi">To resolve this long-standing controversy, geneticists examined markers from the Y chromosomes of male-line descendants of Hemings’s first son (Thomas Woodson), her last son (Eston Hemings), and a paternal uncle of Thomas Jefferson with whom Jefferson had Y chromosomes in common (descendants of Jefferson’s uncle were used because Jefferson himself had no verified male descendants). Geneticists determined that Jefferson possessed a rare and distinctive set of genetic markers on his Y chromosome. The same markers were also found on the Y chromosomes of the male-line descendants of Eston Hemings. The probability of such a match arising by chance is less than 1%. The markers were not found on the Y chromosomes of the descendants of Thomas Woodson. Together with the circumstantial historical evidence, these matching markers suggest that Jefferson (or a male-line relative of Jefferson) was the father of Eston Hemings but not Thomas Woodson.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_9CevsaZS4W">What features should we look for to identify a trait as sex linked? A common misconception is that any genetic characteristic in which the phenotypes of males and females differ must be sex linked. In fact, the expression of many <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_B6s0RUNcEP">autosomal</i> characteristics differs between males and females. The genes that encode these characteristics are the same in both sexes, but their expression is influenced by sex hormones. The different sex hormones of males and females cause the same genes to generate different phenotypes in males and females.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hfLoEbhUCX">Another misconception is that any characteristic that is found more frequently in one sex than in the other is sex linked. A number of autosomal traits are expressed more commonly in one sex than in the other. These traits are said to be sex-influenced. Some autosomal traits are expressed in only one sex; these traits are said to be sex-limited. Both sex-influenced and sex-limited characteristics will be considered in more detail in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1Cr0Us1Qbh" id="ben_9781319297145_xlimYWZpvJ">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cghZrWwPBq">Several features of sex-linked characteristics make them easy to recognize. Y-linked traits are found only in males, but observing a trait only in males does not guarantee that it is Y linked because some autosomal characteristics are expressed only in males. Y-linked traits are unique, however, in that <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0Yx1xurpqQ">all</i> the male offspring of an affected male express the father’s phenotype. Furthermore, a Y-linked trait can be inherited only from the father’s side of the family. Thus, a Y-linked trait can be inherited only from the paternal grandfather (the father’s father), never from the maternal grandfather (the mother’s father).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tEPHYQoFCu">X-linked characteristics also exhibit a distinctive pattern of inheritance. X linkage is a possible explanation when reciprocal crosses give different results. If a characteristic is X linked, a cross between an affected male and an unaffected female will not give the same results as a cross between an affected female and an unaffected male. For almost all autosomal characteristics, reciprocal crosses give the same result. We should not conclude, however, that when the reciprocal crosses give different results, the characteristic is necessarily X linked. Other sex-associated forms of inheritance, considered in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1Cr0Us1Qbh" id="ben_9781319297145_vXhudBylxi">Chapter 5</a>, also produce different results in reciprocal crosses. The key to recognizing X-linked inheritance is to remember that a male always inherits his X chromosome from his mother, not from his father. Thus, an X-linked characteristic is not passed directly from father to son; if a male clearly inherits a trait from his father—and his mother is not heterozygous—it cannot be X linked.</p>
