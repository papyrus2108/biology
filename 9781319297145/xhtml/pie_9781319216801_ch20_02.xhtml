An early step in characterizing a genome may be to prepare genetic and physical maps of its chromosomes. These maps provide information about the relative locations of genes, molecular markers, and chromosome segments, which can help in positioning chromosome segments and aligning stretches of sequenced DNA into a whole-genome sequence. These maps are also the foundation for positional cloning (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_htcV3RL7rL" id="ben_9781319297145_GjjyvTG6LH">Section 19.4</a>), in which genes that influence specific traits are located and sequenced.</p>

Maps are indispensable for finding a new friend’s house, the way to an unfamiliar city in your state, or the location of a country. Each of these examples requires a map with a different scale. To find a friend’s house, you would probably use a city street map or zoom in to a fine-scale city map that shows city streets; to find your way to an unknown city, you might pick up a state highway map or zoom out to a larger view that shows cities within a state; to find a country such as Kazakhstan, you would need a world atlas or an even larger-scale map that shows different countries. Similarly, navigating a genome requires maps of different types and scales.</p>

These maps are based on the genetic process of recombination (hence the name <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tqPm1KLJ0E">genetic map</i>). The basic principles of constructing genetic maps are discussed in detail in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_pnbkjQ3xot" id="ben_9781319297145_Jyp27MkskP">Chapter 7</a>. In short, individual organisms of known genotype are crossed, and the frequency of recombination between loci is determined by examining the progeny. If the recombination frequency between two loci is 50%, then the loci are found on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome. If the recombination frequency is less than 50%, the loci are found close together on the same chromosome (they belong to the same linkage group). For linked genes, the rate of recombination is proportional to the physical distance between the loci. Distances on genetic maps are measured in recombination frequencies (centiMorgans [cM] or map units [m.u.]). Data from multiple two-point or three-point crosses can be integrated into linkage maps of whole chromosomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2ltTJxAAvf">Genetic maps have several limitations, the first of which is resolution, or detail. The human genome includes 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA and has a total genetic distance of about 4000 cM, an average of 800,000 bp/cM. Even if at least one marker were present within each centiMorgan (which is unrealistic), their resolution in regard to the physical structure of the DNA would still be quite low. In other words, the detail of a genetic map is very limited. A second problem with genetic maps is that they do not always accurately correspond to physical distances between genes. Genetic maps are based on rates of crossing over, which vary somewhat from one part of a chromosome to another; therefore, the distances on a genetic map are approximations of real physical distances along a chromosome. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_AxuzBnwN0O"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_vaeWgrlZqV" id="ben_9781319297145_q4vpJwTCsh">Figure 20.2</a></strong> compares the genetic map of chromosome III of yeast with a physical map determined by DNA sequencing. There are some discrepancies in the distances between genes and even in the positions of some genes. In spite of these limitations, genetic maps have been critical to the development of physical maps and the sequencing of whole genomes.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rvciQ0WmjM">One of the techniques that has been used in the past for creating physical maps is restriction mapping, which determines the positions of restriction sites in DNA. When a piece of DNA is cut (digested) with a restriction enzyme and the fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis, the number of restriction sites in the DNA and the distances between them can be determined by the number and positions of bands on the gel (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ib7IUHeDt9" id="ben_9781319297145_QxAFtQg8H7">p. 578 in Chapter 19</a>). However, this information does not tell us the order or the precise locations of the restriction sites. To map restriction sites, a sample of the DNA is cut with one restriction enzyme, and another sample of the same DNA is cut with a different restriction enzyme. A third sample is cut with both restriction enzymes together (a double digest). The DNA fragments produced by these restriction digests are then separated by gel electrophoresis, and their sizes are compared. Overlap in the sizes of the fragments produced by the digests can be used to position the restriction sites on the original DNA molecule (see the Worked Problem at the end of this chapter). Most restriction mapping is done with several restriction enzymes, used alone and in various combinations, producing many restriction fragments. With long pieces of DNA (greater than 30 kb), computer programs are used to determine the restriction maps, and restriction mapping may be facilitated by labeling one end of a large DNA fragment with a chemical tag or by identifying the end with the use of a probe.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_SmMN2ykJ0i">Physical maps, such as restriction maps of DNA fragments or even whole chromosomes, were often used in the past for genomic analysis. These lengthy maps are created by combining maps of shorter, overlapping DNA fragments. A number of additional techniques exist for creating physical maps: determining the positions of short, unique sequences of DNA on a chromosome; in situ hybridization, by which markers can be visually mapped to locations on chromosomes; and DNA sequencing.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_dUOzkpeXhq">The ultimate goal of structural genomics is to determine the ordered nucleotide sequences of entire genomes of organisms, providing the sequence information that is used to answer other questions.

The main obstacle to sequencing a whole genome is the immense size of most genomes. Bacterial genomes are usually at least several million base pairs long; many eukaryotic genomes are billions of base pairs long and are distributed among dozens of chromosomes. Furthermore, for technical reasons, sequencing cannot begin at one end of a chromosome and continue straight through to the other end; only small fragments of DNA—typically 500 to 700 nucleotides—are usually sequenced at one time. Therefore, determining the sequence for an entire genome requires that the DNA be broken into thousands or millions of small overlapping fragments that can then be sequenced. The difficulty lies in putting these short sequences back together in the correct order. Two different approaches have been used to assemble the sequenced fragments into a complete genome: map-based sequencing and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Here we consider these two approaches in the context of the Human Genome Project, in which both approaches were used.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VpwZv8Atp8">The Human Genome Project officially began in October 1990. Initial efforts focused on developing new and automated methods for cloning and sequencing DNA and on generating detailed physical and genetic maps of the human genome. The effort was a public project consisting of international collaboration among the 20 research groups and hundreds of individual researchers who formed the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium.

The sequences of the small-insert clones are examined for overlap, which allows them to be correctly assembled to give the sequence of the large-insert clones. Enough overlapping small-insert clones are usually sequenced to ensure that the entire genome is sequenced several times. Finally, the whole genome is assembled by putting together the sequences of all overlapping contigs (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EYsI2mDh4B" id="ben_9781319297145_bXHm5Bd844">Figure 20.5</a>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_4Kmfrn3lMF">The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium used a map-based approach to sequencing the human genome. Many copies of the human genome were cut up into fragments of about 150,000 bp each, which were inserted into bacterial artificial chromosomes. Yeast artificial chromosomes and cosmids were used in early stages of the project but did not prove to be as stable as the BAC clones, although YAC clones were instrumental in putting together some of the larger contigs. Restriction fingerprints and other genetic markers were used to assemble the BAC clones into contigs, which were positioned on the chromosomes with the use of genetic markers and probes. The individual BAC clones were then sheared into smaller overlapping fragments and sequenced, and the whole genome was assembled by putting together the sequence of the BAC clones.</p>

In map-based sequencing, sequenced fragments are ordered into the final genome sequence with the use of genetic and physical maps. In whole-genome shotgun sequencing, the genome is assembled by means of overlap in the sequences of small fragments.</p>

The human genome sequence was declared completed in the spring of 2003, although some gaps still remain. For most chromosomes, the finished sequence is 99.999% accurate, with less than one base-pair error per 100,000 bp, an accuracy rate 10 times that of the initial goal.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8p5maMqizb">With the first human genome determined, sequencing additional human genomes is much easier. It is now possible to sequence an entire human genome in a few hours, and genomes from thousands of different people have now been sequenced. The cost of sequencing a complete human genome has also dropped dramatically and will continue to fall as sequencing technology improves.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Ij33mDAm7N">The availability of the complete sequence of the human genome is proving to be of great benefit. The sequence has provided tools for detecting and mapping genetic variants across the human genome, greatly facilitating gene mapping in humans. For example, as we will see shortly, several million sites at which people differ in a single nucleotide (called single-nucleotide polymorphisms) have now been identified, and these sites are being used in genome-wide association studies to locate genes that affect diseases and traits in humans. The sequence is also providing important information about development and many basic cellular processes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ffvtnJaCXR">Next-generation and third-generation sequencing techniques that allow rapid and inexpensive sequencing of genomic DNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_jLg8awdh1c" id="ben_9781319297145_i95ikQ2YXW">Section 19.5</a>) are being used to address fundamental questions in many areas. For example, the genomes of a number of cancer cells have now been completely sequenced and compared with the sequences of healthy cells from the same person, allowing complete determination of all the mutations that lead to tumor formation and cancer progression. It is now possible to sequence the genomes of single cells, providing information about somatic mutations and how, for example, cells within a tumor change over time. The complete genome of an unborn baby has been sequenced from fetal DNA isolated from its mother’s blood.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6DLnh4XgE4">Researchers have reported the analysis of genomes from over 2600 Icelanders, providing a spectacular picture of the genetic composition of a nation. The 1000 Genomes Project, completed in 2015, sequenced and compared the genomes of 2504 individuals from 26 populations in Africa, East Asia, Europe, South Asia, and the Americas, with the goal of detecting most of the common variations that exist in the human species. Sequencing of the complete genomes of parents and their children has allowed a direct estimate of mutation rates.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_dGM2mttby1">Genomes have been sequenced from DNA extracted from the fossils of long-extinct animals, such as a 700,000-year-old <span aria-label="623" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page623" role="doc-pagebreak" title="623"/>Pleistocene horse. DNA has been isolated and genomes sequenced from the bones of ancient humans, including Neanderthals and Denisovans (a little-known group of humans that appear to be closely related to Neanderthals; see introduction to <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xua4LZ2D44" id="ben_9781319297145_cnUht9Nlj6">Chapter 10</a>). Comparisons of the modern human genome with the genomes of these and other species are adding to our understanding of human evolution. For example, research now suggests that the genomes of Europeans and Asians consist of 1% to 4% Neanderthal DNA, which was transferred to modern humans when interbreeding took place between the two species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_acZLgc4ILT">Along with the many potential benefits of having complete human sequence information, there are concerns about it being misused. With the knowledge gained from genome sequencing, many more genes for diseases, disorders, and behavioral and physical traits have been identified, increasing the number of genetic tests that can be performed to make predictions about the future phenotype and health of a person. There is concern that information from genetic testing might be used to discriminate against people who are carriers of disease-causing genes or who might be at risk for some future disease. This matter has been addressed to some extent in the United States with the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_DGU4rO7Akt" id="ben_9781319297145_ltysecXDwq">Section 6.4</a>), which prohibits health insurers and employers from using genetic information to make decisions about health-insurance coverage and employment (although it does not apply to life, disability, or long-term care insurance). Questions also arise about who should have access to a person’s genome sequence. What about relatives, who have similar genomes and might also be at risk for some of the same diseases? There are also questions about the use of this information to select for specific traits in future offspring. All these concerns are legitimate and must be addressed if we are to use the information from genome sequencing responsibly.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_MjbpqRBIjc">As we have seen, the human genome sequence was determined first as rough drafts in 2000 and then in its “final” form in 2003. This sequence has been of immense importance in research, medicine, and biotechnology. However, geneticist Ken Weiss has argued that what people refer to as “the human genome” does not actually exist: there is not a single genome that represents the human species. What was determined by the Human Genome Project is a <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_owReIwWe5c">reference</i> genome, which was based on DNA donated from not one but several different individuals whose identities are kept confidential for ethical reasons. In reality, there are billions of human genomes; every person’s genome is likely to be unique, differing at least a little from every other person’s genome. At millions of nucleotide positions across the genome, people vary in the particular base that occurs; some people, for example, possess a T, whereas others possess a G. Some people even have extensive segments of DNA (called structural variants) that are missing, duplicated, or rearranged. Furthermore, we know that there is not even a single genome sequence for a person; research has demonstrated that individual cells within the same person vary in their DNA sequences due to somatic mutations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BZ704QW1Ma">It’s important to keep in mind that the official human reference genome is not the ancestral sequence for all humans, nor even the most common genome sequence among humans. Rather, it is an arbitrary sequence, based on the genetic idiosyncrasies of those individuals whose DNA was sequenced in the Human Genome Project. And even the reference genome keeps changing, as corrections and better sequences for problematic regions are obtained.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_q7RzkePNya">Among nonhuman species, especially in bacteria, the problem of a single reference genome becomes even more significant. In many bacteria, different strains of the same species not only harbor variation within genes but may even have different sets of genes. This has led to the concept of a <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gfktMHl2cR">pangenome</i>, defined as the entire set of genes possessed by all members of a particular species. As sequencing becomes easier and less expensive, researchers are focusing more effort on understanding the diversity that exists within genomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aD5RtAVgU3">Genome sequencing has identified a number of sites where humans differ in their genome sequences. Imagine that you are riding in an elevator with a random stranger. How much of your genome do you have in common with this person? Studies of variation in the human genome indicate that you and the stranger will be identical at about 99.9% of your DNA sequences (not including structural variations such as duplications, deletions, copy-number variants, and other types of variations; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kh0AYDKt5S" id="ben_9781319297145_QZrIosGtUe">Chapters 8</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_druJmSR46T" id="ben_9781319297145_UjuEgXFbFx">18</a>).

SNPs within a haplotype are physically linked and therefore tend to be inherited together. New haplotypes can arise through mutation or crossing over, which breaks up the particular set of SNPs in a haplotype. Because the rate of crossing over is proportional to the physical distance between genes, SNPs and other genetic variants that are located close together on a chromosome will be strongly associated as haplotypes. The nonrandom association between genetic variants within a haplotype is called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_NC6P0cM0Qf">linkage disequilibrium</i> (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_jhGDJ0po2V" id="ben_9781319297145_jymEKlg9rD">Section 7.3</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5T14dQXGBM">Because of their variability and widespread occurrence throughout the genome, SNPs are valuable as markers in linkage studies. When a SNP is physically close to a disease-causing locus, it will tend to be inherited along with the disease-causing allele. Therefore, people with the disease will tend to have different SNPs than healthy people. A comparison between SNP haplotypes in people with a disease and those in healthy people can reveal the presence of genes that affect the disease; because the disease gene and the SNP are closely linked, the location of the disease-causing gene can be determined from the locations of associated SNPs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_z8T1PSdYsL">An international effort, called the International HapMap Project, cataloged and mapped SNPs and other genetic variants that could be used to identify common haplotypes in human populations for use in linkage and family studies. The project cataloged a total of 4.6 million SNPs from human populations. These SNPs are spread over all 22 human autosomes, as well as the X and Y chromosomes. The study found alleles from most of the common SNPs in four ethnic groups (African, Japanese, Chinese, and European), although the frequencies of the alleles vary considerably among human populations. The greatest genetic diversity of SNPs is found within Africans, which is consistent with many other studies that suggest that humans first evolved in Africa.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Eo9ha7IWny">Data from the HapMap Project have been used to provide important information about the function and evolution of the human genome. For example, studies of linkage disequilibrium with the use of SNPs have determined that recombination does not take place randomly across the chromosomes; there are numerous recombination hotspots where more recombination takes place than expected merely by chance. The distribution of SNPs is also providing information about regions of the human genome that have evolved quickly in the recent past, providing clues to how humans have responded to natural selection.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_HATCoKgLja">Many common diseases are caused by complex interactions among multiple genes. The availability of SNPs has greatly facilitated the search for these genes. 
<dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="ben_9781319297145_EF76dFdnBA"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_glossary.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_yYWRXuxMto" id="ben_9781319297145_asgJzMHl2A" role="doc-glossref">Genome-wide association studies</a></dfn> use numerous SNPs scattered across the genome to find genes of interest. Soon after the completion of the first phase of the HapMap Project, researchers used its SNP data to conduct a genome-wide association study of age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness among the elderly. In this study, researchers genotyped 96 people with macular degeneration and 50 unaffected people for more than 100,000 SNPs that blanketed the genome. The study revealed a strong association between the disease and <span aria-label="625" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page625" role="doc-pagebreak" title="625"/>a gene on chromosome 1 that encodes complement factor H, which has a role in immune function. This finding suggests that macular degeneration might be treatable with drugs that affect complement proteins. Another study uncovered a major gene associated with Crohn disease, a common inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Other studies using genome-wide scans of SNPs have identified genes that contribute to heart disease, bone density, prostate cancer, diabetes, and many more medical conditions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_v4dmO7gHx5">In one application of SNPs for finding disease associations, researchers genotyped 17,000 people in the United Kingdom for 500,000 SNPs in 2007. They detected strong associations between 24 genes or chromosome segments and the incidence of seven common diseases: coronary artery disease, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, bipolar disorder, hypertension, and two types of diabetes. The importance of this study is its demonstration that genome-wide association studies using SNPs could successfully locate genes that contribute to complex diseases caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tm6G9tdK2a">Within the past few years, SNPs have been used in genome-wide association studies to successfully locate genes that influence many additional traits, such as height, body mass index, the age of puberty and menopause in women, variation in facial features, skin pigmentation, eye color, glaucoma, and even susceptibility to infectious diseases such as meningococcal disease and tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the genes identified often explain only a modest proportion of the genetic influence on the trait. For example, one huge genome-wide association study combined data from over 100,000 people in an attempt to locate genes encoding blood lipids that are involved in cardiovascular disease. Although the study identified 95 different loci associated with lipid traits, these genes corresponded to only 25%–30% of the total genetic variation in these traits.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Dxiu4OTKDb">The missing DNA sequences that encode the majority of the genetic variation in such traits—sometimes called the “dark matter of the genome”—have thus far remained largely undetected. The low percentage of variation explained by most current genome-wide association studies means that the genes identified are not, by themselves, useful predictors of the risk of inheriting the disease or trait. Nevertheless, the identification of specific genes that influence a disease or trait can lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that produce the phenotype.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ttkGkevsE1">After a genome has been sequenced, one of the first tasks is to identify potential genes within the sequence. Unfortunately, there are no universal characteristics that mark the beginning and end of a gene. The enormous amount of DNA in a genome and the complexities of gene structure make finding genes within a sequence a difficult task. Computer programs have been developed to look for specific sequences in DNA that are associated with certain genes. There are two general approaches to finding genes. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ooqlAXFOFl">ab initio</i> approach scans the sequence, looking for features that are usually found within a gene. For example, protein-encoding genes are characterized by an open reading frame, which includes a start codon and a stop codon in the same reading frame. Specific sequences mark the splice sites at the beginnings and ends of introns; other specific sequences are present in promoters immediately upstream of start codons. The comparative approach looks for similarity between a new sequence and the sequences of all known genes. If a match is found, then the new sequence is assumed to be a similar gene. Some of these computer programs are capable of examining databases of protein sequences to see if there is evidence that a potential gene is expressed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qXhr9mbpYP">It is important to note that the programs that have been developed to identify genes on the basis of DNA sequence are not perfect. Therefore, the numbers of genes reported in most genome-sequencing projects are estimates. <span aria-label="626" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page626" role="doc-pagebreak" title="626"/>The presence of multiple introns, alternative splicing, multiple copies of some genes, and much noncoding DNA between genes makes accurate identification and counting of genes difficult.</p>

Computer programs are available for determining whether similar sequences have already been found, either in the same species or in different species. The most widely used of these programs is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). To conduct a BLAST search, a researcher submits a query sequence, and the program searches the database for any other sequences that have regions of high similarity to the query sequence. The program returns all sequences in the database that are similar, along with information about the degree of similarity and the significance of the match (how likely the similarity would be to occur by chance alone).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Nev19bTMX2">Additional databases contain information on sequence diversity: how and where a genome varies among individual organisms. The human genome has now been mapped for millions of SNPs, and information about the frequency of these variants in different populations is being collected. Additional databases have been developed to catalog all known mutations causing particular diseases; the Human Variome Project is an effort to collect and make available all genetic variations that affect human health.

It provides the ability to address <span aria-label="627" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page627" role="doc-pagebreak" title="627"/>two important issues: (1) the identification and study of microbes that cannot be cultured in the laboratory and (2) the study of the community structure of microorganisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NI1CbcLGoF">Traditionally, bacteria have been studied by growing and analyzing them in the laboratory. However, many bacteria cannot be cultured with the use of laboratory techniques. Metagenomics analyzes microbial communities by extracting DNA from the environment, determining its sequences, and reconstructing community composition and function on the basis of those sequences. This technique allows the identification and genetic analysis of species that cannot be grown in the laboratory and have never been studied by traditional microbiological methods. The entire genomes of some dominant species have been reconstructed from environmental samples, providing scientists with a great deal of information on the biology of these microbes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PllHgRNkY2">An early metagenomic study analyzed the microbial community found in acid drainage from a mine and determined that this community consisted of only a few dominant bacterial species.

Scientists collected ocean samples and used metagenomic methods to determine the microbial communities they contained. In this study, scientists catalogued sequences for more than 6 million proteins, including more than 1700 new protein families. Some important results have already emerged from metagenomic studies. Analyses of bacterial genomes found in ocean samples led to the discovery of proteorhodopsin proteins, which are light-driven proton pumps. Subsequent research demonstrated that these proteins are found in diverse microbial groups and are a major source of energy flux in the world’s oceans.</p>

The microbiome of a typical person probably includes as many bacterial cells as—or perhaps even more than—the number of human cells, although the number of bacteria will clearly vary from one person to the next. The National Microbiome Initiative, unveiled in 2016, is a project to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of microbiomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_1NFM2vGn0w">Research is demonstrating that the human microbiome plays an important role in human health. One study examined the gut microflora of obese and lean people. Two groups of bacteria are common in the human gut: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Researchers discovered that obese people have relatively more Firmicutes than do lean people and that the proportion of Firmicutes decreases in obese people who lose weight on a low-calorie diet. These same results were observed in obese and lean mice. In an elegant experiment, researchers transferred bacteria from obese to lean mice. Lean mice that received bacteria from obese mice extracted more calories from their food and stored more fat, suggesting that gut microflora might play some role in obesity.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pJjFe8LsPX">Ecological communities have traditionally been characterized on the basis of the species they contain. Metagenomics affords the possibility of characterizing communities on the basis of their component genes, an approach that has been termed gene-centric. A gene-centric approach leads to new questions: Are certain types of genes more common in some communities than others? Are some genes essential for energy flow and nutrient recycling within a community? Because of the larger sizes of their genomes, eukaryotic communities have not yet been the focus of these approaches, but many researchers predict that they will be in the future.</p>

They started with 1000 pieces of DNA that were synthesized in the laboratory and joined them together in successively larger pieces until they had assembled a complete copy of the genome. Within their synthetic genome, they included a set of DNA sequences that spelled out—in code—an email address, the names of the researchers who participated in the project, and several well-known quotations. Finally, the researchers transplanted the artificial genome into a cell of a different bacterial species, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PihLMgf7ml">Mycoplasma. capricolum</i>, whose original genome had been removed. The new cell then began expressing the traits specified by the synthetic genome.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_r5VvleeNve">Synthetic biology has also been extended to eukaryotic cells. In 2014, geneticists created a synthetic chromosome that successfully replaced a natural chromosome in yeast cells. By 2017, six artificial yeast chromosomes had been constructed, constituting almost 30% of the total yeast <span aria-label="628" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page628" role="doc-pagebreak" title="628"/>genome, and efforts are currently underway to engineer an entirely synthetic yeast genome. Another effort, called the Human Genome Project-Write (HGP-Write), has been proposed for synthesizing an entire human genome from scratch. However, current technologies are not capable of synthesizing such a large synthetic genome, and the idea has been controversial.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3vp5jlG1oK">These types of experiments have raised a number of concerns. The ability to tailor-make novel genomes, and to mix and match parts from different organisms, creates the potential for the synthesis of dangerous microbes that might create ecological havoc if they escaped from the laboratory or that could be used in biological warfare or bioterrorism. Creating a synthetic human genome has raised concerns that such efforts might be used to artificially enhance human traits. Ongoing discussions among geneticists, ethicists, security experts, and politicians are addressing these concerns and whether synthetic genomes can be safely made and used.</p>
