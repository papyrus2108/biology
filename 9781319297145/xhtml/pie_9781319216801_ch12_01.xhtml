<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_YL8wwoqhGM">When Ryan was born, it was immediately clear that he was special. Not only was he small for his gestational age, he also possessed small ears and had no kneecaps. A genetic specialist quickly recognized that Ryan exhibited a rare and peculiar genetic condition known as Meier-Gorlin syndrome, which results from a flaw in DNA replication.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UvZUd7URxu">Each eukaryotic chromosome contains an immense amount of DNA. A typical human chromosome consists of a single DNA molecule that is over a hundred million base pairs (bp) long. One of the challenges that eukaryotic cells face is copying this immense amount of genetic information whenever a cell divides. The process of eukaryotic replication takes place at breakneck speed—up to 5000 bp of DNA is copied every minute—but because of the immense size of eukaryotic chromosomes, replicating a typical human chromosome from a single starting point would require a week or more. Cells copy their DNA much more rapidly, often within minutes or hours. How is this accomplished?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9Mgkq5aWIW">The rapid replication in eukaryotic cells is achieved because replication does not initiate at a single point (which is what happens in bacteria) but instead starts at thousands of replication origins simultaneously. The use of many origins allows the entire eukaryotic genome to be replicated in a timely manner but creates another problem: how to ensure that the genome is precisely replicated once and only once per cell cycle, so that no genes go unreplicated and none are replicated multiple times. How does a cell ensure that replication at thousands of origins is initiated precisely only once per cell cycle?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QaMOJTbMcX">This precise copying of eukaryotic DNA is accomplished by separating the initiation of replication into two distinct steps. In the first step, the origins are <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TN3AKb8oRF">licensed</i>—approved for replication. This step takes place during the G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_ZhgLXM4nG1">1</sub> stage of the cell cycle, when licensing factors attach to each origin. In the second step, the replication machinery initiates replication at each licensed origin during the S stage. The key to this process is that the replication machinery functions only at licensed origins and that licensing occurs early in the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_O38jvjiKKT">The importance of proper replication licensing is illustrated by children who have Meier-Gorlin syndrome. These children experience a reduction in growth during prenatal development. Consequently, they are born small and continue to grow slowly as children, ending up with short stature. Other traits include missing or undeveloped kneecaps and small ears. Many experience difficulty feeding in infancy and childhood but have normal intellectual ability and life span.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vHf9bVjgaO">Meier-Gorlin syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition; most children with the disorder are born to parents who are heterozygous carriers and do not have the condition. When scientists examined the genomes of children with this condition, they discovered that most have mutations in one of several genes that code for a multiprotein complex called the origin-replication complex, which serves to initiate replication by binding to replication origins and licensing them for replication. In children with Meier-Gorlin syndrome, the origin-replication complex is defective. This impairment most likely slows down cell division and results in growth retardation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wlFCx9uBrx">DNA replication, essential to all life, is a highly complex process in which dozens of proteins, enzymes, and DNA structures ensure that DNA is copied accurately and quickly. As illustrated by the Meier-Gorlin syndrome, defects in a single component of this system can disrupt the entire process and have major consequences.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_7o0p4AaOfg">Defects in initiation of replication presumably slow down DNA synthesis and cell division, resulting in the growth reduction seen in children with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. However, most children with Meier-Gorlin syndrome also have small ears and missing kneecaps. How might flaws in replication initiation cause some body parts to be affected and not others? Can you propose some possibilities?</li>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_1IxhbLE03C">This chapter focuses on DNA replication, the process by which a cell doubles its DNA before division. We begin with the basic mechanism of replication that emerged from the DNA structure discovered by Watson and Crick. We then examine several different modes of replication, the requirements of replication, and the universal direction of DNA synthesis. We also examine the enzymes and proteins that participate in the process. Finally, we consider the molecular details of recombination, which is closely related to replication and is essential for the segregation of homologous chromosomes, the production of genetic variation, and DNA repair.</p>
