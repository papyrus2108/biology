<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_epcYJvLFug">Viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages for short) have played a central role in genetic research since the late 1940s. They are ideal for many types of genetic research because they have small and easily manageable genomes, reproduce rapidly, and produce large numbers of progeny. Bacteriophages have two alternative life cycles: the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_MjKhFTUQDV">lytic</i> cycle and the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_OMgo84NsyS">lysogenic</i> cycle. In the lytic cycle, a phage attaches to a receptor on the bacterial cell wall and injects its DNA into the cell (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8y4unXltri" id="ben_9781319297145_sBp93PlWlI"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_7r1mxpR4pn">Figure 9.19</strong></a>). Inside the host cell, the host DNA is degraded, and phage DNA is replicated, transcribed, and translated, producing more phage DNA and phage proteins. New phage particles are assembled from these components. The phages then produce an enzyme that breaks open the host cell, releasing the new phages.

The host cell has a gray circular chromosome and the phage has a purple double stranded chromosome. The cycles are connected in the middle because they share stages 1 and 2, where the phage binds and enters the host cell. The lytic cycle starts when a phage having phage D N A attaches to bacterial cell containing host D N A. The phage D N A enters the cell. The captions read, 1, The phage binds to the bacterium. 2, The phage D N A enters the host cell. From this point, the phage can either remain in the lytic cycle or can enter lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cycle on the left side, the host D N A is lysed and a caption reads, The host D N A is digested. The next picture shows multiple phage D N A and host D N A fragments and a caption reads, Phage D N A replicates. The next picture of bacterial cell shows phage D N A with phage proteins and then these are assembled and the bacterial cell is lysed. The captions read, Assembly of new phages is complete. A phage-encoded enzyme causes the cell to lyse. New phages are released to start the cycle again. From step 2 in the lytic cycle where phage D N A enters the host cell, the phage can enter a lysogenic cycle. A picture of host cell shows a bacterial chromosome with phage D N A incorporated. A caption reads, The phage D N A integrates into the bacterial chromosome and becomes a prophage. The next picture shows two bacterial cells with phage D N A incorporated into their genome. A caption reads, The prophage is replicated as part of the bacterial chromosome. This replication can continue through many cell divisions. The next picture shows host cell with bacterial chromosome and a separate phage D N A. A caption reads, The prophage may separate and the cell will enter the lytic cycle.</p>

The prophage is replicated along with the bacterial DNA and is passed on when the bacterium divides. While the prophage is integrated into the bacterial chromosome, it inhibits subsequent infection by the same type of phage.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_rfHPYEClJY">Viruses reproduce only within host cells, so bacteriophages must be cultured in bacterial cells. Phages can be grown in large liquid cultures of bacteria to generate large numbers of offspring, but to study the characteristics of individual phages, we must isolate them on petri plates. To do so, we can mix phages and bacteria together and plate them on a solid medium. A high concentration of bacteria is used so that the colonies will grow into one another and produce a continuous layer of bacteria, or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nYa4QBC3ZS">lawn</i>, on the agar. As the bacteria grow, an individual phage infects a single bacterial cell and goes through its lytic cycle. Many new phages are released from the lysed cell and infect additional cells, and the cycle is repeated. Because the bacteria are growing on a solid medium, the diffusion of the phages is restricted, so only nearby cells are infected. After several rounds of phage reproduction, a clear patch of lysed cells, called a

The illustration below has a methods and a results section. In the methods section, there is a picture of a phage with purple linear D N A and a phage with red linear D N A. One of them is r superscript negative and h superscript positive, and the other phage has the opposite genotype, r superscript positive h superscript negative. A caption reads, An E coli cell was infected with 2 different strains of T 2 phage. Both the phages infect a bacterial cell and inject their D N A into the same cell. The phage D N A recombines inside the host cell. Two captions read as follows: Crossing over between the 2 viral chromosomes produced recombinant progeny, h superscript positive r superscript positive and h superscript negative r superscript negative and Some viral chromosomes did not cross over, resulting in non-recombinant progeny. Arrows beneath the bacterial cell show 4 different combinations of genes assembled into phage genomes followed by a text as follows: 1, h superscript positive r superscript negative, non-recombinant phage produces cloudy, large plaques; 2, h superscript positive r superscript positive, recombinant phage produces cloudy, small plaques; 3, h superscript negative r superscript negative, recombinant phage produces clear, large plaques; and 4, h superscript negative r superscript positive, non-recombinant phage produces clear, small plaques. Below this, an image of bacteria in a petri plate with different types of plaques. A caption reads, Progeny phages were then plated on a mixture of E coli B and E coli B over 2 cells, which allowed all four genotypes of progeny to be identified. In the results section below, is a table showing the number of plaques of each phage genotype and designation. The table has 3 columns and 4 rows. The column headers are as follows: Genotype, plaques, and designation. For genotype h superscript negative r superscript positive, there are 42 plaques. For genotype h superscript positive r superscript negative, there are 34 plaques. Designation for both is parental progeny 76 percent. For genotype h superscript positive r superscript positive, there are 12 plaques. For genotype h superscript negative r superscript negative, there are 12 plaques. Designation for both is recombinant progeny 24 percent. A formula for calculating the R F, is given below: R F equals start fraction recombinant plaques over total plaques end fraction equals start fraction left parenthesis h superscript positive r superscript positive right parenthesis plus left parenthesis h superscript negative r superscript negative right parenthesis over total plaques end fraction. A caption reads, The percentage of recombinant progeny allowed the h superscript negative and r superscript negative mutants to be mapped.

Viruses also infect protists, fungi, plants, humans, and other animals, and some are important pathogens in these organisms. About 263 different viruses are known to infect humans, although there are undoubtedly many that have not been characterized. What we have learned about bacteriophages has important implications for the study of viruses that infect these complex organisms.</p>

Two copies of single-stranded R N A molecule is present with reverse transcriptase on it. R N A is enclosed within an octahedral viral protein coat, also known as capsid.

The illustration starts with a retrovirus docking on a cell receptor of a bacterial cell and then fusing with the cell. The first caption reads, Virus attaches to host cell at receptors in the membrane. Viral R N A with reverse transcriptase enzyme and viral proteins enters the host cell. The proteins are labeled viral proteins degrade. The second caption reads, The viral core enters the host cell. Reverse transcriptase on R N A makes c D N A strand complementary to the R N A. The third caption reads, Viral R N A uses reverse transcriptase to make complementary D N A, and viral R N A degrades. From this c D N A, a second complementary strand is formed. The fourth caption reads, Reverse transcriptase synthesizes the second D N A strand. This D N A now enters the host nucleus and incorporates itself within the host D N A. Transcription occurs and viral R N A is produced. This R N A leaves the nucleus and produces viral protein in the cell through translation. Assembly of virus takes place and a new virus is produced. The next captions read as follows: The viral D N A enters the nucleus and is integrated into the host chromosome, forming a provirus. On activation, proviral D N A is transcribed into viral R N A, which is exported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the viral R N A is translated. Viral R N A, proteins, new capsids, and envelopes are assembled. An assembled virus buds from the cell membrane.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8N8Pp0E7Yd">An example of a retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although research now indicates that HIV entered the United States around 1970 and was <span aria-label="280" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page280" role="doc-pagebreak" title="280"/>present in Africa much earlier, AIDS was not recognized as a disease until 1982, when a number of homosexual males in the United States began to exhibit symptoms of a new immune-system-deficiency disease. In that year, Robert Gallo proposed that AIDS was caused by a retrovirus; eventually, research by Gallo, Luc Montagnier, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, Jay Levy, and others identified HIV as the causative agent of AIDS. Between 1983 and 1984, as the AIDS epidemic became widespread, the HIV retrovirus was isolated from people with the disease. AIDS is now known to be caused by two different immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, which together have infected more than 70 million people worldwide since the beginning of the epidemic. Of those infected, 35 million have died. At the end of 2017, there were almost 37 million people around the globe living with HIV, including 2 million children. Most cases of AIDS are caused by HIV-1, which now has a global distribution; HIV-2 is found primarily in western Africa.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FZgIbYAQNL">HIV illustrates the importance of genetic recombination in viral evolution. Studies of the DNA sequences of HIV and other retroviruses reveal that HIV-1 is closely related to the simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees (SIV<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_MjZsYDvHqq">cpz</sub>). Many wild chimpanzees in Africa are infected with SIV<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_ubljEahngI">cpz</sub>, although it doesn’t cause AIDS-like symptoms in these animals.

Several independent transfers of SIV<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_mBxuehbweQ">cpz</sub> to humans gave rise to different groups (strains) of HIV-1.

The M group of HIV-1 has spread throughout the world and is responsible for most cases of HIV worldwide. The O group has infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa. Groups N and P have infected only a small number of people in Africa. HIV-2 evolved from a different retrovirus, SIV<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_8l7ZVRu8AR">sm</sub>, found in sooty mangabeys.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_MqkitLIgHD">Influenza demonstrates how rapidly changes in a pathogen can arise through recombination of its genetic material. Influenza, commonly called flu, is a respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. In the United States, from 5% to 20% of the population is infected with influenza annually, and though most cases are mild, an estimated 36,000 people die from influenza-related causes each year. At certain times, particularly when new strains of influenza virus enter the human population, there are worldwide epidemics (called pandemics); for example, in 1918, the Spanish flu virus killed an estimated 20 million to 100 million people worldwide.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_B8QFDLBPVw">Influenza viruses are RNA viruses that infect birds and mammals. The three main types are influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. Most cases of the common flu are caused by influenza A and B. Influenza A is divided into subtypes on the basis of two proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), found on the surface of the virus. The HA and NA proteins affect the ability of the virus to enter host cells and the host organism’s immune response to infection. There are 16 types of HA and 9 types of NA, which can exist in a virus in different combinations. For example, common subtypes of influenza A circulating in humans today are H1N1 and H3N2 (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Kqtrfhtn7r"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Q9xw32cTDy" id="ben_9781319297145_YfpBgVMYDI">Table 9.5</a></strong>), along with several types of influenza B.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kDn6RRXcAV">Although the influenza virus is an RNA virus, it is not a retrovirus: its genome is not copied into DNA and incorporated into a host chromosome. The influenza viral genome consists of seven or eight pieces of RNA enclosed in a viral envelope. Each piece of RNA encodes one or two of the virus’s proteins. The virus enters a host cell by attaching to specific receptors on the cell membrane. After the viral particle has entered the cell, the viral RNA is released, copied, and translated into viral proteins. Viral RNA molecules and viral proteins are then assembled into new viral particles, which exit the cell and infect additional cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_my8t3UA4uW">One of the dangers of the influenza virus is that it evolves rapidly, so that new strains appear frequently. The virus evolves in two ways. First, the enzyme that copies the viral RNA is especially prone to making mistakes, so new mutations are continually introduced into the genome of each viral strain. This type of continual change is called

Reassortment may take place when a host is simultaneously infected with two different strains. When the RNAs of both strains are replicated within the cell, RNA segments from two different strains may be incorporated into the same viral particle, creating a new strain. For example, in 2002, reassortment occurred between the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, creating a new H1N2 strain that contained the HA from H1N1 and the NA from H3N2. New strains produced by antigenic shift are responsible for most pandemics because no one has immunity to the radically different virus that is produced.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_KWlYYdfrZU">Birds harbor the most different strains of influenza A, but humans are not easily infected with bird influenza. New strains in humans are thought to arise most often from viruses that reassort in pigs, which can be infected by viruses from both humans and birds. In 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza (called swine flu) emerged in Mexico and quickly spread throughout the world. This virus arose from a series of reassortment events that combined gene sequences from human, bird, and pig influenza viruses (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JZvOLgDZQh" id="ben_9781319297145_T4q8TubXre"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_RxszMHQvIJ">Figure 9.28</strong></a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_BGE8AmxRqv">Rhinoviruses are very small RNA viruses that infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and are responsible for respiratory infections, including the common cold. <span aria-label="283" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page283" role="doc-pagebreak" title="283"/>Although the symptoms of rhinovirus infections are usually mild, they constitute a serious public health burden: colds force many people to miss work, make millions of people miserable, and occasionally lead to medical complications, such as pneumonia or exacerbation of asthma and cystic fibrosis. Respiratory infections caused by rhinoviruses remain resistant to treatment, even in the era of modern medicine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ClfzZor9zO">Rhinoviruses have a genome of single-stranded RNA, consisting of approximately 7200 nucleotides, that encodes only 11 proteins. Rhinoviruses have considerable genetic diversity and evolve rapidly. These viruses have a high mutation rate, caused by the inability of their RNA polymerase enzymes (which copy the RNA genome of the virus) to detect and correct mistakes made during the copying process. In addition, multiple viral strains may simultaneously infect the same cell and recombine, leading to the emergence of new rhinovirus strains.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7WmnCQz6BV">Rhinoviruses that cause colds in humans are highly specialized and are adapted to the human ecosystem. Curiously, they evolved from enteroviruses—viruses that inhabit the gut and can cause acute intestinal infections. Research suggests that rhinoviruses evolved long ago and are adapted to replicate and spread between human cells efficiently without killing their host, leading to relatively mild effects on the humans they infect. Genetic analysis demonstrates that there are three species of human rhinoviruses, called rhinovirus A, rhinovirus B, and rhinovirus C. Within each species, there are numerous variants, called serotypes. Recombination within and between species constantly generates new types of rhinoviruses.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_m0P55cNlWS">Zika virus is an RNA flavivirus, a group that includes a number of viruses that cause human disease, including West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Zika virus has recently spread rapidly around the world and is transmitted to humans by <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TvMUcqEtiR">Aedes</i> mosquitoes. Outbreaks of Zika virus in Brazil during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro focused worldwide attention on the disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_O8IvZzyG6x">Infection with Zika virus usually causes mild or no symptoms but can lead to several neurological conditions, including microcephaly (small head) in newborns. The virus was isolated in 1947 from a monkey in Africa and was found in humans in 1952, but prior to 2007, only a few cases of Zika virus infection were recorded. Major epidemics occurred in the Pacific Islands in 2013. In 2015, epidemics of Zika virus infection erupted in Brazil and then spread to other parts of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and North America. Although transmitted primarily by mosquito vectors, the virus is present in human body fluids and can be transmitted sexually.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_nN0dsL2mX3">The Zika virus genome consists of one single-stranded RNA molecule consisting of about 10,800 nucleotides. It contains a single gene, which is translated and processed into 10 different proteins. A characteristic of Zika virus is a high rate of recombination within its genome, which is uncommon in other flaviviruses and has perhaps contributed to its rapid spread around the globe. The virus has undergone multiple recombination events since it was first discovered. Zika virus undergoes rapid evolution, and a number of different strains have evolved.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7QEFmANGo7">Our understanding of Zika origin and spread has been greatly facilitated by studies that have isolated, sequenced, and analyzed the genomes of Zika viruses from around the world. For example, studies of Zika genomes indicate that the virus first evolved into two different lineages, one from Africa and another from Asia. Based on the number of genetic differences between them, researchers have estimated that the African and Asian strains diverged sometime in the seventeenth century. The outbreaks in the Pacific Islands and the Americas emerged from the Asian lineage. Genetic analysis demonstrated that hundreds of infections in Florida originated from at least 4 and perhaps as many as 40 separate introductions, mostly from countries and territories in the Caribbean.</p>
