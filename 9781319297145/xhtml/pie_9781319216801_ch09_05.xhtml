<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jK6Kv4sg2w">As discussed earlier, we live in a microbial world. Bacteria and archaea are found in almost every conceivable environment, often in very large numbers, and thrive where other organisms perish. In spite of their abundance, being a microbe is not easy. Bacteria and archaea face significant challenges, the most serious of which are viruses. Scientists have estimated that there are ten times as many viruses as bacteria and archaea, so viruses are a constant threat. Not surprisingly, bacteria and archaea have evolved a number of mechanisms to prevent the entry and reproduction of viruses and other forms invading DNA.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_4qAV7rVh3j"><span aria-label="272" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page272" role="doc-pagebreak" title="272"/>To invade a cell, a virus must first attach to the cell wall or membrane and inject its DNA or RNA into the cell. Many bacteria and archaea have evolved mechanisms to prevent viral attachment and injection of the viral DNA or RNA into the cell. Some bacteria turn off the expression of receptors to which viruses attach; other bacteria secrete polysaccharide coats that limit the access of viruses to those receptors. Bacteria can also produce proteins on the cell membrane that prevent viruses from injecting their nucleic acids into the cell. In other cases, a bacterium that has been infected self-destructs, so that the virus within it is unable to replicate and spread to other bacteria. Other defense mechanisms block virus replication.</p>

Bacteria produce enzymes called restriction endonucleases that recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA at specific nucleotide sequences (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_4NTQOYYX6e">Chapter 19</a>). These enzymes cut up viral DNA, destroying the viral genome before it can replicate. Bacteria protect their own DNA from cleavage by modifying the recognition sequences on their DNA, usually by the addition of methyl groups. Restriction enzymes have been extensively used by geneticists in genetic engineering (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_xyT39s38l4">Chapter 19</a>).</p>

These have been compared to the immune systems of vertebrates in that they recognize and “remember” DNA from specific pathogens. CRISPR-Cas systems combine small RNA molecules known as CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) with Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins to provide defense against specific foreign DNA molecules originating from viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements. CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread in prokaryotes, occurring in 50% of bacterial species and 87% of archaea.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rMxh3Ggoq3">Bacteria and archaea have evolved a diverse set of CRISPR-Cas systems; these are divided into two major classes, 6 types, and 19 subtypes. These different CRISPR-Cas systems vary in the details of their components and mechanisms. In spite of these differences, all CRISPR-Cas systems have two major components: (1) a DNA sequence called the CRISPR array and (2) a set of genes encoding Cas proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jmW01B0AAR">The action of a CRISPR-Cas system takes place in three stages: adaptation, expression, and interference. Adaptation (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1jd1kkDC1F" id="ben_9781319297145_eGlZl6jNBL">Figure 9.17a</a>) occurs when foreign DNA from a virus, plasmid, or other element enters the cells. The foreign DNA is identified and cleaved by Cas proteins into fragments called protospacers. The protospacers are then processed and incorporated into the CRISPR array as spacers, which serve as a memory of the foreign DNA and can trigger the CRISPR-Cas reaction if the foreign DNA ever enters the cell again. New spacers are preferentially integrated at the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_DzxLRIFnHQ">′</sup> end of the CRISPR array, where they enhance immunity against recent invaders.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lMriBRvnkg">In the second stage—expression—the CRISPR array is transcribed into a long CRISPR precursor RNA (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1jd1kkDC1F" id="ben_9781319297145_Xwnx6Z0yl1"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_TUtbkjpLJT">Figure 9.17b</strong></a>), which is then cleaved by Cas proteins and processed into crRNAs, each of which contains a spacer sequence that is homologous to the foreign DNA. The crRNA combines with a Cas protein to form an effector complex.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vdtk61PCY4">Interference, the final stage of the process, occurs when foreign DNA from the same bacteriophage or plasmid enters the cell again. The effector complex binds to the foreign DNA through base pairing between the crRNA and the foreign DNA sequence. The Cas protein cleaves the foreign DNA, which is then degraded (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1jd1kkDC1F" id="ben_9781319297145_bv2VnHMzer"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_hGBfw1SPxS">Figure 9.17c</strong></a>). In this way, CRISPR-Cas serves as an adaptive defense system against foreign invaders. Because the bacterial cell carries the inserted pieces of foreign DNA in its own chromosome, it can “remember” previously encountered pathogens and quickly destroy their DNA. When bacterial cells divide, they pass on their CRISPR array to progeny cells, so the acquired immunity becomes inherited by future generations of bacteria.</p>

During interference, the CRISPR-Cas effector complex first associates with a PAM and then unwinds the DNA nearby. The requirement of a PAM for interference solves a dilemma that bacteria face in the use of CRISPR-Cas: how to recognize and cleave foreign DNA without destroying the spacer DNA within its own CRISPR array. To solve this dilemma, many bacteria species have evolved the requirement of an adjacent PAM. Although a PAM is adjacent to the protospacer in the foreign DNA, the PAM sequences themselves are not integrated into the CRISPR array as part of the spacer. In this way, the CRISPR-Cas system cleaves foreign DNA (which has a PAM) but avoids cleaving DNA in the CRISPR array of the bacterial genome (where PAM is absent).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4bz0oLA9xE">As we have seen, bacteria have evolved a number of mechanisms to avoid infection by and reproduction of viruses, but viruses have, in turn, evolved countermeasures to avoid bacterial defenses. This has generated an evolutionary “arms race,” in which bacteria and phages are constantly changing in response to evolutionary changes in each other.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_42XmesjSHL">One way that viruses can avoid CRISPR-Cas immunity in bacteria is by constantly mutating their sequences so that the bacteria cannot recognize viruses that have previously infected the cell. Viral mutations that are effective in avoiding detection by CRISPR-Cas often occur in the PAM sequence or in the part of the protospacer recognized by the CRISPR-Cas effector complex. In addition, some viruses have evolved small proteins called anti-CRISPRs, which directly interfere with the CRISPR-Cas machinery.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_s9JcZxKat3">CRISPR-Cas systems are found in many bacteria, but they are missing from almost 50% of all bacterial species. Why do many bacterial species lack what appears to be a very effective defense against viruses and other foreign DNA? One possibility is that other defense mechanisms are sufficiently effective that CRISPR-Cas immunity provides no additional advantage. There are also likely to be significant costs to having CRISPR-Cas immunity. It may limit the ability of bacteria to take up potentially beneficial DNA that might provide antibiotic resistance or other adaptive traits. It is possible that CRISPR-Cas may sometimes erroneously attack the bacteria’s own DNA, creating a type of autoimmunity that disrupts normal function. And there are energetic costs to maintaining the CRISPR-Cas system. All of these factors may make it too costly for some bacteria to evolve CRISPR-Cas immunity.</p>
