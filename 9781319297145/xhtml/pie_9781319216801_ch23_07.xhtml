<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4VLkR7VJ7j">Many of the viruses that cause cancer in animals are retroviruses. In <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2NV3AY3MA4" id="ben_9781319297145_V9j5IlyQO4">Section 23.2</a>, we saw how studies of the Rous sarcoma retrovirus in chickens led to the identification of oncogenes in humans. Retroviruses sometimes cause cancer by mutating or rearranging host genes, converting proto-oncogenes into oncogenes (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_xnZ1GI9kFi"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_yaEoPNo2DW" id="ben_9781319297145_3IkQ2lPt3N">Figure 23.14a</a></strong>). Another way in which viruses can contribute to cancer is by altering the expression of host genes (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_wlPWqw7kNq"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_yaEoPNo2DW" id="ben_9781319297145_9bySAhwjeJ">Figure 23.14b</a></strong>). Retroviruses often contain strong promoters to ensure that their own genetic material is transcribed by the host cell. If the provirus inserts near a proto-oncogene, viral promoters can stimulate high levels of expression of the proto-oncogene, leading to cell proliferation.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5GwyB6Hgue">Part “a” shows a cell being infected with a retrovirus. The cell shows viral R N A inside which forms viral D N A through reverse transcription and incorporates into the host chromosome. The host chromosome shows two parts provirus and proto-oncogene. A caption reads, “A retrovirus inserts its R N A into the cell; the viral R N A undergoes reverse transcription and inserts into the host chromosome next to a proto-oncogene.” Viral reproduction occurs then and new viruses exit the host cell after its lysis. A caption reads, “When the virus reproduces, the proto-oncogene is incorporated into the virus.” After repeated rounds of infection and reproduction, another virus infects a host cell. The host chromosome from this cell has provirus and oncogene with mutation. A caption reads, “In repeated rounds of viral infection and reproduction, the proto-oncogene becomes rearranged or mutated or both, producing an oncogene that is inserted back into the host chromosome.” Part “b” again shows a cell being infected with a retrovirus. The cell shows viral R N A inside which forms viral D N A through reverse transcription and incorporates into the host chromosome. A caption reads, “A retrovirus infects a cell and the provirus inserts near a proto-oncogene.” This time the host chromosome has a provirus, strong-viral promoter, and proto-oncogene. Over-expression of proto-oncogene produces an m R N A. A caption reads, “The strong viral promoter stimulates overexpression of the proto-oncogene.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EMi1buYjlF">There are only a few retroviruses that cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1, the first human retrovirus discovered, is associated with human adult T-cell leukemia. Other human cancers are associated with DNA viruses, which, like retroviruses, integrate into the host chromosome but, unlike retroviruses, do not use reverse transcription.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_bHigueVNXP">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus that causes warts and other types of benign tumors of epithelial cells. More than 100 different types of HPV are known, about 30 of which are sexually transmitted and cause genital warts. A few of them are associated with cervical cancer. In the United States, 70% of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV-16 and HPV-18. One way that HPVs cause cancer is by producing proteins that attach to and inactivate the protein products of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fiX9BkALJ8">RB</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xOPjDuwkZk">p53</i>. As we have seen, the proteins encoded by these two genes play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle. When these proteins are inactivated, cells are stimulated to progress through the cell cycle and divide <span aria-label="725" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page725" role="doc-pagebreak" title="725"/>without the normal controls that prevent cell proliferation. Human papillomaviruses can also stimulate cancer by causing high expression of growth-promoting proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_IFifj5b5dd">Most sexually active women and men in the United States are infected with HPV, but only a small number of women with HPV will ever develop cervical cancer. The risk of infection by HPV can be reduced by limiting the number of sexual partners and by a vaccine that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for women in 2006 and for men in 2009. This vaccine is highly effective against four of the most common HPVs associated with cervical cancer. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that all boys and girls aged 11 or 12 years be vaccinated. A national survey conducted in the United States in 2014 reported that 60% of girls aged 13–17 years had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but only 42% of boys aged 13–17 years had received at least one dose. About 40% of girls and 22% of boys received all three of the recommended doses of the HPV vaccine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hkmNWTzVz8">In spite of the large number of women infected with HPV, the incidence of cervical cancer in the United States has declined 75% in the past 40 years. The primary reason for this decline is widespread use of the Pap test, which detects early stages of cervical cancer as well as cervical dysplasia, a precancerous growth that can be removed before it develops into cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_q2bHfXrycz">Although rare in the United States, cervical cancer is the second-most common cause of cancer in women worldwide, with high incidences in many developing countries, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South and Central America. An estimated 510,000 women throughout the world develop cervical cancer each year, and 288,000 die from the disease. The primary reason for the high incidence and death rate in developing regions is lack of access to cervical-cancer screening procedures, such as the Pap test. Making the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer available in these regions could greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.</p>
