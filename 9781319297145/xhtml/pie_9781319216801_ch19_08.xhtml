<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_HKdodH2OoO">In addition to providing valuable new information about the nature and function of genes, molecular genetic techniques have many practical applications, including the production of pharmaceutical products and other chemicals, specialized bacteria, agriculturally important plants, and genetically engineered farm animals. These techniques are also used extensively in medical testing and are even being used to correct human genetic defects. Hundreds of companies now specialize in developing products through genetic engineering, and many large multinational corporations have invested enormous sums of money in molecular genetic research. As discussed earlier, DNA analysis is also used in criminal investigations and for the identification of human remains.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zqTsS8F7T4">The first commercial products to be developed with the use of genetic engineering were pharmaceutical products used in the treatment of human diseases and disorders. In 1979, Eli Lilly and Company began selling human insulin produced with the use of recombinant DNA technology. The gene for human insulin was inserted into plasmids and transferred to bacteria, which then produced human insulin. Previously, diabetes was treated with insulin isolated from pig and cow pancreases; a few patients developed allergic reactions to this foreign protein. Insulin produced by recombinant bacteria has the advantage of being the same as that produced in the human body. Other pharmaceutical products produced through recombinant DNA technology include human growth hormone (for children with growth deficiencies) and <span aria-label="603" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page603" role="doc-pagebreak" title="603"/>tissue plasminogen activator (used to dissolve blood clots in heart-attack patients).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zZ02Qab2ZM">Bacteria play important roles in many industrial processes, including the production of ethanol from plant material, the leaching of minerals from ore, and the treatment of sewage and other wastes. The bacteria used in these processes have been modified by genetic engineering so that they work more efficiently. New strains of bacteria are being developed that will break down toxic chemicals and pollutants, enhance oil recovery, increase nitrogen uptake by plants, and inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_VJ4hJRW5rD">Recombinant DNA technology has had a major effect on agriculture, where it is now used to create crop plants and domestic animals with valuable traits. For example, plant pathologists had recognized for many years that plants infected with mild strains of viruses are resistant to infection by virulent strains. Using this knowledge, geneticists created plants with resistance to viruses by transferring genes for viral proteins to the plant cells. A genetically engineered squash, called Freedom II, carries genes from the watermelon mosaic virus 2 and the zucchini yellow mosaic virus, which protect the squash against viral infections. In 2017, the Arctic apple was introduced, a genetically modified apple that does not brown upon exposure to air.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Eoe6mnl2LY">Another objective has been to genetically engineer pest resistance into plants to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides. As discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_QGfxf25G43" id="ben_9781319297145_7qiIzOULJa">Section 19.3</a>, a gene from the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Ajvlzmhwoz">B. thuringiensis</i> that produces an insecticidal toxin has been transferred into corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cotton, and other plants. These Bt crops are now grown worldwide. Other genes that confer resistance to viruses and herbicides have been introduced into a number of crop plants; resistance to herbicides allows growers to use herbicides for weed control without harming the crops. During 2017, over 17 million farmers worldwide planted 190 million hectares of genetically engineered crops. In the United States, 92% of all corn, 94% of all cotton, and 94% of all soybeans grown in 2018 were genetically engineered.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_58uhMXTECm">Recombinant DNA technology is also being applied to domestic animals. The first animal to be genetically modified for food production in the United States—a rapidly growing salmon—was approved for commercial use in 2015. These salmon carry a foreign growth-hormone gene and promoter; the transgenic fish grow year-round instead of just during warm months, reaching market size more quickly and with less feed than wild salmon.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_AnefN51Vhu">Transgenic animals are also being developed to carry genes that encode pharmaceutical products. Some eukaryotic proteins must be modified after translation, and only other eukaryotes (not bacteria) are capable of carrying out the modifications. For example, a gene for human clotting factor VIII was attached to the regulatory region of the sheep gene for <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wKVQCUts7A">β</i>-lactoglobulin, a milk protein. The fused gene was injected into sheep embryos, creating transgenic sheep that produced the human clotting factor, which is used to treat hemophilia, in their milk. And through genetic engineering, scientists have created transgenic chickens that express a small RNA that blocks infection by avian influenza virus.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FoeMtyvAvb">Highly efficient gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas systems and TALENs will increasingly be used to precisely edit the genomes of domestic plants and animals. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to create transgenic wheat that is resistant to powdery mildew, a fungus that infects wheat. Because of its ease of use and low cost, CRISPR-Cas could be applied to less widely used specialty crops and animals, potentially widening the use of genetically modified organisms. The ability to make very precise genetic changes with CRISPR-Cas, however, makes these alterations difficult to detect and track once they are made, raising questions about the labeling of products as genetically modified.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vQJWaNFP74">The genetic engineering of agricultural products is controversial. One area of concern focuses on the potential effects of releasing novel organisms produced by genetic engineering into the environment. There are many examples in which nonnative organisms released into a new environment have caused ecological disruption because they are free of their predators and other natural control mechanisms. Genetic engineering normally transfers only short sequences of DNA, which are small relative to the genetic differences that often exist between species, but even small genetic differences may alter ecologically important traits that might affect the ecosystem.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VWOtCUMefs">Another area of concern is the effect of genetically engineered crops on biodiversity. In the largest field test of genetically engineered plants ever conducted, scientists cultivated beets, corn, and rapeseed that were genetically engineered to resist herbicide along with traditional crops on 200 test plots throughout the United Kingdom. They then measured the biodiversity of native plants and animals in the plots. They found that the genetically engineered plants were highly successful in suppressing weeds; however, plots with genetically engineered beets and rapeseed had significantly fewer insects that feed on weeds. For example, plots with genetically engineered rapeseed had 24% fewer butterflies than did plots with traditional crops.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_307BhMJ1mP">There is also concern that transgenic organisms may hybridize with native organisms and transfer their genetically engineered traits. For example, herbicide resistance engineered into crop plants might be transferred to weeds, which would then be resistant to the herbicides that are now used for their control. Some studies have detected hybridization between genetically engineered crops and wild populations of plants. For example, evidence suggests that transgenic rapeseed (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_90ZFygAzgo">Brassica napus</i>) has hybridized <span aria-label="604" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page604" role="doc-pagebreak" title="604"/>with the weed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PeUCfj9kJ8">Brassica rapa</i> in Canada. Other concerns focus on health-safety matters associated with the presence of engineered products in natural foods. Some critics have advocated required labeling of all genetically engineered foods that contain transgenic DNA or protein. Such labeling is required in countries of the European Union and will be required for some genetically modified foods in the United States starting in 2020.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lRVDI4iHfY">On the other hand, the use of genetically engineered crops and domestic animals has potential benefits. It is predicted that the world’s total crop production will need to increase by as much as 10% to meet the needs of an increased population, while at the same time climate change is predicted to lower crop yields in some areas. Genetically engineered plants with increased yields and the ability to grow in currently unfavorable conditions may help to meet this future need. Genetically engineered crops that are pest resistant have the potential to reduce the use of environmentally harmful chemicals, and research findings indicate that lower amounts of pesticides are being used in the United States as a result of the adoption of transgenic plants. Studies conducted in China show that when Bt crops are used, farmers spray less chemical insecticide, allowing more predatory insects to survive and provide natural pest control. Transgenic crops also increase yields, providing more food per acre, which reduces the amount of land that must be used for agriculture. Genetically engineered plants offer the potential for the greater yields that may be necessary to feed the world’s future population.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_DL68iVHMBV">The identification and cloning of many important disease-causing human genes have allowed the development of probes for detecting disease-causing mutations. Prenatal testing is already available for many genetic disorders (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_DGU4rO7Akt" id="ben_9781319297145_C9Cw3LDPgn">Section 6.4</a>). Additionally, presymptomatic genetic tests for adults and children are available for an increasing number of disorders. Some genetic tests are now being offered directly to consumers, without requiring the participation of a health-care provider. These direct-to-consumer genetic tests are potentially available for many genetic conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has limited the sale of direct-to-consumer genetic tests for medical conditions, and today, only a few such medical tests are available in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qlpCVx2aRA">The growing availability of genetic tests raises a number of ethical and social questions. For example, is it ethical to test for genetic diseases for which there is no cure or treatment? Other ethical and legal questions concern the confidentiality of test results. Who should have access to the results of genetic testing? Should relatives who also might be at risk be informed of the results of genetic testing?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_a9d7eUN6EI">Another set of concerns is related to the accuracy of genetic tests. For many genetic diseases, the only predictive tests available are those that identify a <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_URYUuru7D3">predisposing</i> mutation in DNA, but many genetic diseases can be caused by dozens or hundreds of different mutations. Probes that detect common mutations can be developed, but they will fail to detect rare mutations and may give a false negative result. Short of sequencing the entire gene—which is often too expensive—there is no way to identify all predisposed people. These questions and concerns are currently the focus of intense debate by ethicists, physicians, scientists, and patients.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UgaRlmCC38">In spite of the growing number of clinical trials for gene therapy, significant problems remain in transferring foreign genes into human cells, getting them expressed, and limiting immune responses to the gene products and the vectors used to transfer the genes. There are also concerns about the safety of gene therapy. In 1999, a patient participating in a gene-therapy trial had a fatal immune reaction after he was injected with a viral vector carrying a gene to treat his metabolic disorder. In addition, five children who underwent gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency disease developed leukemia that appeared to be directly related to the insertion of the retroviral vector into cancer-causing genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_snL1NMOV0e">Despite these setbacks, gene-therapy research has moved ahead, and gene therapy has been used to treat a number of diseases, often with successful outcomes for the patients. Recent clinical trials include the use of gene therapy to treat hemophilia (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TnCspasvqI" id="ben_9781319297145_ohx56MV6cL">Chapter 6</a>) by transferring a functional gene for clotting factor into patients using an adeno-associated virus. In another case, gene therapy was used to treat a child with epidermolysis bullosa, a devastating genetic skin disorder, by transferring a corrected copy of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kfMtCZupzt">LAMB3</i> gene to the patient’s skin cells, grown in culture, and then grafting the <span aria-label="605" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page605" role="doc-pagebreak" title="605"/>patches of genetically transformed skin onto the child. Gene therapy has been used to successfully treat children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a fatal genetic disease involving nerve cells. And in 2017, for the first time researchers used gene editing technology to directly alter genes within a patient’s body. They infused a patient with Hunter syndrome (a metabolic disease in which individuals lack an enzyme that breaks down polysaccharides) with viruses carrying a gene that encoded engineered zinc-finger nucleases and DNA consisting of a corrected copy of a gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ikM3L5aojg">Gene therapy has usually targeted only nonreproductive, or somatic, cells. Correcting genetic defects in these cells (termed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_HdNBpcjEk8">somatic gene therapy</i>) may provide positive benefits to patients but will not affect the genes of future generations. Gene therapy that alters reproductive, or germ-line, cells (termed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_050RoNaSYo">germ-line gene therapy</i>) is technically possible but raises a number of significant ethical issues because it has the capacity to alter the gene pool of future generations.</p>
