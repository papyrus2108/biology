<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xfrPgWevdZ">A major theme of molecular genetics is the central dogma, which states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_bIWNXcJcgp" id="ben_9781319297145_BxjfozJW9t">Figure 10.17a</a>). Although the central dogma provided a molecular basis for the connection between genotype and phenotype, it failed to address a critical question: How is the flow of information along this molecular pathway <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_VCKbVgpaFP">regulated</i>?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_p3n5erVIxq">Consider <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_5EcDa9pJIT">E. coli</i>, a bacterium that resides in your large intestine. Your eating habits completely determine the nutrients available to this bacterium: it can neither seek out nourishment when nutrients are scarce nor move away when confronted with an unfavorable environment. The bacterium makes up for its inability to alter the external environment by being internally flexible. For example, if glucose is present, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_LQu1Eu4PuA">E. coli</i> uses it to generate ATP; if there’s no glucose, it uses lactose, arabinose, maltose, xylose, or any of a number of other sugars. When amino acids are available, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7DqY97KOAw">E. coli</i> uses them to synthesize proteins; if a particular amino acid is absent, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_eAZjYR0HBl">E. coli</i> produces the enzymes needed to synthesize that amino acid. Thus, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_qg2mE89V0k">E. coli</i> responds to environmental changes by rapidly altering its biochemistry. This biochemical flexibility, however, has a high price. Constantly producing all the enzymes necessary for every environmental condition would be energetically expensive. So how does <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XFNwS1OO3D">E. coli</i> maintain biochemical flexibility while optimizing energy efficiency?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZbIMeKrKDn"><span aria-label="471" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page471" role="doc-pagebreak" title="471"/>The answer is through gene regulation. Bacteria carry the genetic information for synthesizing many proteins, but only a subset of that genetic information is expressed at any time. When the environment changes, new genes are expressed, and proteins appropriate for the new environment are synthesized. For example, if a carbon source appears in the environment, genes encoding enzymes that take up and metabolize that carbon source are quickly transcribed and translated. When that carbon source disappears, the genes that encode those enzymes are shut off.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3WOIJrbDTA">Multicellular eukaryotic organisms face a further challenge. Individual cells in a multicellular organism are specialized for particular tasks. The proteins produced by a nerve cell, for example, are quite different from those produced by a white blood cell. But although they differ in shape and function, a nerve cell and a white blood cell still carry the same genetic instructions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_xonQ98n20w">A multicellular organism’s challenge is to bring about the differentiation of cells that have a common set of genetic instructions (the process of development). This challenge is met through gene regulation: all of an organism’s cells carry the same genetic information, but only a subset of genes are expressed in each cell type; genes needed for other cell types are not expressed. Gene regulation is therefore the key to both unicellular flexibility and multicellular specialization, and it is critical to the success of all living organisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DMexVP7QHu">The mechanisms of gene regulation were first investigated in bacterial cells, in which the availability of mutants and the ease of laboratory manipulation made it possible to unravel these mechanisms. When the study of these mechanisms in eukaryotic cells began, eukaryotic gene regulation seemed very different from bacterial gene regulation. However, as more and more information has accumulated about gene regulation, a number of common themes have emerged. Today, many aspects of gene regulation in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are recognized to be similar. Before examining specific elements of bacterial gene regulation (in this chapter) and eukaryotic gene regulation (in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_hZScQArEm1">Chapter 17</a>), we briefly consider some themes of gene regulation common to all organisms.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Y9uC7St52c">First, genes can be regulated through the alteration of DNA or chromatin structure; this type of gene regulation takes place primarily in eukaryotes. Modifications to DNA or its packaging can help determine which sequences are available for transcription or the rate at which sequences are transcribed. DNA methylation and changes in chromatin structure are two processes that play a pivotal role in gene regulation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_SOfmC9C9wC">A second point at which a gene can be regulated is at the level of transcription. For the sake of cellular economy, <span aria-label="472" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page472" role="doc-pagebreak" title="472"/>limiting the production of a protein early in the process makes sense, and transcription is an important point of gene regulation in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QPYxSEqYpy">A third potential point of gene regulation is mRNA processing. Eukaryotic mRNA is extensively modified before it is translated: a 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_9TUW7HYxmc">′</sup> cap is added, the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_lwWThtjLRX">′</sup> end is cleaved and polyadenylated, and introns are removed (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_qYN9sJKwk2">Chapter 14</a>). These modifications determine the movement of the mRNA into the cytoplasm, whether the mRNA can be translated, the rate of translation, and the amino acid sequence of the protein produced, as well as mRNA stability. There is growing evidence that a number of regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotic cells operate at the level of mRNA processing. In prokaryotes, in which these types of mRNA processing are largely absent, control of gene expression occurs primarily at other points.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_24f4DztSOu">A fourth point for the control of gene expression is the regulation of mRNA stability. The amount of protein produced depends not only on the amount of mRNA synthesized but also on the rate at which the mRNA is degraded.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LEnURTsFQY">A fifth point of gene regulation is at the level of translation, a complex process requiring a large number of enzymes, protein factors, and RNA molecules (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fX20GwRzso" id="ben_9781319297145_VfH1HKFl4Y">Chapter 15</a>). All of these factors, as well as the availability of amino acids, affect the rate at which proteins are produced and therefore provide points at which gene expression can be controlled. Translation can also be affected by sequences in mRNA, such as those in the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_w1NTKQRsQh">′</sup> and 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_z0wWMlbtR9">′</sup> untranslated regions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QFgVGmXNWs">Finally, many proteins are modified after translation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fX20GwRzso" id="ben_9781319297145_tIoqxjr3JA">Chapter 15</a>), and these modifications affect protein stability and whether the proteins become active; therefore, genes can be regulated through processes that affect posttranslational modification. Gene expression can be affected by regulatory activities at any or all of these points.</p>

Within a domain, only a few amino acids actually make contact with the DNA. These amino acids (most commonly asparagine, glutamine, glycine, lysine, and arginine) often form hydrogen bonds with the bases or interact with the sugar–phosphate backbone of the DNA. Many DNA-binding proteins have additional domains that can bind other molecules, such as other regulatory proteins. By physically attaching to DNA, these proteins can affect the expression of a gene. Most DNA-binding proteins bind dynamically, which means that they transiently bind and unbind DNA and other regulatory proteins. Thus, although they may spend most of their time bound to DNA, they are never permanently attached. This dynamic nature means that other molecules can compete with DNA-binding proteins for regulatory sites on the DNA.</p>

One helix of the protein aligns with the turns of the D N A on both the sides and the turn part runs through the interior of the D N A helix.</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UTejWnFAaF">Part b is labeled Zinc fingers. The part shows a simple drawing and a ribbon model diagram of the zinc finger D N A-binding protein. The simple model, at the top, looks like 2 hairpin structures or 2 fingers, each one having 2 alpha helixes. In the middle of the hairpin is a zinc ion, positioned so that the 2 alpha helixes pinch together. The ribbon model diagram below shows the zinc finger interacting with the D N A double helix. The alpha helixes at the top of the zinc finger project into the major groove of the D N A helix and the rest of the protein is alongside the D N A double helix. The zinc ions lie directly underneath the fingers.</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_G7WEVUVz7q">Part c is labeled Leucine zipper. The part shows a simple drawing and a ribbon model diagram of the leucine zipper D N A-binding protein. The simple model, at the top, shows a linear protein containing an alpha helix, a straight line, and then a second longer alpha helix containing leucine side chains. The ribbon model diagram below shows the leucine zipper forming dimers and their interacting with the D N A double helix. The first alpha helix of the protein runs through the center of the D N A double helix and the second alpha helix of the protein has leucine that line up on one side of the protein. This portion of the protein forms dimers, so that leucines form a channel in the middle of the dimer.</p>
