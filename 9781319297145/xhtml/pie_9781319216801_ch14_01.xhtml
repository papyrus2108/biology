<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_LnXByE85To">On August 12, 1904, Tsar Nicholas Romanov II of Russia wrote in his diary: “A great never-to-be forgotten day when the mercy of God has visited us so clearly.” That day, Alexei, Nicholas’s first son and heir to the Russian throne, had been born.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MnFvrPRhkY">At birth, Alexei was a large and vigorous baby, with yellow curls and blue eyes, but at 6 weeks of age he began spontaneously hemorrhaging from the navel. The bleeding persisted for several days and caused great alarm. As he grew and began to walk, Alexei often stumbled and fell, as all children do. Even his small scrapes bled profusely, and minor bruises led to significant internal bleeding. It soon became clear that Alexei had hemophilia.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QLn2A72Job">Marked by slow clotting and excessive bleeding, hemophilia is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that encode proteins involved in the process of blood clotting. In people with hemophilia, minor injuries can result in life-threatening blood loss, and spontaneous bleeding into joints erodes the bone, with crippling consequences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hX2nTwWV0S">Alexei suffered from classic hemophilia, which is an X-linked genetic disorder. He inherited the hemophilia mutation from his mother, Alexandra, who was a carrier. The mutation appears to have originated with Queen Victoria of England (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZFqjgvWeeX" id="ben_9781319297145_Uc9x5Q6KuE">Figure 6.8</a>). In all, ten of Queen Victoria’s male descendants suffered from hemophilia. Six female descendants, including her granddaughter Alexandra (Alexei’s mother), were carriers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_285MTzAuB0">During his childhood, Alexei experienced a number of severe bleeding episodes. The royal physicians were often helpless during these crises—they had no treatment that would stop the bleeding. At this time, the Russian Revolution broke out. Bolsheviks captured the tsar and his family and held them captive in the city of Yekaterinburg. On the night of July 16, 1918, a firing squad executed the royal family and their attendants, including Alexei and his four sisters. For many years, the bodies of the tsar’s family were lost, but their skeletons were eventually recovered from two graves outside Yekaterinburg. Comparisons of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA from the bones and from descendants of relatives of the family verified that the bones were indeed those of the royal family. Although this analysis determined the identity of the remains, the molecular nature of the royal hemophilia long remained unknown.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bZghHpUScv">In 2009, geneticists analyzed DNA from the bones of the tsar’s family to determine the genetic nature of the royal hemophilia. In people with X-linked hemophilia, a mutation commonly occurs in one of two genes on the X chromosome: the gene for blood coagulation factor VIII or the gene for blood coagulation factor IX.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_twR2Debpxj">In eukaryotic cells, genes are often interrupted by noncoding sequences. Those parts of a gene that encode the amino acids of a protein are called exons, while the noncoding sequences are called introns. Initially, both exons and introns are transcribed into pre-mRNA, but in a process called RNA splicing, the introns are later cut out and the exons pasted together. Examination of the sequences of the two clotting factor genes in Alexandra’s DNA revealed no mutations in the nucleotides that encode amino acids, but a mutation was present in one of the introns of her gene for factor IX. This mutation altered the splicing of the exons, creating a new stop signal in the coding sequence of the mRNA and producing a truncated, defective clotting factor IX. Both normal and mutant alleles were detected in Alexandra’s DNA, as is expected of a heterozygous carrier. DNA from Alexei carried only the mutant allele, which caused his hemophilia.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_jjzRnmkQ8d">Classic hemophilia is inherited as an X-linked recessive condition. When a female is heterozygous for an X-linked recessive mutation such as hemophilia, what proportion of her male offspring are expected to have hemophilia? Examine the pedigree of the royal family in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZFqjgvWeeX" id="ben_9781319297145_rnHovl3AaW">Figure 6.8</a>. Calculate the proportion of affected male offspring born to females heterozygous for hemophilia. Carry out a chi-square goodness-of-fit test comparing the numbers of observed and expected male progeny of these females affected by hemophilia. What conclusion can you draw from the chi-square test?</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_lzUrgrZOAj">Hemophilia in the royal family was caused by the presence of a mutation in the gene for factor IX that altered the splicing of the exons and created a new stop signal in the mRNA for factor IX. Explain how a splicing mutation could produce a premature stop signal.</li>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_tzRAveKg5b">As illustrated by Alexei’s hemophilia, RNA processing is critically important for the proper synthesis of proteins. In eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules are often extensively modified after transcription: for genes that encode proteins, a modified nucleotide called the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_9tXuHKwAYM">′</sup> cap is added to the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_ycgZWkZIav">′</sup> end, a tail of adenine nucleotides is added to the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_X6Ppkr5HsQ">′</sup> end, and introns are cut out of the middle. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, rRNAs and tRNAs are also modified after transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bn4znrbZj5">In <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KBBmwjHUS4" id="ben_9781319297145_uYqolRSseL">Chapter 13</a>, we focused on transcription—the process by which RNA molecules are synthesized. In this chapter, we examine the function and processing of RNA. We begin by taking a careful look at the nature of the gene. We then examine messenger RNA (mRNA), its structure, and how it is modified in eukaryotes after transcription. Then we turn to transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that forms the interface between amino acids and mRNA in protein synthesis. We examine ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the structure and organization of rRNA genes, and how rRNAs are processed. Finally, we consider a newly discovered group of very small RNAs that play important roles in numerous biological functions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OCFaODe7KQ">As we explore the world of RNA and its role in gene function, we will see evidence of two important characteristics of this nucleic acid. First, RNA is extremely versatile, both structurally and biochemically. It can assume a number of different secondary structures, which provide the basis for <span aria-label="406" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page406" role="doc-pagebreak" title="406"/>its functional diversity. Second, RNA processing and function frequently include interactions between two or more RNA molecules.</p>
