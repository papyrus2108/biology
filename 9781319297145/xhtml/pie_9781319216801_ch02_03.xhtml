<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jdAOtMy4nK">For any cell to reproduce successfully, three fundamental events must take place: (1) its genetic information must be copied, (2) the copies must be separated from each other, and (3) the cell must divide. All cellular reproduction includes these three events, but the processes that lead to these events differ in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells because of their structural differences.</p>

Replication usually begins at a specific place on the circular chromosome, called the origin of replication. The origins of the two newly replicated chromosomes move away from each other and toward opposite ends of the cell. Proteins called structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes encircle the DNA and help keep the two newly synthesized chromosomes from getting tangled as they are replicated. Finally, a new cell wall forms between the two chromosomes, producing two cells, each with an identical copy of the chromosome. Under optimal conditions, some bacterial cells divide every 20 minutes. At this rate, a single bacterial cell could produce a billion descendants in a mere 10 hours.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gehuekp49R">Eukaryotic chromosomes are separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear membrane. The nucleus has a highly organized internal scaffolding, called the nuclear matrix, which consists of a network of protein fibers. The nuclear matrix maintains precise spatial relations among the components of the nucleus and takes part in DNA replication, the expression of genes, and the modification of gene products before they leave the nucleus.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UI5XmTTBrv">The chromosomes of eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex than those found in prokaryotes, but each unreplicated chromosome nevertheless consists of a single molecule of DNA. Although linear, the DNA molecules in eukaryotic chromosomes are highly folded and condensed; if stretched out, some human chromosomes would be several centimeters long—thousands of <span aria-label="22" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" role="doc-pagebreak" title="22"/>times as long as the span of a typical nucleus. To package such a tremendous length of DNA into the small volume of the nucleus, each DNA molecule is coiled around histone proteins and tightly packed, forming a rod-shaped chromosome. Most of the time, the chromosomes are thin and difficult to observe, but before cell division, they condense further into thick, readily observed structures; it is at this stage that chromosomes are usually studied.</p>

The nucleus with thread-like nuclear material is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and 4 small rectangular structures called centrosomes lie beside the nucleus. In the florescent image, a blue colored almost round nucleus is present with green webbed fibers around. A caption reads, the nuclear membrane is present and chromosomes are relaxed. This stage leads to prophase. The top center box shows prophase where chromosomes condense as coiled red and blue thread like structures which appear in the nucleus. The spindle fibers form as the centrosomes drift a little apart. This leads to formation of 4 X-shaped chromosomes where two are red chromosome and 2 are blue and each has 2 chromatids. A red and a blue chromosome are larger than its corresponding chromosome. The mitotic spindle elongates as the centrosomes further migrate to opposite sides of the cell. In the fluorescent image, the cell appears to have a larger nucleus (in fluorescent blue) than during interphase and the ends of the cells have spikey green material appear to be extending outwards. A caption reads, Chromosomes condense. Each chromosome possesses two chromatids. The mitotic spindle forms. This stage leads to prometaphase. Top right box shows prometaphase where the nuclear membrane disintegrates. The spindle microtubules attach to the chromatids from left and right ends and the centrosomes appear to be at opposite polar ends of the cell. The red chromosomes are at the top, attached to spindle fiber and blue ones are at bottom, as the spindle fibers now run horizontally from one cell pole to other. In the fluorescent image, a circular nucleus is not present, but blue stings project outward and all of the microtubules (in green) appear concentrated in the center of the image. A caption reads, the nuclear membrane disintegrates. Spindle microtubules attach to chromatids. This leads to next stage metaphase. The bottom right box shows metaphase where the chromosomes line up one below the other on the metaphase plate along the center of the cell. The blue one is at the top, followed by a red, blue and a red chromosome. In the fluorescent image, the blue strings that were once projecting outward, are now aligned in the middle of the green microtubules. A caption reads, chromsomes line up on the metaphase plate. This leads to next stage Anapahse. The bottom centre box shows anaphase where the sister chromatids separate as V shaped and move toward opposite poles. In the fluorescent picture, we see 2 blue and green spiky masses next to each other. A caption reads, sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles. This stage finally leads to next stage Telophase. The bottom right box shows telophase where the rod-shaped chromosomes arrive at spindle poles. The nuclear membrane re-forms and the chromosomes relax. Each nucleus now has 2 red(one small, one large) and 2 blue (one small, one large) rod shaped chromosomes. A vertical furrow is formed in the cell as it almost divides into two cells. One centrosome is present in each cell as tiny spindle fibers still are attached to them. In the fluorescent image, there are 2 circular objects each touching each other, both of which contain a blue circular masses on the opposite ends and a mass of green lines, which are less green in the middle, and thus must be in the process of separating from each other. A caption reads, Chromosomes arrive at spindle poles. The nuclear membrane re-forms and the chromosomes relax.</p></aside>

The mitotic spindle—an organized array of microtubules that move the chromosomes in mitosis—forms. In animal cells, the spindle grows out from a pair of centrosomes that migrate to the opposite sides of the cell.

The spindle microtubules are composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_jzAW1QQO5q" id="ben_9781319297145_8ZELWFJOtW"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_BY1Eyaob1y">Figure 2.11</strong></a>). During prometaphase, tubulin molecules are added to and removed from the microtubules, causing them to undergo repeated cycles of growth and shrinkage. When the end of a microtubule encounters a kinetochore, the microtubule becomes stabilized. Eventually, each chromosome becomes attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles: for each chromosome, a microtubule from one of the centrosomes anchors to the kinetochore of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_JprnjrN5pA">one</i> of the sister chromatids; a microtubule from the opposite centrosome then attaches to the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7P5WDCX0J2">other</i> sister chromatid, anchoring the chromosome to both of the centrosomes. This arrangement is known as chromosome bi-orientation.</p>

The centrosomes, now at opposite ends of the cell, with microtubules radiating outward from each one and meeting in the middle of the cell, center at the spindle poles.

If one chromatid is attached to a microtubule but the other is not, no tension is generated, and the cell is unable to progress to the next stage of mitosis.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yZ8gL2glrQ">What are the genetically important results of the cell cycle? From a single cell, the cell cycle produces two cells that contain the same genetic instructions. The resulting daughter cells are genetically identical with each other and with their parent cell because DNA synthesis in the S phase creates an exact copy of each DNA molecule, giving rise to two genetically identical sister chromatids. Mitosis then ensures that one of the two sister chromatids <span aria-label="27" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" role="doc-pagebreak" title="27"/>from each replicated chromosome passes into each new cell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vpsmGi50M7">Another genetically important result of the cell cycle is that each of the cells produced contains a full complement of chromosomes: there is no net reduction or increase in chromosome number. Each cell also contains approximately half the cytoplasm and organelle content of the original parent cell, but no precise mechanism analogous to mitosis ensures that organelles are evenly divided. Consequently, not all cells resulting from the cell cycle are identical in their cytoplasmic content.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_WnsiW0Kknz">The relations among chromosomes, chromatids, and DNA molecules frequently cause confusion. At certain times, chromosomes are unreplicated; at other times, each has undergone replication and possesses two chromatids (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_WzFwBaKFKz" id="ben_9781319297145_IEZKYWMcOf">Figure 2.7</a>). Chromosomes sometimes consist of a single DNA molecule; at other times, they consist of two DNA molecules. How can we keep track of the number of these structures in the cell cycle?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TmEUucc0tP">There are two simple rules for counting chromosomes and DNA molecules: (1) to determine the number of chromosomes, count the number of functional centromeres; (2) to determine the number of DNA molecules, first determine if sister chromatids are present. If sister chromatids are present, the chromosome has replicated, and the number of DNA molecules is twice the number of chromosomes. If sister chromatids are not present, the chromosome has not replicated, and the number of DNA molecules is the same as the number of chromosomes.</p>

In the S phase, each DNA molecule is copied. The two resulting DNA molecules combine with histones and other proteins to form sister chromatids. Although the amount of DNA doubles in the S phase, the number of chromosomes remains the same because the sister chromatids are tethered together and share a single functional centromere. At the end of the S phase, this cell still contains four chromosomes, each with two sister chromatids; so 4 × 2 = 8 DNA molecules are present.</p>

The column headers from left to right are as follows: G subscript 1; S; G subscript 2; Prophase and prometaphase; Metaphase; Anaphase; and Telophase and cytokinesis. The row entries from top to bottom are as follows:</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2BJX5hMnDk">Row 1: In G subscript 1, the cell has nucleus with two pairs of rod-shaped chromosomes; one is red and the other is blue; that are not attached at the centromere. The cell then progresses directly to the fourth column representing prophase and prometaphase, skipping S and G subscript 2 column. In, prophase and prometaphase stage, the nuclear membrane disintegrates and radially arranged spindle fibers are formed from the two poles of the cell. Four X-shaped chromosomes, 2 red and 2 blue, appear at the center of the cell that are attached to their respective sister chromatid through centromere. In metaphase, these four chromosomes align in a straight line forming the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers from poles are attached to centromeres of the four chromosomes. In anaphase, sister chromatids separate thereby becoming individual chromosomes that migrate toward spindle poles. The diagram shows laterally placed V-shaped chromosomes attached to spindle fibers. In telophase and cytokinesis, the cell divides into two daughter cells wherein chromosomes arrive at spindle poles, the nuclear membrane re-forms, and the condensed chromosomes relax.</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_1CWjm6MmBt">Row 2 (Number of chromosomes per cell): G subscript 1, 4; S, 4; G subscript 2, 4; Prophase and Prometaphase, 4; Metaphase, 4; Anaphase, 8; Telophase and cytokinesis, 4.</p><p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_F5dLMlx2Vx">Row 3 (Number of D N A molecules per cell): G subscript 1, 4; S, 4 becomes 8; G subscript 2, 8; Prophase and Prometaphase, 8; Metaphase, 8; Anaphase, 8; Telophase and cytokinesis, 4.</p></aside>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_78vgGP8cG1">Through prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase, the cell has four chromosomes and eight DNA molecules. At anaphase, however, the sister chromatids separate. Each now has its own functional centromere, so each is considered a separate chromosome. Until cytokinesis, the cell contains eight unreplicated chromosomes; thus, there are still eight DNA molecules present. After cytokinesis, the eight chromosomes (and eight DNA molecules) are distributed equally between two daughter cells, so each daughter cell contains four chromosomes and four DNA molecules—the number present at the beginning of the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_x64jHrCzBy">In summary, the number of chromosomes increases only in anaphase, when the two chromatids of a chromosome separate and become distinct chromosomes. The number of chromosomes decreases only through cytokinesis. The number of DNA molecules increases only in the S phase and decreases only through cytokinesis.</p>
