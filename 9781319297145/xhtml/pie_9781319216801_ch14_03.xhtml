<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_kqbsZy123y">As soon as DNA was identified as the source of genetic information, it became clear that DNA cannot directly encode proteins. In eukaryotic cells, DNA resides in the nucleus, yet protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm. Geneticists recognized that an additional molecule must take part in transferring genetic information.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fmhUJnmlL0">The results of studies of bacteriophage infection conducted in the late 1950s and early 1960s pointed to RNA as a likely candidate for this transport function. Bacteriophages inject their DNA into bacterial cells, where that DNA is replicated (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_sMlss9GGrV" id="ben_9781319297145_3ruUXOXFZd">Chapter 9</a>), and large amounts of phage protein are produced on the bacterial ribosomes. As early as 1953, Alfred Hershey discovered a type of RNA that was synthesized rapidly after bacteriophage infection. Findings from later studies showed that this short-lived RNA had a nucleotide composition similar to that of the phage DNA but quite different from that of the bacterial RNA. These observations were consistent with the idea that RNA was copied from DNA and that this RNA then directed the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CshKxDPUh1">At the time, ribosomes were known to be <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_b8tfUfFvK6">somehow</i> involved in protein synthesis, and much of the RNA in a cell was known to be in the form of ribosomes. Were ribosomes the agents by which genetic information was moved to the cytoplasm for the production of protein? Using isotopes of nitrogen and carbon and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_n4labJ5eKh" id="ben_9781319297145_mcZDitvQ5K">Figure 12.2</a>), Sydney Brenner, François Jacob, and Matthew Meselson demonstrated in 1961 that they were not. They showed that new ribosomes are <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_bWCqwmE6WF">not</i> produced during the burst of protein synthesis that accompanies bacteriophage infection (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Iyo7qP5Dj7" id="ben_9781319297145_82DjpuyPAi"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_I1utqZ3e1E">Figure 14.4</strong></a>). Thus, ribosomes could not be the carriers of the genetic information needed to produce new phage proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_hCmdZAIme1">The figure begins with a question that reads, Do ribosomes carry genetic information? The illustration shows a flask with a medium containing heavy isotopes (N left superscript 15 and C left superscript 13), at the top. A caption reads, E coli were grown in medium containing heavy isotopes through several generations so that the heavy isotopes would become incorporated into all E coli ribosomes. The cells were then transferred to a flask, placed below, with light isotopes N left superscript 14 and C left superscript 12. The cells are infected with bacteriophages. A caption reads, the cells were moved into medium containing light isotopes N left superscript 14 and C left superscript 12 and infected with bacteriophages. A burst of protein synthesis followed phage infection. If ribosomes carry genetic information for the synthesis of proteins, then new ribosomes, which should contain N left superscript 14 and C left superscript 12 and be relatively light, should appear after bacteriophage infection. The culture is then subjected to centrifugation below. A caption reads, after phage proteins were produced, ribosomes were separated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The culture is spun. The results show the components with increased density settling below in a test tube. A caption reads, only old ribosomes containing heavy isotopes (N left superscript 15 and C left superscript 13) were found. A caption below reads, Conclusion: Ribosomes are not produced in phage reproduction and therefore do not carry genetic information.</p>

Gros and his colleagues found that the newly produced phage RNA was short-lived, lasting only a few minutes, and was associated with ribosomes but was distinct from them. They concluded that this short-lived RNA carries the genetic information for proteins to the ribosome, where translation occurs. The term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Gdi7onCnOI">messenger RNA</i> was coined for this carrier.</p>

The splicing of group II introns is accomplished by a mechanism that has some similarities to the spliceosome-mediated splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA introns, and splicing generates a lariat structure. Because of these similarities, group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns are thought to be evolutionarily related: nuclear introns probably evolved from self-splicing group II introns and later adopted the proteins and snRNAs of the spliceosome to carry out the splicing reaction.</p>

Alternative processing of pre-mRNAs is common in multicellular eukaryotes. For example, researchers estimate that the products of more than 95% of all human genes with multiple exons undergo alternative splicing and that 50% of human genes have multiple 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_iFf6yIWILB">′</sup> cleavage sites.

A truncated form of the protein called apolipoprotein-B48—with only 2153 amino acids—is synthesized in intestinal cells through editing of the apolipoprotein-B100 mRNA. In this editing, an enzyme deaminates a cytosine base, converting it into uracil.
