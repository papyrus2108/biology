<header id="ben_9781319297145_AGQBFMr0SH"><h2 class="title v2" epub:type="title" id="ben_9781319297145_EozE7TYJpg">Epigenetics and the Dutch Hunger Winter</h2></header>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_PU77sk2SGD">In 1944, near the close of World War II, Allied armies marched north into the Netherlands to liberate the country from German occupation. The Allied advance, however, came to a halt at the Waal and Rhine rivers. To help the Allied cause, the Dutch people had carried out a railway strike; in retaliation, the German army blocked all food supplies to cities in the north of the country, and the Dutch people starved. From October through April, no food reached the area, and food supplies quickly ran out. People subsisted on bread and potatoes. In November 1944, food rations provided fewer than 1000 calories per person per day; by April 1945, many people were getting fewer than 500 calories per day. Thousands died. The famine ended in May 1945, when Allied armies liberated the entire country.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_o8pVb6hzkL">Known as the Dutch Hunger Winter, this terrible episode of intense starvation provides a natural experiment for examining the consequences of famine for humans. Researchers have been particularly interested in the long-term effects of starvation on people who were conceived and who developed prenatally during the famine. Numerous studies have examined these individuals, who are now adults. What the researchers found was remarkable: the caloric restriction that these people experienced while in the womb had life-long consequences. For example, men who were conceived and went through early development during the famine were twice as likely to be obese by age 18. Both men and women who underwent early development during the famine were more likely to be obese by age 50 and more likely to die from stroke and cardiovascular disease. They also experienced more cognitive decline in later life.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_n0zP2bK8Vh">Scientists believe that these long-term effects are due to epigenetic alterations: modifications of chromatin and DNA that alter gene expression but do not change the base sequence of the DNA. One common epigenetic change is DNA methylation, the addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases in the DNA. Geneticists examined DNA from individuals who were conceived during the Dutch Hunger Winter and compared it with DNA from their same-sex siblings conceived at other times. They examined 15 loci that are involved in growth and metabolic disease. Of these loci, 6 showed significant differences in methylation patterns. At some loci, methylation was higher among the famine-exposed individuals, and at other loci, methylation was lower.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Lc8e8f8iIV">These results show that an early life event—caloric restriction during prenatal development—can bring about alterations in chromatin structure that have long-term consequences. Studies on rodents show that the phenotypic effects of nutrition can carry over for several generations. As this chapter explains, epigenetic alterations can be passed from cell to cell and sometimes from generation to generation. Epigenetic inheritance was not envisioned by Mendel nor, until recently, by most modern geneticists, but epigenetic processes appear to play an important role in the inheritance of many phenotypes. Today, the study of epigenetics is the focus of intensive research.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_j8TPS5yd2B">A question that this study raises is why limited calories during prenatal development would <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_bZZdtoVSFR">increase</i> adult obesity and risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. One might <span aria-label="652" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page652" role="doc-pagebreak" title="652"/>expect just the opposite, that nutritional stress during fetal development would decrease adult body weight. Evolutionary biologists have proposed an explanation for this relation, which has also been observed in other studies. Termed the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_9uwYrMzLmw">thrifty phenotype hypothesis</i>, it proposes that when environmental conditions are poor during fetal development, they are usually likely to persist and to be poor in adult life as well. The fetus responds by developing a metabolically thrifty phenotype—eating as much as possible when food is available, minimizing energy expenditure, and lowering metabolic rate—because the prenatal environment predicts that there will be little food available in the future. This strategy was probably advantageous in the distant past, before agriculture, but it often backfires in modern society. Eating all you can, minimizing energy expenditure, and hoarding calories when food is plentiful often leads to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_NNjGCju4Ni">This chapter is about epigenetics, which is the explanation for the effect of famine on the future health of the people who were conceived during the Dutch Hunger Winter. We begin by discussing the origin of the term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_AAbTH1VouW">epigenetics</i> and what the term encompasses today. We then review the types of changes in chromatin that can occur and the major processes that alter chromatin structure. We also take a look at how changes in chromatin structure might be passed on to future cells and future generations. We then look at a number of epigenetic effects, including effects on cell differentiation, X inactivation, genomic imprinting, effects on monozygotic twins, paramutation, behavioral effects, the effects of chemicals, and metabolic effects. We end the chapter by discussing efforts to map the genome-wide pattern of epigenetic marks—the epigenome.</p>
