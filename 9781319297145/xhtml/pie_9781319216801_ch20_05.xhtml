<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_FIHifOnDxu">DNA sequence data offer tremendous insight into the biology of an organism, but they are not the whole story. Many genes encode proteins, and proteins carry out the vast majority of the biochemical reactions that shape the phenotype of an organism. Although proteins are encoded by DNA sequences, many proteins undergo modifications after translation, and in more complex eukaryotes, there are many more proteins than genes. Thus, in recent years, molecular biologists have turned their attention to analysis of the protein content of cells. Their ultimate goal is to determine the proteome: the complete set of proteins found in a given cell. The study of the proteome is termed

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vc00KWGMaR">Proteins make up about 50% of the dry mass of a cell; a typical cell may contain over a billion individual protein molecules. Different proteins in a cell may be present as only a few copies or over a million copies. Elucidating the complex and changing nature of the proteome is a major technical challenge. Efforts to identify and characterize all proteins in the human body has been called the

The project is cataloging the proteins present in each cell type, the location of each protein within the cell, and the other proteins with which each interacts. This information will be of immense benefit in identifying drug targets, understanding the biological basis of disease, and understanding the molecular basis of many biological processes. In the future, proteomics may be coupled with genome editing, in which the findings of proteomics are tested using CRISPR-Cas (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_FeEszUqHoV">Chapter 19</a>) to delete or modify protein-encoding genes in specific ways, followed by additional proteomics methods to measure the effect of the gene alterations on the protein content of the cell.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hMrBJpIL4P">Because 2D-PAGE does not detect some proteins in low abundance and is difficult to automate, researchers have turned to liquid chromatography for separating proteins. In liquid chromatography, a mixture of molecules is dissolved in a liquid and passed through a column packed with solid particles. Different affinities for the liquid and solid phases cause some components of the mixture to travel through the column more slowly than others, resulting in separation of the components of the mixture.</p>

With recent advances, researchers can now carry out “shotgun” proteomics, which eliminates most of the initial protein-separation stage. In this procedure, a complex mixture of proteins (such as those from a tissue sample) is digested and analyzed with mass spectrometry. The computer program then sorts out the proteins present in the sample by analyzing the peptide profiles.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ie5FfwZ0nw">The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a protein provides a great deal of useful information. It is often a source of insight into the function of an unknown protein; it may also suggest the locations of active sites and provide information about other molecules that interact with the protein. Furthermore, knowledge of a protein’s structure often suggests targets for potential drugs that might interact with the protein. Therefore, one goal of proteomics is to determine the structure of every protein found in a cell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_X2w6HMqgg6">Two procedures are currently used to solve the structures of complex proteins: (1) X-ray crystallography, in which crystals of the protein are bombarded with X-rays, and the diffraction patterns of the X-rays are used to determine the structure (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_B3yqFawZE4" id="ben_9781319297145_nItWgprWzw">Section 10.2</a>); and (2) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), <span aria-label="643" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page643" role="doc-pagebreak" title="643"/>which provides information on the positions of specific atoms within a molecule by using the magnetic properties of their nuclei.</p>

Because the structures of hundreds of thousands of proteins are required for studies of the proteome, researchers ultimately hope to be able to predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Such predictions are not possible at the present time, but the hope is that if the enough high-resolution structures are solved, it will be possible in the future to model a protein’s structure from the amino acid sequence alone. As scientists work on automated methods that will speed the structural determination of proteins, bioinformaticians are developing better computer programs for predicting protein structure from sequence.</p>
