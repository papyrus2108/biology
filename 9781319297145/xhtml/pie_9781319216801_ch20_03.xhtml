<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_qyjUUDGbQU">The nucleotide sequence of a gene can be used to predict the amino acid sequence of the protein it encodes. The protein can then be synthesized or isolated and its properties studied to determine its function. However, this biochemical approach to understanding gene function is both time-consuming and expensive. A major goal of functional genomics has been to develop computational methods that allow gene function to be identified from DNA sequence alone, bypassing the laborious process of isolating and characterizing individual proteins.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PWCBXgMpLi">Databases containing genes and proteins found in a wide array of organisms are available for homology searches. Powerful computer programs, such as BLAST, have been developed for scanning these databases to look for particular sequences. Suppose a geneticist sequences a genome and locates a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function. A homology search conducted on databases containing the DNA or protein sequences of other organisms may identify one or more orthologous sequences. If a function is known for a protein encoded by one of those sequences, that could provide information about the function of the newly discovered protein. Sometimes searches do not identify homologous genes; in that case, researchers may look for parts of a gene that are similar to parts of other genes with known functions. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_a8Iqr14cdi">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_nv2IfAM9Bc" id="ben_9781319297145_sh2BxRhkc5">PROBLEM 36</a></strong></p>

For example, certain DNA-binding proteins attach to DNA in the same way; these proteins share a domain that provides the DNA-binding function. Some DNA-binding proteins have a domain called a zinc finger, consisting of a loop of amino acids containing a zinc ion (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch16_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNK2N04MLy" id="ben_9781319297145_a8yNQ1Fo4Q">Chapter 16</a>). Each protein domain has an arrangement of amino acids common to that domain (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch16_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_MTD5c5GDQG" id="ben_9781319297145_YB1HcIHtZa">Figure 16.2</a>). Protein domains have been relatively stable over evolutionary time; for example, protein domains found in humans are also found in other multicellular eukaryotes. There is probably a limited, though large, number of protein domains, which have mixed and matched through evolutionary time to yield the protein diversity seen in present-day organisms.</p>

Yellow fluorescence (red plus green) indicates equal expression of the gene in both types of cells; red indicates more expression in cancer cells; and green indicates more expression in non-cancer cells.” The results section shows a heat map with green and red color. Green color occupies most of the space in the map. Captions pointing to the heat map read, “The microarray scan is converted to a heat map, where green represents decreased expression, red increased expression, and black no change in expression.

They can also be used to investigate how gene expression changes in the course of biological processes, such as development or disease progression. For example, breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the United States, and half of those women die from it. Current treatment depends on a number of <span aria-label="631" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page631" role="doc-pagebreak" title="631"/>factors, including a woman’s age, the size of the tumor, the characteristics of the tumor cells, and whether the cancer has already spread to nearby lymph nodes. Many women whose cancer has not spread are treated by removal of the tumor and radiation therapy, yet the cancer later reappears in some of the women thus treated. These women might benefit from more aggressive treatment when the cancer is first detected.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7QjDAh8W7Y">Using microarrays, researchers examined the expression patterns of 25,000 genes from primary tumors of 78 young women who had breast cancer (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_muHVZeo4TU" id="ben_9781319297145_JytJKTee3e">Figure 20.10</a>). Messenger RNA from the cancer cells and from noncancer cells was converted into cDNA and labeled with red fluorescent nucleotides and green fluorescent nucleotides, respectively. The labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized to a DNA chip, which contained DNA probes from numerous genes. Hybridization of the red (cancer) and green (noncancer) cDNAs was proportional to the relative amounts of mRNA in the samples. The fluorescence of each spot was assessed with microscopic scanning and appeared as a single color. Red indicated the overexpression of a gene in the cancer cells relative to its expression in the noncancer cells (more red-labeled cDNA hybridized), whereas green indicated the underexpression of a gene in the cancer cells relative to its expression in the noncancer cells (more green-labeled cDNA hybridized). Yellow indicated equal expression in both types of cells (equal hybridization of red- and green-labeled cDNAs), and no color indicated no expression in either type of cell. This information about gene expression was then converted into a heat map that displays the relative expression of genes in the tumors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_e02190xu30">In 34 of the 78 patients, the cancer later spread to other sites; the other 44 patients remained free of breast cancer for 5 years after their initial diagnoses. The researchers identified a subset of 70 genes whose expression patterns in the initial tumors accurately predicted whether the cancer would later spread (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_muHVZeo4TU" id="ben_9781319297145_MAuMuJXYVF">Figure 20.10</a>). This degree of prediction was much higher than that of traditional predictive measures, which are based on the size and appearance of the tumor.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ylZX2lflaG">Researchers have also used microarrays to examine the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cancers. Recent research indicates that miRNAs are frequently expressed abnormally in cancerous tissue and may contribute to the progression of cancer (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2NV3AY3MA4" id="ben_9781319297145_PgpVHGoR4a">Section 23.2</a>). For example, one study using microarrays found that several miRNAs were overexpressed in cancerous cervical tissue compared with normal cervical tissue, while other miRNAs were underexpressed (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_kesHMIEgOA"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hy6aJzX2eO" id="ben_9781319297145_wQTXgsBEzn">Figure 20.11</a></strong>). Other studies using microarrays have demonstrated that miRNA expression is associated with resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiation, and that miRNA expression can be used to predict the responses of some tumors to cancer treatment. Results such as these suggest that gene-expression data obtained from microarrays can be a powerful tool in cancer research and treatment. The products of the genes that show differences in expression are being examined as possible targets for drug therapy. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_kLUXL5L8Fo">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_v5f8czYgwM" id="ben_9781319297145_VFtlVUsRKT">PROBLEM 37</a></strong></p>

An early application of this method was used to create a transcriptome map of yeast and revealed, surprisingly, that 75% of the nonrepetitive sequences in the yeast genome are transcribed. RNA sequencing has also been used to help identify mutations causing genetic diseases. In one study, researchers compared RNA sequences in skeleton muscle from patients with undiagnosed skeletal disorders to those from healthy controls. The presence of abnormal RNA sequences in the patients pointed to specific mutations in the DNA that were responsible for their skeletal disorders.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_f98Jyujnmp">Methods have been developed for isolating and sequencing RNA from single cells (termed single-cell RNA sequencing, or scRNA-seq) so that differences in gene expression among cells can be studied. For example, researchers sequenced RNA from 4645 individual cells collected from 19 patients with melanoma. The analysis revealed heterogeneity in gene expression among cells: malignant and nonmalignant cells differed in gene expression. Within the malignant cells, there were also differences, some of which were associated with resistance to anticancer drugs. Single-cell RNA sequencing is being used to characterize cellular diversity found in different tissues. For example, researchers examined gene expression patterns in over 500,000 individual cells from the mouse brain, finding several hundred types of cells based on their expression profiles. Similar studies have used scRNA-seq to define cell diversity in kidneys and the immune system. In another study, researchers studied expression patterns in individual brain cells over the lifespan of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rsFhsshdKe">Drosophila</i> and found that, as flies age, overall RNA levels of brain cells decline, as do the number of genes expressed.</p>

But this procedure was limited by the number of naturally occurring mutations and the difficulty of mapping genes with a limited number of chromosomal markers. The number of naturally occurring mutations can be increased by exposing organisms to mutagens, and the accuracy of mapping is increased dramatically by the availability of mapped molecular markers, such as SNPs.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YAHxsg5EZ9">To conduct a mutagenesis screen, random mutations are induced in a population of organisms, creating new phenotypes. Mutations can be induced by exposing the organisms to radiation, chemical mutagens, or transposable elements (DNA sequences that insert randomly into the DNA) (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_druJmSR46T" id="ben_9781319297145_waKqZKGDU3">Chapter 18</a>). CRISPR-Cas (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_pcACK0lDzA" id="ben_9781319297145_yJE6qagH20">Chapter 19</a>) is now being widely used for mutagenesis screens. The procedure for a typical mutagenesis screen is illustrated in <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_CGbxtTT2o0"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qdPtpF2n76" id="ben_9781319297145_eshQyU4LWu">Figure 20.14</a></strong>. Here, male zebrafish are treated with ethylmethylsulfonate (EMS), a chemical that induces germ-line mutations in their sperm. The treated males are then mated with wild-type female fish. A few of the offspring will be heterozygous for mutations induced by EMS. The offspring are screened for any mutant phenotypes that might be the products of dominant mutations expressed in these heterozygous fish. Recessive mutations are not expressed in the F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_NYvkvOwbGS">1</sub> progeny but can be revealed with further breeding. The fish with variant phenotypes undergo further breeding experiments to verify that each variant phenotype is, in fact, due to a single-gene mutation. The gene in which the mutation occurs is not known but can be located with positional cloning (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_AXby7qzMwF">Chapter 19</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4609tdlOxz">The question in this experiment is: How can genes encoding a particular trait or function be identified? The methods section shows a cross between a treated male fish and a wild-type female fish. A caption reads, “Male zebrafish are treated with E M S or C R I S P R-Cas to produce mutations in their sperm and are then crossed with wild-type females.” The cross leads to four fish progenies with genotype as follows: positive over positive, small M squared over positive, positive over positive, big M superscript 1 over positive. A caption pointing towards small M squared over positive fish reads, “Progeny fish are screened for mutant phenotypes. A recessive mutation (small M squared) will not be expressed in the F1 phenotype.” A caption pointing towards big M superscript 1 over positive fish reads, “Variant fish may possess a dominant mutation (M 1).” Then a cross is shown between positive over positive and small M squared over positive fish. It leads two same fishes. A caption reads, “Progeny fish with normal phenotypes are mated with wild-type fish and backcrossed to reveal recessive mutations.” Results section shows three fishes of the genotype: small M squared over positive, small M squared over small M squared, and positive over positive. Small M squared over small M squared is then subjected to further breeding and positional cloning. The fish with genotype big M superscript 1 over positive from the first cross is also subjected to further breeding and positional cloning. Text at the bottom reads, “Conclusion: The mutagenesis screen produces fish with a mutation affecting the trait. These fish are further analyzed to identify the mutation.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fSv7UDb8Nr">Mutagenesis screens have been used to study genes that control vertebrate development. A team of developmental geneticists have produced thousands of mutations in the zebrafish that affect development and are systematically locating and characterizing the loci where these mutations occur. Zebrafish are ideal genetic models for this type of study because they reproduce quickly, are easily reared in the laboratory, and have transparent embryos in which developmental deformities are easy to spot. This research has already identified a number of genes that are important in embryonic development, many of which have counterparts in humans.</p>
