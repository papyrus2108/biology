<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_DILJT5Fo1E">Our knowledge of human genetic diseases and disorders has expanded rapidly in recent years. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Web site now lists more than 24,000 human genetic diseases, disorders, genes, and traits that have a simple genetic basis. Research has provided a great deal of information about the inheritance, chromosomal location, biochemical basis, and symptoms of many of these genetic traits, diseases, and disorders. This information is often useful to people who have a genetic condition.</p>

It is an educational process that helps patients and family members deal with many aspects of having a genetic condition: its diagnosis, symptoms and treatment, and mode of inheritance. Genetic counseling also helps patients and their families cope with the psychological and physical stress that may be associated with the disorder. Clearly, all of these considerations cannot be handled by a single health professional; most genetic counseling is done by a team that may include genetic counselors, physicians, medical geneticists, and laboratory personnel. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_fuw9HwpSL4"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_7OsU6tIOU2" id="ben_9781319297145_HSvPBttiFg">Table 6.3</a></strong> lists some common reasons for seeking genetic counseling.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_44qBuTwkcD">Genetic counseling usually begins with a diagnosis of a condition that may have a genetic basis. On the bases of a physical examination, biochemical tests, DNA testing, chromosome analysis, family history, and other information, a physician determines the cause of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is critical because appropriate treatment and the probability of passing the condition on depend on the diagnosis. For example, there are a number of different types of dwarfism, caused by chromosome abnormalities, single-gene mutations, hormonal imbalances, and environmental factors. People who have dwarfism resulting from an autosomal dominant gene have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their children, whereas people who have dwarfism caused by a rare recessive gene have a low likelihood of doing so.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wRlqB5df7q">When the nature of the condition is known, a genetic counselor meets with the patient and members of the patient’s family and explains the diagnosis. A family pedigree may be constructed, and the probability of transmitting the condition to future generations can be calculated for different family members. The counselor helps the family interpret the genetic risks and explains various available <span aria-label="162" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" role="doc-pagebreak" title="162"/>reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, artificial insemination, and in vitro fertilization. Family members often have questions about genetic testing that may be available to help determine whether they carry a particular genetic mutation. The counselor helps them decide whether genetic testing is appropriate for them and which tests to apply. After the test results are in, the genetic counselor usually helps family members interpret the results.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2psD45plJg">A family’s decision about future pregnancies frequently depends on the magnitude of the genetic risk, the severity and effects of the condition, the importance they place on having children, and their religious and cultural views. Traditionally, genetic counselors have been trained to apply <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PjY819PnfG">nondirected</i> counseling, which means that they provide information and facilitate discussion but do not bring their own opinions and values into the discussion. The goal of nondirected counseling is for the family to reach its own decision on the basis of the best available information.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5blo7PXffl">Because of the growing number of genetic tests available and the complexity of assessing genetic risk, there is now some movement away from completely nondirected counseling. The goal is still to provide the family with information about all options and to reach the decision that is best for them, but that goal may sometimes require the counselor to recommend certain options, much as a physician recommends the most appropriate medical treatments for his or her patient.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_r8p78ebm6Y">Who does genetic counseling? In the United States, over 7000 health professionals are certified in genetics by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics or the American Board of Genetic Counseling. About half of them are specifically trained in genetic counseling, usually through a special two-year master’s degree program that provides education in both genetics and counseling. Most of the remainder are physicians and scientists certified in medical or clinical genetics. Because of the shortage of genetic counselors and medical geneticists, information about genetic testing and genetic risk is often conveyed by primary care physicians, nurses, and social workers. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_3LavnMtMZ2">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_IexsNOvXKa" id="ben_9781319297145_PpA0UrED5O">PROBLEM 10</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_PnktDUxdhj">The ultimate goal of genetic testing is to recognize the potential for a genetic condition at an early stage. In some cases, genetic testing allows people to make informed choices about reproduction. In other cases, genetic testing allows early intervention that may lessen or even prevent the development of a condition. For those who know that they are at risk for a genetic condition, genetic testing may help alleviate anxiety associated with the uncertainty of their situation. Genetic testing includes prenatal testing and postnatal testing.</p>

The <span aria-label="163" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" role="doc-pagebreak" title="163"/>major purpose of prenatal tests is to provide families with the information that they need to make choices during pregnancies and, in some cases, to prepare for the birth of a child with a genetic condition.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2UWUxjPrbf">A major disadvantage of amniocentesis is that it generally cannot be performed until about the 15th to 18th week of a pregnancy (although some obstetricians successfully perform amniocentesis earlier). The cells obtained by amniocentesis must then be cultured before genetic tests can be performed, which requires yet more time. For these reasons, genetic information about the fetus may not be available until the 17th or 18th week of pregnancy. By this stage, if abortion is chosen, it carries a greater risk of complications and is often stressful for the parents.

Although the chorion is composed of fetal cells, it is a part of the placenta, which is expelled from the uterus after birth; the tissue that is removed is not actually from the fetus. This tissue contains millions of actively dividing cells that can be used directly in many genetic tests. Chorionic villus sampling has a somewhat higher risk of complications than amniocentesis; the results of several studies suggest that this procedure may increase the incidence of limb defects in the fetus when performed earlier than the 10th week of pregnancy.</p>

However, these tests do not determine the presence of a genetic problem; rather, they simply indicate that the fetus is at increased risk of a problem and hence are referred to as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7kq41zUKTR">screening</i> tests. When increased risk is detected, follow-up tests (additional blood screening tests, ultrasound, amniocentesis, or all three) are usually conducted.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TkE4vlKrLu">One substance examined in maternal blood screening tests is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ljXoen1667">α</i>-fetoprotein, a protein that is normally produced by the fetus during development and is present in fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and the mother’s blood during pregnancy. The level of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wM1oJtsBiH">α</i>-fetoprotein is significantly higher than normal when the fetus has a neural-tube defect or one of several other disorders. Some chromosome abnormalities produce lower-than-normal levels of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2NqZEBvVFx">α</i>-fetoprotein. Measuring the amount of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_5oFuPnXBqd">α</i>-fetoprotein in the mother’s blood gives an indication of these conditions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7nelVGSQUC">One typical test, carried out between the 9th and 13th weeks of pregnancy, measures human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, a pregnancy hormone) and a substance called pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). When the fetus has certain chromosome abnormalities, the level of PAPP-A tends to be low and the level of hCG tends to be high. The risk of a chromosome abnormality is calculated on the basis of the levels of hCG and PAPP-A in the mother’s blood along with the results of ultrasound. Another test, referred to as the quad screen, is usually conducted in the second trimester of pregnancy and measures the levels of four substances: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tJID27tykc">α</i>-fetoprotein, hCG, estriol, and inhibin. The risk of chromosome abnormalities and certain other birth defects is calculated on the basis of the combined levels of the four substances plus the mother’s age, weight, ethnic background, and number of fetuses. The quad screen successfully detects Down syndrome (due to three copies of chromosome 21) approximately 80% of the time and has a false positive rate of about 5%.</p>

These tests can be performed as early as the 9th to 10th week of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3EFq1G9xSI">During pregnancy, a few fetal cells are released into the mother’s circulatory system, where they mix with and circulate with her blood. When these fetal cells break down, they release free-floating fragments of fetal DNA, which can be sequenced and analyzed. By comparing the number of copies of genetic variants found on different chromosomes, it is possible to determine if there are extra copies of some fetal chromosomes present and therefore to screen for Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and other chromosome abnormalities (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kh0AYDKt5S" id="ben_9781319297145_S4VrxyyC6B">Chapter 8</a>) in the fetus. When a chromosome abnormality is detected, diagnosis is confirmed with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Research suggests that noninvasive prenatal screening for Down syndrome is more accurate and has a much lower false positive rate than traditional maternal blood screening procedures that rely on levels of substances such as <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Xb8ejG55Ta">α</i>-fetoprotein, hCG, estriol, and inhibin. Recently, researchers used measurement of cell-free fetal RNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GFgAZXquK9" id="ben_9781319297145_Wx9Cjweq6Z">RNA sequencing in Chapter 20</a>) to accurately estimate gestational age and estimate the risk of preterm birth.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2AlV542Cov">Prenatal genetic screening tests based on DNA in the mother’s blood occasionally reveal information about the mother’s genetic makeup or health. For example, sometimes DNA analysis detects the presence of a Y chromosome, but ultrasound reveals a female fetus. In a few rare instances, this finding is due to a previously undiagnosed sex chromosome anomaly of the mother (although there are other potential explanations as well). Occasionally, testing can reveal the presence of undiagnosed cancer in the mother. Whether and how this type of incidental genetic information should be conveyed to the mother, who did not request genetic testing on herself, remains the subject of discussion among genetic counselors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NCs4Sr51HV">Noninvasive prenatal screening technology creates the potential in the future to use a single blood sample from the mother to test for hundreds of genetic diseases and even for ordinary traits in the fetus. At the present time, this is technically difficult and beyond routine clinical practice due to the confounding effects of maternal DNA, but researchers have demonstrated that they can sequence the entire fetal genome from a maternal blood sample. This possibility raises a number of social and ethical questions about the use of such information in reproductive decisions.</p>

New reproductive technologies provide couples with options for using this information. One of these technologies is in vitro fertilization. In this procedure, hormones are used to induce ovulation. The ovulated eggs are surgically removed from the surface of the ovary, placed in a laboratory dish, and fertilized with sperm. The resulting embryo is then implanted in the uterus.

For example, if a woman is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disease, approximately half of her sons are expected to have the disease. Through in vitro fertilization and PGD, an embryo without the disorder can be selected for implantation in her uterus.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Bmcyg39smP">The procedure begins with the production of several single-celled embryos through in vitro fertilization. The embryos are allowed to divide several times until they reach the 8- or 16-cell stage. At this point, one cell is removed from each embryo and tested for the genetic abnormality. Removing a single cell at this early stage does not harm the embryo. Once the embryos that are free of the disorder have been identified, a healthy embryo is selected and implanted in the woman’s uterus.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mUJppHuq3g">Preimplantation genetic diagnosis requires the ability to conduct genetic testing on a single cell. Such testing is possible with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, through which minute quantities of DNA can be amplified (replicated) quickly (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_l4CX7zYmo3" id="ben_9781319297145_zGiIuhbcN5">Chapter 19</a>). Once the cell’s DNA has been amplified, the DNA sequence is examined. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis has resulted in the birth of thousands of healthy children. Its use raises a number of ethical concerns because it can be used as a means of selecting for or against genetic traits that have nothing to do with medical concerns. For example, it can potentially be used to select for a child with genes for a certain eye color or genes for increased height.</p>

In the general population of North America, the frequency of Tay–Sachs disease is only about 1 person in 360,000. Among Ashkenazi Jews (descendants of Jewish people who settled in eastern and central Europe), the frequency is 100 times greater. A simple blood test is used to identify Ashkenazi Jews who carry the allele for Tay–Sachs disease. If a man and woman are both heterozygotes, approximately one-fourth of their children are expected to have Tay–Sachs disease. Couples identified as heterozygous carriers may use that information in deciding whether to have children. A prenatal test is also available for determining if the fetus of an at-risk couple will have Tay–Sachs disease. Screening programs have led to a significant decline in the number of children of Ashkenazi ancestry born with Tay–Sachs disease (now fewer than 10 children per year in the United States).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_CMPI3tns2H">Genetic testing is becoming increasingly important in guiding drug treatment. In some cases, a drug’s effectiveness is influenced by a patient’s genotype; in other cases, individuals with certain genotypes may be more likely to suffer from adverse drug reactions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JKhJqYuy4J">Warfarin provides a good example of how genetic testing can be used in conjunction with drug treatment. Warfarin is the most common anticoagulant (blood thinner) used worldwide. It is often administered to people with certain heart problems and after surgery to prevent the formation of clots in the blood vessels, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to tissue death. An effective dose of warfarin is critical: too little, and blood clots are not prevented; too much, and internal bleeding results. Unfortunately, people vary greatly in their responses to warfarin, and some of this variation is due to genes. For example, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_YxBX5oyurx">CYP2C9</i> is a gene that encodes an enzyme that metabolizes warfarin. Over 30 different alleles occur at this locus. People who are homozygous for the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_8cZnRmg8Pw">CYP2C9*1</i> allele metabolize warfarin normally, but individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for <span aria-label="167" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page167" role="doc-pagebreak" title="167"/>the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ozpaUrcrB6">CYP2CP9*2</i> or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_OoHYWFLrde">CYP2CP9*3</i> alleles metabolize warfarin at a much lower rate and therefore require a lower dose. If given the usual dose of warfarin, these people are at greater risk of bleeding. Genetic variation at <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_usB587lurD">CYP2CP</i> and another locus called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_iWi7VZH0De">VKORC1</i> accounts for up to 30% of the variation in response to warfarin dose and risk of bleeding. Some hospitals are screening patients for variation at these genes to help determine the proper warfarin dose to administer. A study conducted by Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, found that over 90% of all patients carried one or more genetic variants that affected their response to five common drugs, including warfarin. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_MHsUjj4B1M">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_I6C8eaQ7Xd" id="ben_9781319297145_bpubBvxUBm">PROBLEM 12</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xKCwoRKQSk">Today, more than a thousand genetic tests are clinically available, and several hundred more are available through research studies. Future research will greatly increase the number and complexity of genetic tests. Many of these tests will be for complex multifactorial diseases that are influenced by both genetics and environment, such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, asthma, some types of cancer, and depression.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tmSE59ZefX">Interpreting the results of genetic tests is often complicated by several factors. First, some genetic diseases can be caused by many different mutations. For example, more than a thousand different mutations at a single locus can cause cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease in which chloride ion transport is defective (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1Cr0Us1Qbh" id="ben_9781319297145_fZkse2zk2i">Chapter 5</a>). Genetic tests typically screen for only the most common mutations; uncommon and rare mutations are not detected. Therefore, a negative result does not mean that a genetic defect is absent; it indicates only that the person being tested does not have one of the common mutations. The DNA of an affected person can be examined to determine the nature of the mutation, and other family members can then be screened for the same mutation, but this option is not possible if affected family members are unavailable or unwilling to be tested.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Y08liz3Nhz">A second problem lies in interpreting the results of genetic tests. For a classic genetic disease such as Tay–Sachs disease, the inheritance of two copies of the gene virtually ensures that a person will have the disease. However, this is not the case for many genetic diseases for which penetrance is incomplete and environmental factors play a role. For these conditions, carrying a disease-predisposing mutation only elevates a person’s risk of acquiring the disease. The risk associated with a particular mutation is a statistical estimate, based on the average effect of the mutation on many people. In this case, the calculated risk may provide little useful information to a specific person. It is also important to keep in mind that for many genetic traits and disorders, no genetic test exists.</p>

Several companies sold such tests in the United States prior to 2013, when their sale was restricted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_VYmYKRevg4">Many people are curious about their ancestry. A number of Web sites facilitate the collection of genealogical records, with over 100 million users in 2018. Some of these genealogical databases automatically detect similarities between family trees and offer the option to merge family records from different sources, creating very large groups with thousands or even millions of individuals connected by shared ancestry. In addition, DNA tests are available to help people study their ancestry. For example, the Genographic Project, sponsored by National Geographic, determines ancient ancestry based on DNA testing; it provides information on regional ancestry—the proportion of one’s genome that comes from nine ancestral source populations—as well as the presence of any Neanderthal DNA in one’s genome. Other databases compile data from genetic testing to help people find their biological relatives.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ILgZOrvzid">Researchers have begun to use genealogical and ancestry databases for examining questions about human genetics and evolution, including the inheritance of traits, the genetic structure of populations, migration, and changing patterns of relatedness and fertility. For example, researchers examined over 60,000 participants of direct-to-consumer genetic testing to study the genetics of earlobe attachment and demonstrated that—contrary to common wisdom—free versus attached earlobes are not inherited as a simple genetic trait; rather, this trait is polygenic and determined by variation at a number of different genes. The use of these databases for research and other purposes has, however, raised ethical concerns about using the information in ways that were not anticipated by the participants.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_3k8b4tQ6Jy">With the development of so many new genetic tests, concerns have been raised about the privacy of genetic information and the potential for genetic discrimination. Research shows that many people at risk for genetic diseases avoid genetic testing because they fear that the results would make it difficult for them to obtain insurance or that the information might adversely affect their employability. Some of those who do seek genetic testing pay for it themselves and use aliases to prevent the results from becoming part of their health records. Fears about genetic discrimination have been reinforced by past practices. In the 1970s, some people who were identified as carriers of sickle-cell anemia (an autosomal recessive disorder that is common among African Americans) faced employment discrimination and had difficulty obtaining health insurance, in spite of the fact that carriers are healthy.</p>
