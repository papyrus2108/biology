<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZdN2S8J7SQ">The most widely studied prokaryotic organism and one of the best genetically characterized of all the species is the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0FyB4xZ38X">Escherichia coli</i>. Although some strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_IrYhzI8Hzn">E. coli</i> are toxic and cause disease, most are benign and reside naturally in the intestinal tracts of humans and other warm-blooded animals. <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RPuI2TP6Ef">E. coli</i> was first described by Theodore Escherich in 1885, but for many years, the assumption was that all bacteria reproduced only asexually and that genetic crosses were impossible. In 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum demonstrated that <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_x2Ikjgx2hL">E. coli</i> undergoes a type of sexual reproduction; their finding initiated the use of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_D2BmG7O63K">E. coli</i> as a model genetic organism. A year later, Lederberg published the first genetic map of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_zC74zLKp9L">E. coli</i> based on recombination frequencies, and in 1952, William Hays showed that mating between bacteria is asymmetrical, with one bacterium serving as genetic donor and the other as genetic recipient.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_o98LzsdjkK"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xCmfGzq4N6">Escherichia coli</i> is one of the true workhorses of genetics; its twofold advantage is rapid reproduction and small size. Under optimal conditions, this organism can reproduce every 20 minutes, and in a mere 7 hours, a single bacterial cell can give rise to more than 2 million descendants. One of the values of rapid reproduction is that enormous numbers of cells can be grown quickly, so even very rare mutations will appear in a short period. Consequently, numerous mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kGuZmCNtVa">E. coli</i>, affecting everything from colony appearance to drug resistance, have been isolated and characterized.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lEmbG5Krvn"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RLs9a3VNZ3">Escherichia coli</i> is easy to culture in the laboratory in a liquid medium (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FE0EIpsbVH" id="ben_9781319297145_T9vpgifIYw">Figure 9.1a</a>) or on a solid medium within petri plates (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FE0EIpsbVH" id="ben_9781319297145_fjYJZsQK8b">Figure 9.1b</a>). In liquid culture, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_py80O8NUpS">E. coli</i> cells will grow to a concentration of a billion cells per milliliter, and trillions of bacterial cells can be easily grown in a single test tube. When <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gA4sRLJwuX">E. coli</i> cells are diluted and spread onto the solid medium of a petri dish, individual bacteria reproduce asexually, giving rise to a concentrated clump of 10 million to 100 million genetically identical cells, called a colony. This colony formation makes it easy to isolate genetically pure strains of the bacteria.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_l4JIE5VgNw">The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_KeVms4iWj3">E. coli</i> genome is on a single chromosome and—compared with those of humans, mice, plants, and other multicellular organisms—is relatively small, consisting of 4,638,858 base pairs. If stretched out straight, the DNA molecule in the single <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_SRpwxuv3Cq">E. coli</i> chromosome would be 1.6 mm long, almost a thousand times as long as the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_p0NuXALKBj">E. coli</i> cell within which it resides (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_SsgwqKf0Id" id="ben_9781319297145_T8SwCFx3SR">Figure 11.1</a>). To accommodate this huge amount of DNA within the confines of a single cell, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_EJroX3eNKK">E. coli</i> chromosome is highly coiled and condensed. The information within the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_asdXHk01Ys">E. coli</i> chromosome is also compact, having little noncoding DNA between and within the genes and having few sequences for which there is more than one copy. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_S8UzKjytts">E. coli</i> genome contains an estimated 4300 genes, many of which have no known function. These “orphan genes” may play important roles in adapting to unusual environments, coordinating metabolic pathways, organizing the chromosome, or communicating with other bacterial cells. The haploid genome of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_x1Klmg9Y6t">E. coli</i> makes it easy to isolate mutations because there are no dominant genes at the same loci to suppress and mask recessive mutations.</p>

Under most conditions, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jCUYHc99se">E. coli</i> divides about once an hour, although in a richer medium containing sugars and amino acids, it will divide every 20 minutes. It normally reproduces through simple binary fission, in which the single chromosome of a bacterium replicates and migrates to opposite sides of the cell, followed by cell division, giving rise to two identical daughter cells (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_pAAeneOIyh" id="ben_9781319297145_wUBup1hiEl">Figure 2.5</a>). Mating between bacteria, called conjugation, is controlled by fertility genes normally located on the F plasmid (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_03.xhtml#page263" id="ben_9781319297145_lwFU94QDGx">p. 263</a>). In conjugation, one bacterium donates genetic material to another bacterium, followed by genetic recombination that integrates new alleles into the bacterial chromosome. Genetic material can also be exchanged between strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_frppAljf4b">E. coli</i> through transformation and transduction (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_cMju06KiOT" id="ben_9781319297145_rosIU7fqCx">Figure 9.7</a>).</p>

For example, in vitro translation systems contain within a test tube all the components necessary to translate the genetic information of a messenger RNA molecule into a polypeptide chain. Similarly, in vitro systems containing components from <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jAAnov5SpP">E. coli</i> cells allow transcription, replication, gene expression, and many other important genetic functions to be studied and analyzed under controlled laboratory conditions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_p8bgPyLXN8"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_cGnkzV3CtP">Escherichia coli</i> is also widely used in genetic engineering (recombinant DNA, see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_BEyU4ojCCT">Chapter 19</a>). Plasmids have been isolated from <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_pCItZ3sPjR">E. coli</i> and genetically modified to create effective vectors for transferring genes into bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Often, new genetic constructs (DNA sequences created in the laboratory) are assembled and cloned in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_eUwZedMPn3">E. coli</i> before transfer to other organisms. Methods have been developed to introduce specific mutations within <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_13ZaOl9QM0">E. coli</i> genes, so genetic analysis no longer depends on the isolation of randomly occurring mutations. New DNA sequences produced by recombinant DNA can be introduced by transformation into special strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PIUui9xtU5">E. coli</i> that are particularly efficient (competent) at taking up DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_fSvRANKmz7">The illustration shows two E. coli cells. The advantages are as follows: Small size; rapid reproduction, dividing every 20 minutes under optimal conditions; easy to culture in liquid medium or on petri plates; many mutants available; small genome; and numerous methods available for genetic engineering. Stats are as follows: Taxonomy: eubacteria; size: 1 to 2 micrometers in length; anatomy: single cell surrounded by cell wall with nucleoid region; habitat: Intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. Chromosome shows a scattered thread-like structure forming many spirals. Genome shows the following information: Chromosomes: 1 circular chromosome; amount of D N A: 4 point 64 million base pairs; number of genes: 4300; percentage of genes in common with humans: 8 percent; average gene size: 1000 base pairs; and genome sequenced in year: 19 97. Contributions to genetics are as follows: Gene regulation; molecular biology and biochemistry of genetic processes, such as replication, transcription, translation, and recombination; gene structure and organization in bacteria; workhorse of recombinant D N A; gene mutations. Life cycle is as follows: The life cycle starts with a bacterial cell with chromosome. It branches into two parts. The first part represents asexual reproduction and the second part represents genetic exchange. Bacterial chromosome replicates and the diagram shows a longer thread of chromosome than earlier. The chromosomes then separate into two parts and a constriction appears. Then, cell division takes place and two daughter cells are obtained. In the second part, conjugation occurs and an F-positive cell transmits F-factor to the F-negative cell. Transfer of genetic information takes place and two F-positive daughter cells are obtained.</p>
