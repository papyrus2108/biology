When a particular characteristic or disease is observed in a person, a geneticist often studies the family of that affected person by drawing a pedigree. Today, computer programs are often used to create and analyze pedigrees. These programs may calculate a variety of genetic parameters from pedigree, including measures of relatedness, inbreeding coefficients (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNqy757pBo" id="ben_9781319297145_ul20i00AFO">Chapter 25</a>), genotype predictions, genetic risk values, and estimates of linkage among genes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_pnbkjQ3xot" id="ben_9781319297145_zw5ogH2XLB">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

Unaffected individuals have uncolored shapes. For affected persons, the shape is filled in with red.

Multiple persons may be indicated by a number inside the shape rather than multiple shapes. A deceased person will have the shape crossed out with a slash. The proband, or the first affected family member coming to the attention of the geneticist, is indicated with the solid color and a capital P with an arrow pointing to the shape from a left side. A person of unknown sex who is proband may have multiple lines inside the shape rather than it being completely filled in. When a person has an unknown family history, there is a question mark over their corresponding symbol. Each generation is indicated by a roman numeral and each person in a generation is numbered. In a family with parents and three children out of which one is boy and two girls in birth order, a pedigree chart is drawn is as follows: Two blocks are present. One has Roman numeral 1 written on left and has a square and a circle connected by a horizontal line in between. From the line, a perpendicular line is drawn downwards to another block with roman numeral 2 written on left. The line divides into 3 branches that have labeled shapes at the end as follows: 1 square, 2 circle, and 3 circle. Adoption is denoted by square brackets enclosing the symbol. Dashed line represents adoptive parents and solid line represents biological parents. The lines between twins are angled downward and triangular in shape. For identical twins, an extra line is drawn between the lines, resulting in a shape that looks like an big A. Unknown twin status is designated with a question mark below the upside down V. Consanguinity or mating between related people is indicated by two parallel vertical lines drawn between the symbols.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_B7wrPJUQTG">The limited number of offspring in most human families means that clear Mendelian ratios are usually impossible to discern in a single pedigree. Pedigree analysis requires a certain amount of genetic sleuthing, based on recognizing patterns associated with different modes of inheritance. For example, autosomal dominant traits should appear with equal frequency in both sexes and should not skip generations, provided that the trait is fully penetrant (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_a6Z13hDTlQ" id="ben_9781319297145_Yx7ojd4XkO">Penetrance and Expressivity in Chapter 5</a>) and not sex-influenced (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_7QjIrcxpge" id="ben_9781319297145_wpZZgNzDZc">Sex-Influenced and Sex-Limited Characteristics in Chapter 5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Y3Z9zaESB6">Certain patterns may exclude the possibility of a particular mode of inheritance. For instance, a son inherits his X chromosome from his mother. If we observe that a trait is passed from father to son, we can exclude the possibility of X-linked inheritance. In the following sections, the traits discussed are assumed to be fully penetrant and rare.</p>

 <p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8MVO2ULlII">Autosomal recessive traits normally appear with equal frequency in both sexes (unless penetrance differs in males and females) and appear only when a person inherits two alleles for the trait, one from each parent. If the trait is uncommon, most parents of affected offspring are heterozygous and unaffected; consequently, the trait seems to skip generations (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_z6484sJj5T" id="ben_9781319297145_igWW8t51un"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_38HyX5lxwW">Figure 6.4</strong></a>). Frequently, a recessive allele may be passed on for a number of generations without the trait appearing in a pedigree. When both parents are heterozygous, approximately one-fourth of the offspring are expected to express the trait, but this ratio will not be obvious unless the family is large. In the rare event that both parents are affected by an autosomal recessive trait, all the offspring will be affected.</p>

Children with Tay–Sachs disease appear healthy at birth but become listless and weak at about 6 months of age. Gradually, their physical and neurological conditions worsen, leading to blindness, deafness, and eventually death at two to three years of age. The disease results from the accumulation of a lipid called G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_UjiB11h7zj">M2</sub> ganglioside in the brain.

Cholesterol is normally transported throughout the body in small soluble particles called lipoproteins (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ov4WnfcPtT" id="ben_9781319297145_nHRdFglsaE"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_GtW8cY3dUX">Figure 6.6</strong></a>). A principal lipoprotein in the transport of cholesterol is low-density lipoprotein (LDL). When an LDL molecule reaches a cell, it attaches to an LDL receptor, which then moves the LDL through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm, where it is broken down and its cholesterol is released for use by the cell.</p>

A caption reads, “An L D L particle attaches to an L D L receptor on the cell surface and moves into the cell.” The L D L particle then enters into the cell by forming a vesicle. Another caption reads, “In the cell, the L D L particle is broken down and cholesterol is released for use by the cell.” From this vesicle, two vesicles are formed. One vesicle has cholesterol and other molecules and the other has receptors for recycling. The receptors are again recycled and are attached back to the surface.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_n2b5ff5VCs">Familial hypercholesterolemia occurs when there is a defect in the gene that normally encodes the LDL receptor. The disease is usually considered an autosomal dominant disorder because heterozygotes are deficient in LDL receptors and have elevated blood levels of cholesterol, which lead <span aria-label="154" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" role="doc-pagebreak" title="154"/>to increased risk of coronary artery disease. People who are heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia have blood LDL levels that are twice the normal levels and usually have heart attacks by the age of 35.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VPc90vg7MN">Very rarely, a person inherits two defective alleles for the LDL receptor. Such individuals don’t make any functional LDL receptors; their blood cholesterol levels are more than six times the normal levels, and they may suffer a heart attack as early as age 2 and almost inevitably by age 20. Because homozygotes are more severely affected than heterozygotes, familial hypercholesterolemia is said to be incompletely dominant. However, homozygotes are rarely seen, and the common heterozygous form of the disease appears as a simple dominant trait in most pedigrees.</p>

First, these traits appear more frequently in males than in females because males need inherit only a single copy of the allele to display the trait, whereas females must inherit two copies of the allele, one from each parent, to be affected. Second, because a male inherits his X chromosome from his mother, affected males are usually born to unaffected mothers who carry an allele for the trait. Because the trait is passed from unaffected female to affected male to unaffected female, it tends to skip generations (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_boxm3IuGS8" id="ben_9781319297145_EAF3wJ0mMd">Figure 6.7</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_mECCqLsIQi">An example of an X-linked recessive trait in humans is hemophilia A, also called classic hemophilia. Hemophilia results from the absence of a protein necessary for blood to clot. The complex process of blood clotting consists of a cascade of reactions that includes more than 13 different clotting factors. For this reason, there are several types of clotting disorders, each due to a glitch in a different step of the clotting pathway.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8xiVSvMkvl">Hemophilia A results from abnormal or missing factor VIII, one of the proteins in the clotting cascade. The gene for factor VIII is located on the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome, so hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. People with hemophilia A bleed excessively; even small cuts and bruises can be life threatening. Spontaneous bleeding occurs in joints such as elbows, knees, and ankles, producing pain, swelling, and erosion of the bone. Fortunately, bleeding in people with hemophilia A can be controlled by administering concentrated doses of factor VIII. The inheritance of hemophilia A is illustrated by the family of Queen Victoria of England (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZFqjgvWeeX" id="ben_9781319297145_5QklArA62D"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_FjEwq2F48I">Figure 6.8</strong></a>).</p>

In contrast, affected women (if heterozygous) pass the trait to about half of their sons and about half of their daughters, as seen in the children of III-6 in the pedigree. As with X-linked recessive traits, a male inherits an X-linked dominant trait only from his mother; the trait is not passed from father to son. This fact is what distinguishes X-linked dominant inheritance from autosomal dominant inheritance, in which a male can inherit the trait from his father. A female, on the other hand, inherits an X chromosome from both her mother and her father, so females can receive an X-linked dominant trait from either parent.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vFwg7SLwqN">An example of an X-linked dominant trait in humans is hypophosphatemia, or familial vitamin-D-resistant rickets. People with this trait have features that superficially resemble those produced by rickets: bone deformities, stiff spines and joints, bowed legs, and mild growth deficiencies. This disorder, however, is resistant to treatment with vitamin D, which normally cures rickets. X-linked hypophosphatemia results from the defective transport of phosphate, especially in cells of the kidneys. People with this disorder excrete large amounts of phosphate in their urine, resulting in low levels of phosphate in the blood and reduced deposition of minerals in the bone. The disorder is treated with high doses of calcitriol (a hormonally active form of vitamin D) and phosphate. As is common with X-linked dominant traits, males with hypophosphatemia are often more severely affected than females.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aImmtvgW5z">To answer this question, we should consider each mode of inheritance and determine which, if any, we can eliminate. The trait appears only in males, so autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance are unlikely because traits with these modes appear equally in males and females. Additionally, autosomal dominance can be eliminated because some affected individuals do not have an affected parent.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QfrZKTxriV">The trait is observed only among males in this pedigree, which might suggest Y-linked inheritance. However, affected men should pass a Y-linked trait to all their sons, which is not the case here; II-6 is an affected man who has four unaffected male offspring. Therefore, we can eliminate Y-linked inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PQ2NsllxWm">X-linked dominance can be eliminated because affected men should pass an X-linked dominant trait on to all their female offspring, and II-6 has an unaffected daughter (III-9).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qqt8V8gqJo">X-linked recessive traits often appear more commonly in males, and affected males are usually born to unaffected female carriers; the pedigree shows this pattern of inheritance. If the disorder is an X-linked trait, about half the sons of a heterozygous carrier mother should be affected. II-3 and III-9 are suspected carriers, and about half of their male children (three of five) are affected. Another important <span aria-label="158" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" role="doc-pagebreak" title="158"/>characteristic of an X-linked recessive trait is that it is not passed from father to son. We observe no father-to-son transmission in this pedigree. X-linked recessive is therefore the most likely mode of inheritance.</p>

In 1976, researchers published the curious case of a woman who had two different blood types. Most of her red blood cells were type O, but a few cells were type A. In 1998, a 52-year-old woman needed a kidney transplant. When her three children were genetically tested to see if any of them might be a potential donor, two of the children had genotypes that could not have come from their mother, even though she had given birth to them. Further testing revealed that the mother actually had two different types of cells in her body: the genotype of her blood cells was different from that of her skin and some organs. These individuals, in which different cells of the body have different genetic constitutions, are referred to as

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_GRAFgc8g9z">Genetic mosaicism can arise from a number of different processes. Often, somatic mutations or errors in the separation of chromosomes during early development lead to genetically distinct groups of cells within the body. There can also be exchanges of cells and DNA between twins or between mother and child during pregnancy. Mosaicism was once thought to be rare, but the increasing use of DNA sequencing has revealed that it may be common. For example, in 2012, researchers sequenced skin cells and discovered that 30% of the cells contained genetic variants called copy-number variations (CNVs, see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_z0nLHQDxrE" id="ben_9781319297145_z630qEv9rY">Chapter 8</a>). Another study examined CNVs in diverse tissues from six people and also found major differences in CNVs, even within a single person.</p>
