<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Gb34FqMNnf">The central role of the ribosome in protein synthesis was recognized in the 1950s, and numerous aspects of its structure have been studied since then. Nevertheless, many aspects remained a mystery until detailed, three-dimensional reconstructions were completed. In 2009, the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas Steitz, and Ada Yonath for their research on the molecular structure of the ribosome.</p>

This center senses the fit between the codon on the mRNA and the anticodon on the incoming charged tRNA. Only tRNAs with the correct anticodon are bound tightly by the ribosome. These structural analyses indicate that peptide-bond formation occurs within the large ribosomal subunit and is carried out by the 23S rRNA molecule. These analyses also reveal that a tunnel connects the site of peptide-bond formation with the back of the ribosome; the growing polypeptide chain passes through this tunnel to the outside of the ribosome. The tunnel can accommodate about 35 amino acids of the growing polypeptide chain.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8O6exGZsrU">A common type of mutation is the alteration of a codon that specifies an amino acid to become a termination codon (called a nonsense mutation, see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_druJmSR46T" id="ben_9781319297145_U0ORPIzFt1">Chapter 18</a>). A nonsense mutation does not affect transcription, but translation ends prematurely when the termination codon is encountered. The resulting protein is truncated and often nonfunctional. Nonsense mutations often arise in eukaryotic transcription when one or more exons are skipped or improperly spliced. Improper splicing leads to the deletion or addition of nucleotides in the mRNA, which alters the reading frame and often introduces premature termination codons.</p>

The mechanism responsible for NMD is still poorly understood. In mammals, it appears to entail proteins that bind to exon–exon junctions. These exon-junction proteins may interact with enzymes that degrade the mRNA. One possibility is that the first ribosome to translate an mRNA (in the pioneer round of translation) removes the exon-junction proteins, thus protecting the mRNA from degradation. However, when the ribosome encounters a premature termination codon, the ribosome does not traverse the entire mRNA, and some of the exon-junction proteins are not removed, resulting in NMD. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay does not occur in bacteria. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_BMX5xDUWkW">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JjTQbjhWFy" id="ben_9781319297145_XtRz49KZRu">PROBLEM 39</a></strong></p>

It can also arise when transcription terminates prematurely, producing a <span aria-label="457" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page457" role="doc-pagebreak" title="457"/>truncated mRNA lacking a termination codon. In these cases, the ribosome reaches the end of the mRNA without encountering a termination codon, whereupon it stalls, still attached to the mRNA.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XvW7O6KqEb">The ribosome then resumes translation, switching from the original, aberrant mRNA to the mRNA part of tmRNA. It adds 10 amino acids encoded by the tmRNA and then reaches a termination codon at the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_joYmfjKGy6">′</sup> end of the tmRNA, which terminates translation and releases the ribosome. The added amino acids act as a tag that targets the incomplete polypeptide chain for degradation. Some evidence suggests that the tmRNA also targets the aberrant mRNA for degradation. How stalled ribosomes are recognized by the tmRNA is not clear, but this method is efficient at recycling stalled ribosomes and eliminating abnormal proteins that result from truncated transcription. Some bacteria have an alternative method for rescuing stalled ribosomes that utilizes proteins called alternative ribosome-rescue factors (Arfs). An alternative ribosome-rescue factor called ArfA binds to the A site of the ribosome and substitutes for the missing stop codon by recruiting release factor 2, which then brings about termination of translation.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rN7HMfSuSI">Many proteins must be modified after translation to become functional. Proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells often undergo alterations following translation, which are termed posttranslational modifications. A number of different types of modifications are possible. Some proteins are synthesized as part of larger precursor proteins that must be cleaved and trimmed by enzymes before the proteins can become functional. As mentioned earlier, the formyl group, or the entire methionine, may be removed from the amino end of a protein. Some proteins require the attachment of carbohydrates for activation. Amino acids within a protein may be modified: phosphates, carboxyl groups, and methyl groups are added to some amino acids. In eukaryotic cells, the amino end of a protein is often acetylated after translation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_f3dhP58do8">A common posttranslational modification in eukaryotes is the attachment of a protein called ubiquitin, which targets the protein for degradation. Another modification of some proteins is the removal of 15 to 30 amino acids, called the

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_084oI1LC0P">Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. To make an effective antibiotic, not just any poison will do: the trick is to kill the bacteria without harming the patient.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JOzvgCbhtE">Translation is frequently the target of antibiotics because it is essential to all living organisms and differs significantly between bacterial and eukaryotic cells. A number of antibiotics bind selectively to bacterial ribosomes and inhibit specific steps in translation but do not affect eukaryotic ribosomes. Tetracyclines, for instance, are a class of antibiotics that bind to the A site of a bacterial ribosome and block the entry of charged tRNAs, yet they have no effect on eukaryotic ribosomes. Neomycin binds to the ribosome near the A site and induces translational errors, probably by causing mistakes in the binding of charged tRNAs to the A site. Chloramphenicol binds to the large ribosomal subunit and blocks peptide-bond formation. Streptomycin binds to the small ribosomal subunit and inhibits initiation, and erythromycin blocks translocation. Although chloramphenicol and streptomycin are potent inhibitors of translation in bacteria, they do not inhibit translation in archaea.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MYDl44EzKI">The three-dimensional structure of puromycin resembles that of the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_GeOt7CuCJC">′</sup> end of a charged tRNA, which permits puromycin to enter the A site of a ribosome efficiently and inhibit the entry of tRNAs. A peptide bond can form between the puromycin molecule in the A site and an amino acid on the tRNA in the P site of the ribosome, but puromycin cannot bind to the P site, and translocation does not take place, blocking further elongation of the protein. Because tRNA structure is similar in all organisms, puromycin inhibits translation in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells; consequently, puromycin kills eukaryotic cells along with bacteria and is sometimes used in cancer therapy to destroy tumor cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CANRzTL0q7">Although these antibiotics act by blocking specific steps in translation, it is important to recognize that antibiotics may also have other effects that contribute to the killing of bacteria. Because different antibiotics block different steps in protein synthesis, antibiotics are frequently used to study protein synthesis.</p>
