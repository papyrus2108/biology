<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_9f0LsMmxfF">An important aspect of development is the death of cells. Cell death shapes many body parts in the course of development: it is responsible for the disappearance of a tadpole’s tail during metamorphosis and causes the removal of tissue between the digits to produce the human hand. Cell death is also used to eliminate dangerous cells that have escaped normal controls (see the section on mutations in cell cycle control genes and cancer in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qia1wFPBxu" id="ben_9781319297145_yF9gnX3WIh">Chapter 23</a>).</p>

In this process, a cell’s DNA is degraded, its nucleus and cytoplasm shrink, and blebbing occurs: the cell membrane bulges outward and breaks off into vesicles, taking some cytoplasm with it. These vesicles, and the cell itself, undergo phagocytosis by other cells without any leakage of cellular contents or damage to nearby cells (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_HdCqHc12Zy" id="ben_9781319297145_AQUrErW6FR"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_UKxYgMPHtq">Figure 22.17a</strong></a>). Cells that are injured, on the other hand, die by a relatively uncontrolled process called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_TYor2FrVqy">necrosis</i>. In this process, a cell swells and bursts, spilling its contents over neighboring cells and eliciting an inflammatory response (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_HdCqHc12Zy" id="ben_9781319297145_zNu6TMvJsr"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_uxDXA1bPSC">Figure 22.17b</strong></a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_gEpsfqge7K">Surprisingly, most cells are programmed to undergo apoptosis and will survive only if the internal death program is continuously held in check. Apoptosis is highly regulated and depends on numerous <span aria-label="689" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page689" role="doc-pagebreak" title="689"/>signals from inside and outside the cell. Geneticists have identified a number of genes that have roles in various stages of the regulation of apoptosis. Some of these genes encode enzymes called 
<dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="ben_9781319297145_xkp1zjBWwy"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_glossary.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_3axBb83k60" id="ben_9781319297145_vxuhFflMxo" role="doc-glossref">caspases</a></dfn>, which cleave other proteins at specific sites (after aspartic acid). Each caspase is synthesized as a large, inactive precursor (a procaspase) that is activated by cleavage, often by another caspase. When one caspase is activated, it cleaves other procaspases, which trigger even more caspase activity. The resulting cascade of caspase activity eventually cleaves proteins essential to cell function, such as those supporting the nuclear membrane and cytoskeleton. Caspases also cleave a protein that normally keeps an enzyme that degrades DNA (DNase) in an inactive form. Cleavage of this protein activates DNase and leads to the breakdown of cellular DNA, which eventually leads to cell death.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_KcGEIsWQza">Procaspases and other proteins required for cell death are continuously produced by healthy cells, so the potential for cell suicide is always present. A number of different signals can trigger apoptosis; for instance, infection by a virus can activate immune-system cells to secrete substances onto an infected cell, causing that cell to undergo apoptosis. This process is believed to be a defense mechanism designed to prevent the reproduction and spread of viruses. Similarly, DNA damage can induce apoptosis and thus prevent the replication of mutated sequences. Damage to mitochondria or the accumulation of a misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum also stimulate programmed cell death.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DNpP5L9NJQ">In addition to factors that induce apoptosis, there are other proteins called survival factors that prevent inappropriate or premature cell death by actively suppressing the process of apoptosis. Survival factors often act by inhibiting caspases and other proteins involved in apoptosis. Programmed cell death is thus regulated by the balance between pro-apoptosis factors that stimulate apoptosis and survival factors that hold it in check.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_F7CgoXlxDZ">Apoptosis plays a critical role in development. As animals develop, excess cells are often produced and then later culled by apoptosis to produce the proper number of cells required for an organ or a tissue. In some cases, whole structures are created that are later removed by apoptosis. For example, early mammalian embryos develop both male and female reproductive ducts, but the Wolffian ducts degenerate in females and the Mullerian ducts degenerate in males. Apoptosis also plays an important role in the development of immunity (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ALEZZf21Yw" id="ben_9781319297145_jO3z496GPK">Section 22.6</a>), in which lymphocytes that recognize the body’s own cells normally undergo apoptosis so that they do not attack self-tissues.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7ovDtP04NT">During embryonic development in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_a4vsu71Auc">Drosophila</i>, large numbers of cells die. Three genes in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_9ghsXIQWrV">Drosophila</i> activate caspases that are essential for apoptosis: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_LC0BXQczn9">reaper</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wQkjpOSaEx">rpr</i>), <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_I6LcbqGDgk">grim</i>, and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_yDdrI8Eu5d">head involution defective</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_v2NUgSwyCI">hid</i>). Embryos possessing a deletion that removes all three genes exhibit no apoptosis and die in the course of embryogenesis with an excess of cells. Numerous other genes also affect the process of apoptosis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pgStNeqnZ6">Apoptosis is also crucial in metamorphosis, the process by which larval structures are transformed into adult structures. For example, the large salivary glands of larval fruit flies regress during metamorphosis. The hormone ecdysone stimulates metamorphosis, including the onset of apoptosis. Ecdysone induces the expression of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_K9SCbsctaR">rpr</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_KYE1CfTrwS">hid</i> and inhibits the expression of other genes, which then leads to apoptosis of salivary gland cells.</p>
