<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_KaQJCOdA9Q">What is a gene? As noted in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lgF7rF7G1D" id="ben_9781319297145_XN3hhBW1FC">Chapter 3</a>, the definition of a gene often changes as we explore different aspects of heredity. A gene was defined in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lgF7rF7G1D" id="ben_9781319297145_2MxrRFkvOv">Chapter 3</a> as an inherited factor that determines a characteristic. This definition may have seemed vague because it says only what a gene does, not what a gene is. Nevertheless, this definition was appropriate at the time because our focus was on how genes influence the inheritance of traits. We did not have to consider the physical nature of the gene in learning the rules of inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hxN4SxWTen">Knowing something about the chemical structure of DNA and the process of transcription now enables us to be more precise about what a gene is. <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xua4LZ2D44" id="ben_9781319297145_viU4Xya7mp">Chapter 10</a> described how genetic information is encoded in the base sequence of DNA: a gene consists of a set of DNA nucleotides. But how many nucleotides constitute a gene, and how is the information in those nucleotides organized? In 1902, Archibald Garrod correctly suggested that genes encode proteins. Proteins are made of amino acids, so a gene contains nucleotides that specify amino acids. Therefore, for many years, the working definition of a gene was a set of nucleotides that specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein. As geneticists learned more about the structure of genes, however, it became clear that this concept of a gene was an oversimplification.</p>

The concept of colinearity suggests that the number of nucleotides in a gene should be proportional to the number of amino acids in the protein encoded by that gene. In a general sense, this concept is true for genes found in bacterial cells and in many viruses, although these genes are slightly longer than would be expected if colinearity were strictly applied because the mRNAs encoded by the genes contain sequences at their ends that do not specify amino acids. At first, eukaryotic genes and proteins were also assumed to be colinear, but there were hints that eukaryotic gene structure is fundamentally different. Eukaryotic cells were found to contain far more DNA than is required to encode proteins (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_nK76TuFGN8">Chapter 11</a>). Furthermore, many large RNA molecules observed in the nucleus were absent from the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear RNAs undergo some type of change before they are exported to the cytoplasm.</p>

Researchers observed four coding sequences in a gene from a eukaryote-infecting virus that were interrupted by nucleotides that did not specify amino acids. This discovery was made when the viral DNA was hybridized with the mRNA transcribed from it and the hybridized structure was examined using an electron microscope (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_uQBCTLqfFi" id="ben_9781319297145_0BS5hCFMFC"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_q5pqJfnEvN">Figure 14.2</strong></a>). The DNA was clearly much longer than the mRNA because regions of DNA looped out from the hybridized molecules. These regions of DNA contained nucleotide sequences that were absent from the coding nucleotides in the mRNA. Many other examples of interrupted genes were subsequently discovered; it quickly became apparent that most eukaryotic genes consist of stretches of coding and noncoding nucleotides.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_W7tTlsBXE0">Introns are common in eukaryotic genes but are rare in bacterial genes. For a number of years after their discovery, introns were thought to be entirely absent from prokaryotic genomes, but they have now been observed in archaea, bacteriophages, and even some bacteria. Introns are present in mitochondrial and chloroplast genes as well as in the nuclear genes of eukaryotes. Among eukaryotic genomes, the sizes and numbers of introns appear to be directly related to organismal complexity: yeast genes contain only a few short introns, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7aK9GqH2uU">Drosophila</i> introns are longer and more numerous, and most vertebrate genes are interrupted by long introns. <span aria-label="408" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page408" role="doc-pagebreak" title="408"/>Different classes of eukaryotic genes—those that encode rRNA, tRNA, and proteins—may contain introns. The numbers and sizes of introns vary widely: some eukaryotic genes have no introns, whereas others may have more than 60; intron length varies from fewer than 200 nucleotides to more than 50,000. Introns tend to be longer than exons, and most eukaryotic genes contain more noncoding nucleotides than coding nucleotides.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_3kdW1q6xuL">Geneticists have long debated the evolutionary origin of introns. One idea, called the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZwiDHtB1yh">intron late hypothesis</i>, proposes that introns were absent from ancient organisms but were later acquired by eukaryotes. Another idea, termed the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_zil212fZWc">intron early hypothesis</i>, suggests that early ancestors of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes possessed introns that were later lost by prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes. Evidence suggests that introns have been lost <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_oqlcVcu6sv">and</i> gained over evolutionary time. Many researchers now assume that the earliest eukaryotes possessed introns because divergent eukaryotes have introns in the same positions in their genes, suggesting that these introns were present in the ancestors of all eukaryotes.</p>

For now, we should keep in mind two general characteristics of the splicing process: (1) the splicing of all pre-mRNA introns takes place in the nucleus; and (2) the order of exons in DNA is usually maintained in the spliced RNA; that is, the coding sequences of a gene may be split up, but they are not usually jumbled up. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_RYt5muT7JZ">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_09.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2PCI8UAppx" id="ben_9781319297145_zVhCLQaSdB">PROBLEM 22</a></strong></p>

The numbers and sizes of introns vary from gene to gene. Introns are common in eukaryotic genes but uncommon in bacterial genes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_jGDeON9nXB">How does the presence of introns affect our concept of a gene? To define a gene as a sequence of nucleotides that encodes amino acids in a protein no longer seems appropriate because this definition excludes introns, which do not specify amino acids. This definition also excludes the nucleotides that encode the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_IFDSMygojR">′</sup> and 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_bLza6Se9id">′</sup> ends of an mRNA molecule, which, as we will see, are required for translation but do not encode amino acids. And defining a gene in these terms also excludes sequences that specify rRNA, tRNA, and other RNAs that do not encode proteins. Given our current understanding of DNA structure and function, we need a more precise definition of a gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_diWOwojhZn">Many geneticists have broadened the concept of a gene to include all sequences in DNA that are transcribed into a single RNA molecule. Defined this way, a gene includes all exons, all introns, and those sequences at the beginning and end of the RNA that are not translated into protein. This definition also includes DNA sequences that encode rRNAs, tRNAs, and other types of non-messenger RNA. Some geneticists have expanded the definition of a gene even further to include the entire transcription unit—the promoter, the RNA-coding region, and the terminator. However, new evidence now calls into question even this definition. Research suggests that much of the genome is transcribed into RNA, although it is unclear what, if anything, much of this RNA does. What <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vC7GK0461x">is</i> certain is that the process of transcription is more complex than formerly thought, and defining a gene as a sequence that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is not as straightforward as formerly thought. The more we learn about the nature of genetic information, the more elusive the definition of a gene seems to become.</p>
