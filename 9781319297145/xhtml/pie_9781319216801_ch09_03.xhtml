The second caption reads, Strands separate and replication takes place in both directions, eventually producing 2 circular D N A molecules. Another forward arrow labeled replication points to the D N A with its strands open up at the ori and newly synthesized D N A is shown next to the template D N A. Another forward arrow labeled separation of daughter plasmids points to two double-stranded circular daughter D N A molecules, each with a new strand and an old strand.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Pvaaql54Oa">Bacteria can be studied in the laboratory by growing them on liquid or solid media. A typical bacterial genome consists of a single circular chromosome that contains several million base pairs, although some bacteria have smaller genomes. Bacterial genes may be present on plasmids, which are small, circular DNA molecules that replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome.</p>
