<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_FfbA5lw7Du">As we have seen in our consideration of animal and plant development, a basic principle of developmental biology is that every somatic cell carries an identical set of genetic information, and no genes are lost in development. Although this principle holds for most cells, there are some important exceptions, one of which concerns genes that encode immune function in vertebrates. In the development of immunity, individual segments of certain genes are rearranged into different combinations, producing immune-system cells that contain different genetic information and are each adapted to attack one particular foreign substance. This rearrangement and loss of genetic material is key to the power of our immune systems to protect us against almost any conceivable foreign substance.</p>

The immune system is remarkable in its ability to recognize an almost unlimited number of potential antigens.

Occasionally, the ability to make this distinction breaks down, and the body produces an immune reaction to its own antigens, resulting in an

Two captions read, “Lymphocytes originate from stem cells in the bone marrow” and “B cells mature in the bone marrow.” The B cell then develops into a plasma cell which then gives rise to Y-shaped antibodies. Another caption reads, “When B cells encounter antigens, they mature into plasma cells, which secrete antibodies that bind to the antigen (humoral immunity).” The second branch shows the thymus. An arrow from lymphocyte stem cell inside the bone marrow leads to a cell in the thymus. This cell matures inside the thymus. It shows a T-cell.

To illustrate clonal selection, let’s imagine that a foreign protein enters the body. Only a few lymphocytes in the pool will be specific for this particular foreign antigen. When one of these lymphocytes encounters the foreign antigen and binds to it, that lymphocyte is stimulated to divide. The lymphocyte proliferates rapidly, producing a large population of genetically identical cells—a clone—each of which is specific for that particular antigen.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LQaEV89Wb6">The light chains of an immunoglobulin are of two basic types: kappa chains and lambda chains. An immunoglobulin molecule can have two kappa chains or two lambda chains, but it cannot have one of each type. Both the light and the heavy chains have a variable region at one end and a constant region at the other end; the variable regions of different immunoglobulin molecules vary in their amino acid sequence, whereas the constant regions of different immunoglobulins are similar in sequence. The variable regions of both light and heavy chains make up the antigen-binding regions and specify the type of antigen to which the antibody can bind. The constant regions of the heavy chains at the base of the Y-shaped antibody help to determine the function of the antibody and its ability to communicate with other parts of the immune system. For example, these constant regions are important in the uptake and destruction of antigen-bound antibodies by phagocytic cells.</p>

Antibodies are proteins, so the amino acid sequences of all 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_mWOqVuf0vi">11</sup> potential antibodies must be encoded in the human genome. However, there are fewer than 1 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_MFTRwuLwF9">5</sup> genes in the human genome and, in fact, only about 3 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_gMhoPWlGIx">9</sup> total base pairs—so how can this huge diversity of antibodies be encoded?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MNNs58dk2T">The answer lies in the fact that antibody genes are composed of several distinct types of segments. There are a number of copies of each type of segment, each differing slightly from the others. In the maturation of a lymphocyte, segments of each type are joined together to create an immunoglobulin gene. The particular copy of each segment used is random, and because there are multiple copies of each type, there are many possible combinations of the segments. A limited number of segments can therefore encode a huge diversity of antibodies.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TcenG15iNL">To illustrate this process of antibody assembly, let’s consider the immunoglobulin light chains. Kappa and lambda chains are encoded by separate genes on different chromosomes.

Each of the hairpin loops are stabilized with a disulfide bond and the top of the structure looks like a pincher. The region of the protein going through the lipid bilayer up to the first hairpin loop is labeled the constant region. The top loop and pincher are labeled variable region.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_oOkLfW49AT">The genes that encode the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell receptor are organized much like those that encode the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins: each gene is made up of segments that undergo somatic recombination before the gene is transcribed. For example, the human gene for the alpha chain initially consists of 44 to 46 <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_NVzK49nDLJ">V</i> gene segments, 50 <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jbrszHGH9e">J</i> gene segments, and a single <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_618TOtwvyA">C</i> gene segment. These gene segments undergo somatic recombination similar to that in antibody genes; the process also requires RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. The organization of the gene for the beta chain is similar, except that it also contains <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_r1nGo9ZjIN">D</i> gene segments. Alpha and beta chains combine randomly, and there is junctional diversity, but there is no evidence for somatic hypermutation in T-cell-receptor genes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UwsG7JTkOJ">When tissues are transferred from one vertebrate species to another, or even from one member to another within a species, the transplanted tissues are usually rejected by the host animal. The results of early studies demonstrated that this graft rejection is due to an immune response that takes place when antigens on the surface of cells of the grafted tissue are detected and attacked by T cells in the host animal. The antigens that elicit graft rejection are referred to as histocompatibility antigens, and they are encoded by a cluster of genes called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).</p>

The reason for this requirement is not clear; it may reserve T cells for action against pathogens that have invaded cells. When a foreign body, such as a virus, is ingested by a macrophage or another cell, partly digested pieces of the foreign body, containing antigens, are displayed on the cell’s surface complexed with MHC molecules (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_9wgUoGpyr2" id="ben_9781319297145_Sdxha3lAmc"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_k4ol6JvUtZ">Figure 22.25</strong></a>). A cell infected with a virus may also express viral antigens on its surface. Through their T-cell receptors, T cells bind to both the histocompatibility antigen and the foreign antigen and secrete substances that either destroy the antigen-containing cell, activate other B and T cells, or do both.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_axEOWWlSBu">The MHC genes are among the most variable genes known: there are more than 100 different alleles for some MHC loci. Because each person possesses five or more MHC loci and because many alleles are possible at each locus, no two people (with the exception of identical twins) produce the same set of histocompatibility antigens. The variation in histocompatibility antigens provides each of us with a unique identity for our own cells, which allows our immune systems to distinguish self from nonself. This variation is also the cause of rejection in organ transplants.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Fy4Djlivsk">For a person with a seriously impaired organ, a transplant operation may offer the only hope of survival. Successful transplantation requires more than the skills of a surgeon; it also requires a genetic match between the patient and the person donating the organ. The fate of transplanted tissue depends largely on the type of antigens present on the surface of its cells. Because foreign tissues are usually rejected by the host, the successful transplantation of tissues between different people is very difficult. Tissue rejection can be partly inhibited by drugs that interfere with cellular immunity. Unfortunately, this treatment can create serious problems for transplant patients because they may have difficulty fighting off common pathogens and may thus die of infection. The only other option for controlling the immune reaction is to carefully match the donor and the recipient, maximizing their genetic similarities.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_CZ6YDmqf4o">The tissue antigens that elicit the strongest immune reaction are the very ones used by the immune system to mark its own cells: those encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. In humans, the MHC spans a region of more than 3 million base pairs on chromosome 6 and has many alleles, providing different MHC antigens on the cells of each person and allowing the immune system to recognize foreign cells. The severity of an immune rejection of a transplanted organ depends on the number of MHC antigens on the cells of the transplanted tissue that fail to match those of the recipient. The ABO red-blood-cell antigens are also important because they elicit a strong immune reaction. The ideal donor is the patient’s own identical twin, who will have exactly the same MHC and ABO antigens. Unfortunately, most patients don’t have an identical twin. The next-best donor is a sibling with the same MHC and ABO antigens. If a sibling is not available, donors from the general population are considered. An attempt is made to match as many of the MHC antigens of the donor and recipient as possible, and immunosuppressive drugs are used to control rejection due to the mismatches. The long-term success of transplants depends on the closeness of the match. Survival rates after kidney transplants (the most successful of the major organ transplants) increase from 63% with zero or one MHC match to 90% with four matches.</p>

In the future, it may be possible to create pluripotent stem cells from a person’s adult cells, then grow those cells into tissues or organs that could be transplanted back into the same person. Such cells would have the same MHC antigens as the original cell, avoiding the immune rejection that occurs with transplants between different people.</p>
