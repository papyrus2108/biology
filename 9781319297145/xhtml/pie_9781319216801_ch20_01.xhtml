<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_340fD8XHeV">One of the great mysteries of life is how many species inhabit the Earth. Scientists estimate that there are at least 10–15 million eukaryotic species and perhaps trillions of bacteria and archaea, but only about 2.3 million species have actually been described. Of these, fewer than 15,000—mostly bacteria, archaea, and fungi—have had their genomes completely or partially sequenced. Those sequenced genomes have provided tremendously valuable information that has advanced medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and the study of evolution. In spite of these accomplishments, much of the world’s biodiversity remains unknown.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Vqfn2NOBUD">Many of the Earth’s unknown organisms may soon disappear. Today, much of the world’s biodiversity is threatened by habitat loss, pollution, climate change, exploitation, and other human activities. Scientists estimate that many of the world’s species are in decline and perhaps a third are approaching extinction. By 2050, up to 50% of the world’s species may become extinct. Humans depend on wild species as sources of food, medicines, and materials, as well as to generate ecosystem services that give rise to clean water and air. The consequences of losing large amounts of our biodiversity are unknown but potentially catastrophic.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ozDfIlOxbn">These threats have intensified efforts to find, identify, and study the Earth’s biodiversity. Toward this end, scientists from around the world launched the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) in 2018, with the audacious goal of sequencing all eukaryotic species found on Earth within the next 10 years. The overall aim of EBP is to “revise and reinvigorate our understanding of biology and evolution.” Within this broad framework are several more specific goals, including better understanding of the evolutionary relationships of all known organisms, discovering new species, clarifying how human activities affect species, and discovering new medicines and other useful products.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BhRHqYdkSn">Because a parallel project—the Earth Microbiome Project—was already underway to sequence the world’s microbial diversity, the leaders of EBP decided to focus on eukaryotic species. In 2017, there were only about 2500 eukaryotic species whose genomes had been completely or partially sequenced. Several research organizations have begun to sequence groups of eukaryotic organisms (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_VgmwOBE2I0"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_U05qTd98wD" id="ben_9781319297145_fpmgO30l7R">Table 20.1</a></strong>). For example, the G10K project seeks to sequence all vertebrate genomes, and the 10KP project is sequencing 10,000 plant genomes. The leaders of EBP hope to work with and expand the efforts of these different groups, creating a coordinated global program to sequence and understand all forms of eukaryotic life.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EVZlAba0aJ"><span aria-label="616" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page616" role="doc-pagebreak" title="616"/>The EBP’s plan is to sequence approximately 1.5 million known eukaryotic species and collect environmental DNA samples to discover unknown species. In the first phase of the project, researchers will carry out sequencing of at least one representative species from each of the 9000 eukaryotic families, creating high-quality reference genomes for these organisms. Next, they will conduct lower-resolution sequencing of at least one species from each of the 150,000 known genera. In the final phase of the project, researchers will carry out low-resolution sequencing of all remaining previously known and newly discovered species, the genome sequences of which can then be improved by comparing them to the high-quality reference genomes created in phase I. The projected cost of the project is approximately $4.7 billion, which is actually less in today’s dollars than the cost of the original sequencing of the human genome. Carrying out the goals of EBP will require coordination among thousands of scientists worldwide. The organizers envision that numerous citizen-scientists will also participate by collecting and cataloging of specimens to be sequenced.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_U3pXlLqFmy">In recent years, the cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically, so that an entire species genome can be sequenced for less than $1000. Leaders of the EBP believe that sequencing costs will continue to drop, making the project economically possible. One of the biggest hurdles, and perhaps the biggest expense, will be the collection of samples of all known species. Another challenge will be sequencing an estimated 140,000 species of protists, algae, and other single-celled eukaryotes, but recent advances in single-cell sequencing suggest that this is feasible. Regardless of whether the EBP reaches its goal of sequencing all eukaryotic species by 2028, thousands of eukaryotic genomes will no doubt be sequenced, greatly enriching our understanding of the abundant and beautiful life that surrounds us.</p>

The field of genomics is at the cutting edge of modern biology; information resulting from research in this field has made significant contributions to human health, agriculture, and numerous other areas. It has provided gene sequences necessary for producing medically important proteins through recombinant DNA technology. Comparisons of genome sequences from different organisms are also leading to a better understanding of evolution and the history of life. Genomics provides the potential for manipulating genomes, or even creating genomes from scratch.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pe4S2mqcPy">We begin this chapter by examining genetic and physical maps and methods for sequencing entire genomes. Next, we explore functional genomics—how genes are identified in genome sequences and how their functions are defined. The sequence of a genome by itself is of limited use, and now that the sequencing of genomes has become routine, much of genomics is focused on deciphering the functions of the sequences that are obtained. We also discuss how genome sequences and organization vary among organisms and how genomes evolve. In the final section of the chapter, we consider proteomics, the study of the complete set of proteins found in a cell.</p>
