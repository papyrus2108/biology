<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_YymyVwKxrO">Because mutations often have detrimental effects, they are frequently studied by geneticists. These studies have included the development of tests to determine the mutagenic properties of chemical compounds and the investigation of human populations tragically exposed to high levels of radiation.</p>

Many natural products are also potentially carcinogenic. One method for testing the cancer-causing potential of substances is to administer them to laboratory animals (rats or mice) and compare the incidence of cancer in the treated animals with that in the control animals. Unfortunately, these tests are time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the ability of a substance to cause cancer in rodents is not always indicative of its effect on humans. After all, we aren’t rats!</p>

Ames proposed that mutagenesis in bacteria could serve as an indicator of carcinogenesis in humans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wgPlrb98ZG">The Ames test uses auxotrophic strains of the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_9yoxZ2jzRd">Salmonella typhimurium</i> with traits that make them particularly susceptible to mutagens. These strains have defects in the lipopolysaccharide coat, which normally protects the bacteria from chemicals in the environment, and their DNA-repair systems have been inactivated. A recent version of the test (called Ames II) uses several auxotrophic strains that detect different types of base substitutions. Other strains detect different types of frameshift mutations.</p>

Different dilutions of a chemical to be tested are added to the bacteria and plates inoculated with the bacteria. The number of mutated bacterial colonies that appear on each plate is compared with the number that appear on control plates with no chemical (i.e., that arose through spontaneous mutation). Any chemical that significantly increases the number of colonies appearing on a treated plate is mutagenic and probably also carcinogenic.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UNXhYzWdPV">The Ames test has been applied to thousands of chemicals and commercial products. An early demonstration of its usefulness was the discovery in 1975 that many hair dyes sold in the United States at that time contained compounds that were mutagenic to bacteria. These compounds were then removed from most hair dyes.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vjlHeojYly">On August 6, 1945, toward the end of World War II, a high-flying American airplane dropped a single atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. The explosion devastated an area of the city measuring 4.5 square miles, killed between 90,000 and 140,000 people, and injured almost as many (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_8ItHl2ad2J"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EscLYSy16O" id="ben_9781319297145_3cRkVqjnQa">Figure 18.24</a></strong>). Three days later, the United States dropped another atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki, this time destroying an area measuring 1.5 square miles and killing between 60,000 and 80,000 people. Huge amounts of radiation were released during these explosions, and many people were exposed.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qxfiJQHQzK">After the war, a joint Japanese–U.S. effort was made to study the biological effects of radiation exposure on the survivors of the atomic blasts and their children. Somatic mutations were assessed by studying radiation sickness and cancer among the survivors; germ-line mutations were <span aria-label="545" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page545" role="doc-pagebreak" title="545"/>assessed by looking at birth defects, chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations in children born to people who had been exposed to radiation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_b6AMQIKOxS">Geneticist James Neel and his colleagues examined almost 19,000 children of people who were within 2000 meters (1.2 miles) of the center of the atomic blast at Hiroshima or Nagasaki, along with a similar number of children whose parents did not receive radiation exposure. Radiation doses were estimated for a child’s parents on the basis of careful assessment of the parents’ location, posture, and position at the time of the blast. A blood sample was collected from each child, and gel electrophoresis was used to investigate amino acid substitutions in 28 proteins. When rare variants were detected, blood samples from the child’s parents were also analyzed to establish whether the variant was an inherited or a new mutation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_GEH8MFncrH">Of a total of 289,868 genes examined by Neel and his colleagues, only one mutation was found in the children of exposed parents; no gene mutations were found in the control group. From these findings, a mutation rate of 3.4 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_RmCdc62ZFf">−6</sup> was estimated for the children whose parents were exposed to the blasts, which is within the range of spontaneous mutation rates observed for other eukaryotes. Neel and his colleagues also examined the frequency of chromosome mutations, the frequency of aneuploidy, and the sex ratios of children born to exposed parents. There was no evidence in any of these assays for increased mutations among the children of the people who were exposed to radiation from the atomic explosions, suggesting that germ-line mutations were not elevated.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FuXjbEywOL">Animal studies clearly show that radiation causes germ-line mutations, so why was there no apparent increase in germ-line mutations among the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? The exposed parents did exhibit an increased incidence of leukemia and other types of cancers, so somatic mutations were clearly induced. The answer to the question is not known, but the lack of germ-line mutations may be due to the fact that those people who received the largest radiation doses died soon after the blasts. Additional insights into the genetic effects of radiation have come from studies of people exposed to radiation in the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 and other nuclear accidents, as well as to radiation used in medicine and industry.</p>
