<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_J1iajszKxI">DNA is a heavily used single-lane highway, in which DNA and RNA polymerases race at breakneck speeds, carrying out the vital processes of replication and transcription. And like cars traveling a single-lane road, conflicts and collisions are inevitable. How do cells avoid these conflicts and deal with collisions?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Wk1DxsEO2j">As we discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_l3DG8meyw8" id="ben_9781319297145_yIUGTmrKrL">Chapter 12</a>, replication is the mechanism by which new DNA molecules are synthesized using single-stranded DNA templates through semiconservative replication. DNA synthesis is integral to cell division: before a cell can divide, it must copy its entire genome so that each cell resulting from division receives a complete set of genetic instructions. Transcription, discussed in this chapter, is equally important. It is the first step that uses the coding instructions in the DNA to create the traits of an organism, through the copying of DNA sequences into an RNA molecule.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tA2aQBN4aH">Both replication and transcription require reading DNA polynucleotide strands. Although they begin at different places (replication begins at origins and transcription starts at promoters), both processes move in the same 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_gHwdAejf8N">′</sup>→3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_7KdhNBHcRw">′</sup> direction and can take place on either DNA strand, so encounters between DNA and RNA polymerases are sure to occur. These enzymes travel at remarkable speeds: replication in bacteria takes place at 1000 nucleotides per second; transcription is slower, but still incredibly fast, occurring at about 40 nucleotides per second. If these two processes meet head on, catastrophic collisions occur. Even when traveling in the same direction, differences in the speed of replication and transcription lead to rear-end crashes, like collisions between cars traveling at 10 mph and others traveling at 250 mph, all on the same single-lane road.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_AoSlPVRqnw">Head-on collisions between DNA and RNA polymerases usually bring a halt to replication and cause the premature termination of transcription. Replication must then be restarted for the entire genome to be copied. Similarly, transcription of individual genes must be reinitiated. Collisions also lead to DNA breaks and mutations, which cause genetic diseases, cancer, and other problems. Because of these negative consequences, cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to avoid, tolerate, and fix collisions between replication and transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_e9dVDrMhGf">In bacteria, replication usually begins at a single origin, occurs continuously on both strands, and is not segregated in time from transcription, so conflicts between the two processes are common. Many bacteria have evolved in a simple way to avoid head-on collisions: highly transcribed and essential genes are transcribed in the same direction that replication occurs, so head-on clashes are avoided. For example, in the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_DMcddjXlXO">Bacillus subtilis</i>, 94% of essential genes are transcribed in the same direction that replication occurs. Although codirectional replication and transcription avoid head-on collisions, this does not prevent rear-end wrecks, as the faster replication complexes overtake and ram into the slower-moving transcription enzymes. To deal with crashes, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to restart replication forks stalled by collisions, remove transcription complexes blocked by collisions, and repair DNA breaks and mutations resulting from collisions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tbNeHroKXf">For many years, researchers assumed that collisions would be less common in eukaryotic cells. Replication in eukaryotes is restricted to S phase (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lpPoBBElt3" id="ben_9781319297145_Wsrc8x6RdW">Chapter 2</a>), allowing transcription to occur without risk of colliding with replication complexes during other phases of the cell cycle. Also, the speeds of replication and transcription complexes in eukaryotes are more similar, reducing the risk of rear-end collisions. Nevertheless, research now shows that collisions between replication and transcription do occur in eukaryotes, and eukaryotes, like bacteria, have evolved mechanisms to avoid and correct damage caused by collisions. For example, gene expression that must take place in S phase is controlled so that transcription occurs in early S phase for genes that are replicated in late S phase, and vice versa. Key to the controlling conflicts between replication and transcription is the efficient and highly organized manner in which transcription occurs (discussed in this chapter) and the careful control of gene expression (discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch16_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNK2N04MLy" id="ben_9781319297145_o05csnMeH6">Chapters 16</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_x628CDWyOM">17</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_kBZaEeCfic">Collisions between replication and transcription complexes are just one of the many challenges created by the need to faithfully transcribe a DNA template into an RNA molecule. This chapter is about the process of transcription, the first step in the pathway of information transfer from DNA (genotype) to protein (phenotype). Transcription is a complex process that requires a DNA template, precursors to RNA nucleotides, and a number of protein components. As we examine the stages of transcription, try to keep all the details in perspective and focus on understanding how they relate to the overall purpose of transcription: the selective synthesis of an RNA molecule.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VARDp09b7q">This chapter begins with a brief review of RNA structure and a discussion of the different classes of RNA. We then consider the major components required for transcription. Finally, we explore the process of transcription. At several points in the text, we pause to consider some general principles that emerge.</p>
