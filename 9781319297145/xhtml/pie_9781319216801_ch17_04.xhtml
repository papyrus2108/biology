<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_DZHU7KkTw0">We have just considered one level at which gene expression is controlled: the alteration of chromatin and DNA structure. We now turn to another important level of control: control through the binding of proteins to DNA sequences that affect transcription. Transcription is an important level of control in eukaryotic cells, and its control requires a number of different types of proteins and regulatory elements.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_t5ZAF0Jly4">Some regulatory promoters contain sequences that are bound by transcription factors that lower the rate of transcription. Unlike repressors in bacteria, most eukaryotic repressors do not directly block RNA polymerase. These repressors may compete with other transcription factors that activate transcription for binding sites on the DNA: when a site is occupied by the activator, transcription is activated, but if a repressor occupies that site, there is no activation. Alternatively, a repressor may bind to sites near an activating transcription factor and prevent it from contacting the basal transcription apparatus. A third mechanism of repressor action is direct interference with the assembly of the basal transcription apparatus, thereby blocking the initiation of transcription.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_nXuJ1j6jqE">An example of a transcription factor influencing gene expression is GAL4, which regulates the transcription of several yeast genes whose products metabolize galactose. Like the genes in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RvlevVMOHa">lac</i> operon, the genes that control galactose metabolism are inducible: when galactose is absent, these genes are not transcribed and the proteins that break down galactose are not produced; when galactose is present, the genes are transcribed and the enzymes are synthesized. GAL4 contains several zinc fingers (DNA-binding motifs) and binds to a DNA sequence called UAS<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_mHJj1VOiTh">G</sub> (upstream activating sequence for GAL4). UAS<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_ZN3Xt3RTze">G</sub> exhibits the properties of an enhancer—a regulatory sequence that lies some distance from the regulated gene. When bound to UAS<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_suMsm3I2uT">G</sub>, GAL4 activates the transcription of yeast genes needed for metabolizing galactose. GAL4 and a number of other transcription factors contain multiple amino acids with negative charges that form an <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1h1RBgNKiF">acidic activation domain</i>. These acidic activators stimulate transcription by enhancing the assembly of the basal transcription apparatus.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_4n0JeE2Yl2">A particular region of GAL4 binds another protein called GAL80, which regulates the activity of GAL4 in the presence of galactose. When galactose is absent, GAL80 binds to GAL4, preventing GAL4 from activating transcription (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Bkh2P82z9J" id="ben_9781319297145_EsO2hruQxx"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_MmozQilMWN">Figure 17.7</strong></a>). When galactose is present, however, the sugar binds to another protein called GAL3, which interacts with GAL80, causing a conformational change in GAL80 so that it can no longer bind GAL4. The GAL4 protein is then free to bind to UAS<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_PGbtKF4DOi">G</sub> and activate the transcription of the genes whose products metabolize galactose.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_VI8dgmCq1v">Enhancers are regulatory elements that affect the transcription of distant genes. For example, an enhancer that regulates the gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor is located 69,000 bp downstream of the gene’s promoter; some vertebrate enhancers act over distances of millions of base pairs. The exact position and orientation of an enhancer relative to the promoter it regulates are not critical to its function (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KBBmwjHUS4" id="ben_9781319297145_5WiMEszovL">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZCg4ObPLpL">In many eukaryotes, enhancers are highly abundant. For example, it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of enhancers in the human genome, compared to approximately 20,000 genes. Enhancers are often a few hundred base pairs in length and contain multiple binding sites for transcription factors; a typical enhancer contains about 10 binding sites for proteins that regulate transcription. Enhancers often regulate genes in a cell type–specific manner, meaning that they turn on different sets of genes in different cell types and help establish the traits that characterize cells of different tissues. Some enhancer-like elements are found in prokaryotes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_WF6p0tLYme">How can an enhancer affect the initiation of transcription at a promoter that is tens of thousands of base pairs away? In many cases, the binding of transcription factors to the enhancer causes the DNA between the enhancer and the promoter to loop out, bringing the promoter and enhancer close to each other, so that the transcription factors are able to interact directly with the basal transcription apparatus at the core promoter (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_4ysD0ca4Ut" id="ben_9781319297145_aU85ULllWM">Figure 17.5</a>). Some enhancers may be attracted to promoters by proteins that bind to sequences in the regulatory promoter and “tether” the enhancer close to the core promoter. Enhancers may also affect transcription by undergoing modifications that alter chromatin structure.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UQiIAT2EYE">Many enhancers are themselves transcribed into short RNA molecules called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Enhancer RNA is often produced bidirectionally, which means that RNA polymerase transcribes eRNA in both directions, copying a different DNA strand in each direction. These RNA molecules do not encode proteins, but transcription of eRNAs may play a role in enhancer function. Transcription of enhancers is often associated with transcription at the promoters that the enhancers affect. How transcription at an enhancer might affect transcription occurring at a distant promoter is not certain. The enhancer might recruit RNA polymerase, which might then be transferred to the promoter when the enhancer interacts with the promoter. Alternatively, transcription of the enhancer might allow the chromatin to adopt a more open configuration, which would then facilitate transcription at nearby promoters. The existence of eRNAs might also represent nothing more than transcriptional noise: because the enhancer is physically close to a promoter, where the concentration of RNA polymerase is high, the enhancer might get transcribed by accident.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7rAP8ZqsmL">Sometimes a number of enhancers are clustered together to form a

Super-enhancers are usually occupied by a high number of transcription factors and are able to stimulate higher levels of transcription than are regular enhancers. Examination of the chromatin surrounding super-enhancers suggests that the enhancers within the super-enhancer are in close physical proximity to one another and to the promoter of the gene they regulate. Super-enhancers appear to be important in determining cell identity.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Dq56fAlB9k">Much recent research indicates that specific chromosome structures play an important role in eukaryotic gene regulation and that insulators may be involved in the formation of these structures. Insulators bind proteins that allow chromatin to form topologically associated domains (TADs), which were discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_bs5ZndZ2Sd">Chapter 11</a>. Recall that TADs are large, spatially interacting regions of chromatin that are separated physically from other TADs. One model of how insulators work is that they bind proteins that cause chromatin <span aria-label="511" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page511" role="doc-pagebreak" title="511"/>loops, allowing enhancers to interact with promoters within the same TAD but preventing enhancers from interacting with promoters in different TADs. For example, a common insulator-binding protein in vertebrates is CTCF, which is found bound to DNA at the base of TADs and, with the help of cohesin, is thought to be involved in the formation of chromatin loops (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_N4zd944zl2" id="ben_9781319297145_RLypb5rDQ7"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_L4j5HPDkfS">Figure 17.9</strong></a>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ctAdIp0sgL">As we’ve seen, transcription in eukaryotes is often regulated through factors that affect the initiation of transcription, including changes in chromatin structure and transcription factors. Transcription may also be controlled through factors that affect stalling and elongation by RNA polymerase after transcription has been initiated.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_J0uHhN4uXf">The basal transcription apparatus—consisting of RNA polymerase, general transcription factors, and other proteins—assembles at the core promoter. When the initiation of transcription has taken place, RNA polymerase moves downstream, transcribing the structural gene and producing an RNA product. At some genes, RNA polymerase initiates transcription and transcribes 24 to 50 nucleotides of RNA but then pauses or stalls. For example, stalling is observed at genes that encode

Heat-shock proteins are produced by a large number of different genes. During times of environmental stress, transcription of all the heat-shock genes is greatly elevated. In the absence of stress, RNA polymerase initiates transcription at heat-shock genes in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_94FCh74mH4">Drosophila</i> but stalls downstream of the transcription start site. Stalled polymerases are released when stress is encountered, allowing rapid transcription of the genes and the production of heat-shock proteins that facilitate adaptation to the stressful environment.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_biGPiZlT5L">Stalling was formerly thought to take place at only a small number of genes, but research now indicates that stalling is widespread throughout eukaryotic genomes, occurring at 30% to 50% of genes. Several factors that promote stalling have been identified. One of these factors is a protein called negative elongation factor (NELF), which binds to RNA polymerase and causes it to stall after initiation. Another protein, called positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), relieves stalling and promotes elongation by phosphorylating NELF and RNA polymerase, perhaps by causing NELF to dissociate from the polymerase.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_T0zQiAkP2F">Although most eukaryotic cells do not possess operons, several eukaryotic genes may be activated by the same stimulus. Groups of bacterial genes are often coordinately expressed (turned on and off together) because they are physically clustered in an operon and share a promoter, but coordinately expressed genes in eukaryotic cells are not clustered.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JbP1aMa5Co">Genes that are coordinately expressed in eukaryotic cells are able to respond to the same stimulus because they share short regulatory sequences in their promoters or enhancers. For example, different eukaryotic heat-shock genes (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#page511" id="ben_9781319297145_h3OnzphNcp">p. 511</a>) possess a common regulatory sequence upstream of their transcription start sites.

The response elements are binding sites for transcription factors, which bind to the response elements and elevate transcription. If the same response element is present at multiple genes, it allows all those genes to be activated by the same stimulus. For example, transcription factors that bind to heat-shock elements activate genes that help cells respond to heat and other types of stress.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_jUDWypLLRt">A single eukaryotic gene may be regulated by several different response elements. For example, the metallothionein gene encodes a protein that protects cells from the toxicity of heavy metals by binding to those metals and removing them from cells. Under normal conditions, the basal transcription apparatus assembles around the TATA box just upstream of the transcription start site for the metallothionein gene, but the apparatus alone is capable of only low rates of transcription. Other response elements found upstream of the metallothionein gene contribute to increasing its rate of transcription. For example, several copies of a metal response element (MRE) lie upstream of the metallothionein gene (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8qiiFdQRjb" id="ben_9781319297145_T6ccHpx7BP"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_D1otP4jWHx">Figure 17.10</strong></a>). The presence of heavy metals stimulates the binding of transcription factors to the MRE, which elevates the rate of transcription of the metallothionein gene. Because there are multiple copies of the MRE, high rates of transcription are induced by metals. Two enhancers are also located in the region upstream of the metallothionein gene. One of these enhancers contains a response element known as TRE, which stimulates transcription in the presence of a protein called AP1. A third response element, called GRE, is located approximately 250 nucleotides upstream of the metallothionein gene and stimulates transcription in response to certain hormones.</p>
