<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_UW2MmgRrW9">Leprosy, one of the most feared diseases in history, was well known in ancient times, and people with leprosy were frequently ostracized from society. Although leprosy is successfully treated today with antibiotics, it remains a major public health problem: from 2 million to 3 million people worldwide are disabled by leprosy, and over 200,000 new cases are reported each year. In its severest form, leprosy causes paralysis, blindness, and disfigurement. Leprosy is caused by the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fwVfx1GvvX">Mycobacterium leprae</i>, which infects cells of the nervous system—although human genes do play a role in susceptibility to this disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_srggKVXeIs">In 2013, geneticists isolated DNA of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZSXPImtjTF">M. leprae</i> from five skeletons of medieval Europeans who exhibited signs of leprosy. Their comparisons of the gene sequences of these ancient bacteria with those of modern strains provided insight into the evolution of this organism. Scientists had previously determined the genome sequence of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_B8c94rxStz">M. leprae</i> and found that it contains 3,268,203 base pairs of DNA, 1 million base pairs fewer than the genomes of other mycobacteria. In most bacterial genomes, the vast majority of the DNA encodes proteins—little DNA lies between the protein-encoding genes. In contrast, only 50% of the DNA of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_y4n3m3glC1">M. leprae</i> encodes proteins. <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Tdj3KW9G6K">M. leprae</i> also has 2300 fewer genes than its close relative <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7WcqWUOHMT">M. tuberculosis</i>. An incredible 27% of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XElIuu4t2f">M. leprae</i>’s genome consists of nonfunctional copies of genes (called pseudogenes) that have been inactivated by mutations. Its reduced DNA content, fewer functional genes, and large number of pseudogenes suggest that evolutionarily, the genome of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GHhrmYoJYI">M. leprae</i> has undergone massive decay over time, losing DNA and acquiring mutations that have inactivated many of its genes. Although the reasons for this decay are not known, it helps account for <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Srmi1csxH2">M. leprae</i>’s long generation time—14 days in humans, an incredibly long replication time for a bacterium—and the inability of scientists to culture the bacteria in the laboratory.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_P99iDOsa9P">Leprosy was common in Europe until the Middle Ages, when it disappeared from the population. Why did it disappear from Europe, despite remaining common in many other parts of the world? To address this question, geneticists extracted DNA from the bones and teeth of five medieval skeletons (dating from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries) exhumed from cemeteries in Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. They separated out the DNA of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_rfdrE0ekEx">M. leprae</i> and determined whole-genome sequences for the bacteria. They then compared the DNA sequences of these medieval strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_5FiDB6RChR">M. leprae</i> with those of modern strains from India, Thailand, the United States, Brazil, and other locations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_C7lz068zo7">This analysis revealed that the ancient strains of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_6O9JRcNveB">M. leprae</i> were remarkably similar to modern strains. Three of the ancient strains were most closely related to modern strains from Iran and Turkey, suggesting a Middle Eastern–European connection to the disease. Some of the ancient strains were closely related to modern <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xHsJxJr5h7">M. leprae</i> currently <span aria-label="258" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page258" role="doc-pagebreak" title="258"/>found in the United States, suggesting that these North American bacteria originated in Europe. The close similarity between ancient European strains and a modern virulent strain from North America suggests that leprosy did not disappear from Europe because it lost its virulence. More likely, improved social conditions, changes in the immunity of Europeans, or the presence of other infectious diseases brought about the demise of leprosy in Europe. This study of leprosy illustrates the importance of genetic studies of bacteria to human health and shows how modern tools of evolutionary and molecular genetics are being applied to our understanding of bacterial biology.</p>
