<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aM39p2ku2J">The spleen is an underappreciated organ. Brownish in color and weighing about a third of a pound, it sits in the left upper-part of your abdomen, storing blood and filtering out bacteria and old blood cells. The spleen is underappreciated because it’s widely believed that you can live without a spleen. Indeed, many people who lose their spleen to automobile accidents and other trauma do survive, although they are at increased risk of infection. But a young child without a spleen is in serious trouble. A small group of children are born without spleens; these kids are highly susceptible to life-threatening bacterial infections, and many die in childhood. This rare disorder, known as isolated congenital asplenia (ICA), is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Q5IuqhPI18">Except for the absence of a spleen, children with ICA are unaffected. But their immune function is severely compromised. When infected with bacteria that the immune system normally eliminates, these children develop raging infections that quickly spread throughout the body. Even when treated with modern antibiotics, they often die.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DoOaulY1K5">In 2013, an international team led by scientists from Rockefeller University discovered the genetic cause of ICA. Using the power of DNA sequencing, they examined all the coding DNA of 23 individuals with ICA and compared their DNA sequences with those of 508 individuals with normal spleens. Statistical analysis pointed to differences in one particular gene that was associated with ICA, a gene-encoding ribosomal protein SA (RPSA). The RPSA protein is one of the 33 proteins that make up the small subunit of the ribosome, the molecular complex responsible for protein synthesis. How a defect in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2rrOsDFmyE">RPSA</i> gene results in the absence of a spleen is not known. Diseases such as ICA, which result from defective ribosomes, are referred to as ribosomopathies.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tmn5YT8fag">Many, but not all, individuals with ICA have mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1jFKfmytfD">RPSA</i>, indicating that other genes may also be involved in the disorder. The researchers found several different types of mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_DTkwgYetBm">RPSA</i> associated with ICA: some caused premature stop codons, halting translation before a functional protein could be made; one was a frameshift mutation, a change that alters the way the mRNA sequence is read during translation; and others changed the amino acid sequence of the RPSA protein.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_c3KXeRAjLb">One interesting but unanswered question is why a defect in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Niq3Ejmg9G">RPSA</i> affects only the spleen. Inherited mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_FLHuAaBqoA">RPSA</i> occur in every cell of the body, and protein synthesis—carried out by ribosomes—is essential for numerous life processes, yet these mutations affect only the development of the spleen. Why aren’t other organs altered? Why aren’t numerous physiological functions affected? Scientists are still studying these important questions.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xSKhv4LDmQ">Isolated congenital asplenia illustrates the extreme importance of translation, the process of protein synthesis, which is the focus of this chapter. We begin by examining the molecular relation between genotype and phenotype. Next, we study the genetic code—the instructions that specify the amino acid sequence of a protein—and then examine the mechanism of translation. Our primary focus is protein synthesis in bacterial cells, but we also examine some features of this process in eukaryotic cells. At the end of the chapter, we look at some additional aspects of protein synthesis.</p>
