<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yN6ynE3flD">As we have learned, cancer is a disease caused by alterations in DNA. However, there are many different types of genetic alterations that may contribute to the development of cancer. More than 350 different human genes have been identified that contribute to cancer; the actual number is probably much higher. Research on mice suggests that more than 2000 genes can, when mutated, contribute to the development of cancer. In this section, we consider some of the different types of genes that frequently have roles in cancer.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_HryFEKHBs0">The signals that regulate cell division fall into two basic types: molecules that stimulate cell division and molecules that inhibit it. These control mechanisms are similar to the accelerator and brake of a car. In normal cells (but, one would hope, not in your car), both accelerators and brakes are applied at the same time, causing cell division to proceed at the proper speed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_HjemwOK9MJ">Because cell division is affected by both accelerators and brakes, cancer can arise from mutations in either type of signal, so there are several fundamentally different routes to cancer. A stimulatory gene can be made hyperactive or active at inappropriate times, which is analogous to having a car’s accelerator stuck in the floored position. Mutations in stimulatory genes usually act in a dominant manner because even the amount of gene product produced by a single allele is usually sufficient to have a stimulatory effect. Mutated dominant-acting stimulatory genes that cause cancer are termed

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_LlmMXeJbSv">Oncogenes were the first cancer-causing genes to be identified. In 1909, a farmer brought physician Peyton Rous a hen with a large connective-tissue tumor (sarcoma) growing on its breast. When Rous injected pieces of this tumor into other hens, they also developed sarcomas. Rous conducted experiments that demonstrated that the tumors were being transmitted by a retrovirus, which became known as the Rous sarcoma virus. A number of other cancer-causing viruses were subsequently isolated from various animal tissues. These viruses were generally assumed to carry a cancer-causing gene that was transferred to the host cell. The first oncogene, called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nsDF9rNsJY">src</i>, was isolated from the Rous sarcoma virus in 1970.</p>

They discovered that the genomes of all normal cells carry DNA sequences that are closely related to oncogenes. These normal cellular genes are called

They are responsible for basic cellular functions in normal cells, but when mutated, they become oncogenes that contribute to the development of cancer. When a virus infects a cell, a proto-oncogene may become incorporated into the viral genome through recombination. Within the viral genome, the proto-oncogene may mutate to an oncogene that, when inserted back into a host cell, causes rapid cell division and cancer. While viruses are capable of converting proto-oncogenes into oncogenes, most proto-oncogenes are mutated to form oncogenes without the involvement of a virus.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_097lGSNAHq">Many oncogenes have been identified by experiments in which selected fragments of DNA are added to cells in culture. Some of the cells take up the DNA, and if these cells become cancerous, then the DNA fragment that was added to the culture must contain an oncogene. The fragments can then be sequenced and the oncogene identified.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_r3S0KjHhyz">The cell cycle is the normal process by which cells undergo growth and division. Normally, progression through the cell cycle is tightly regulated so that cells divide only when additional cells are needed, when all the components necessary for division are present, and when the DNA has been replicated without damage. Sometimes, however, errors arise in one or more of the components that regulate the cell cycle. These errors often cause cells to divide at inappropriate times or rates, leading to cancer. Indeed, many proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes function normally by helping to control the cell cycle. Before considering how errors in this system contribute to cancer, we must first understand how the cell cycle is usually regulated.</p>

Below this is the G 1-S checkpoint, where C-D-K gets phosphorylated. The S phase passes into the G 2 phase shown on the bottom left. Increasing cyclin B, an inactive M-P-F, and activating factors are shown. At the 10 o’clock point is the G 2-M checkpoint and the beginning of mitosis. An active C D K and the spindle-assembly checkpoint are present. At the end of mitosis, the breakdown of nuclear envelope, chromosome condensation, spindle assembly, and cyclin B degradation occurs. Below the cell cycle, a table with five columns and two rows is shown. The column headers are as follows: Interphase further subdivided into G 2; mitosis; interphase further subdivided into G 1, S, and G 2; mitosis; and interphase further subdivided into G 1. The table shows two curves for level of cyclin B and level of active M P F (mitosis-promoting factor). Level of cyclin B rises in first column, continues to rise in column 2 and declines steeply in the same column. A caption reads, “Cyclin B accumulates throughout interphase. Near the end of G 2, active M P F reaches a critical level, which causes the cell to progress through the G 2 over M checkpoint and into mitosis.” Another caption reads, “Degradation of cyclin B near the end of mitosis causes the active M P F level to drop, and the cell reenters interphase.” Then, rises till column 4 and declines again in the same column and rises in the last column. A caption reads, “Increasing levels of cyclin B during interphase combine with C D K to produce increasing levels of inactive M P F.” Level of active M P F (mitosis-promoting factor) starts at a low level in column 2, forms a high concave down curve in column 2, declines in column 3, forms another high concave down curve in column 4, and declines again in column 5. Two captions read as follows: “Near the end of interphase, activating factors remove phosphate groups from M P F, producing active M P F, which brings about the breakdown of the nuclear envelope, chromosome condensation, spindle assembly, and other events associated with mitosis. Near the end of metaphase, cyclin B degradation lowers the amount of active M P F, which brings about anaphase, telophase, cytokinesis, and eventually interphase.”</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Si7U3CCXaI">Some proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes have roles in apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death in which the cell’s DNA is degraded, its nucleus and cytoplasm shrink, and the cell undergoes phagocytosis by other cells without the leakage of its contents. Each cell has the ability to assess its own state, and if it detects abnormalities or damage, they normally undergo apoptosis (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_abx4ws9OuH" id="ben_9781319297145_7hPlqCrPuq">Section 22.4</a>). Cancer cells frequently have chromosome mutations, DNA damage, or other cellular anomalies that would normally stimulate apoptosis and prevent their proliferation. Many of these cells have mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis and therefore do not undergo programmed cell death. The ability of a cell to initiate apoptosis in response to DNA damage, for example, depends on <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0B6ysl5NiS">p53</i>, which is inactive in many human cancers.</p>

Autophagy maintains the quality of the proteins and organelles within the cell and helps during times of stress by recycling essential components and conserving energy. Autophagy has been shown to suppress tumor formation under some conditions and promote tumor growth under others. For example, mice that are deficient in autophagy show elevated rates of cancer because autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis and maintains organelle quality, both of which help prevent cancer development. On the other hand, autophagy can promote cancer by allowing cancer cells to survive the stressful conditions of tumor development and cancer treatment.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_bQmbuDAeaU">Whether cells pass through the cell cycle and continue to divide is influenced by a large number of internal and external signals. External signals are initiated by hormones and growth factors. These molecules are often unable to pass through the cell membrane because of their size or charge; they exert their effects by binding to receptors on the cell surface. This binding triggers a series of intracellular reactions that then carry the message to the nucleus or another site within the cell. This type of system, in which an external signal triggers a cascade of intracellular reactions that ultimately produce a specific response, is called a

Defects in signal-transduction pathways are often associated with cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ulWMhbmBk7">A signal-transduction pathway begins with the binding of an external signaling molecule to a specific receptor that is embedded in the cell membrane. Receptors in signal-transduction pathways usually have three parts: (1) an extracellular domain that protrudes from the cell and binds the signaling molecule; (2) a transmembrane domain that passes across the membrane and conducts the signal to the interior of the cell; and (3) an intracellular domain that extends into the cytoplasm and, upon the binding of the signaling molecule, undergoes a chemical or conformational change that is transmitted to molecules of the signal-transduction pathway in the cytoplasm. The binding of a signaling molecule to the membrane-bound receptor activates a protein in the pathway. On activation, this protein activates the next molecule in the pathway, often by adding or removing phosphate groups or causing changes in the conformation of the protein. The newly activated protein activates the next molecule in the pathway, and in this way, the signal is passed along through a cascade of reactions and ultimately produces the response, such as stimulating or inhibiting the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_upELkChSdI">Researchers have determined the pathways by which various signals influence the cell cycle. To illustrate signal transduction, let’s consider the Ras signal-transduction pathway, which plays an important role in control of the cell cycle. Each Ras protein cycles between an active form and an inactive form. In its inactive form, a Ras protein is bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP); in its active form, it is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_olzmWaLp2v">The Ras signal-transduction pathway is activated when a growth factor, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), binds to a receptor on the cell membrane (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_t4BI0LmDyZ"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Rrs5dJm9qG" id="ben_9781319297145_za6LuDvtMG">Figure 23.9</a></strong>). The binding of EGF causes a conformational change in the receptor and the addition of phosphate groups to it. The addition of the phosphate groups allows adaptor molecules to bind to the receptor. These adaptor molecules link the receptor with an inactive molecule of Ras protein. The adaptor molecules activate Ras by stimulating it to release GDP and bind GTP. The newly activated Ras protein then binds to an inactive form of another protein, called Raf, and activates it. After activating Raf, the Ras protein hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning to its inactive form.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_f3ewUIt3Rp">As we have seen, cancer arises from the accumulation of multiple mutations in a single cell. Some cancer cells have normal rates of mutation, and multiple mutations accumulate because each mutation gives the cell a replicative advantage over cells without the mutations. Other cancer cells have higher-than-normal rates of mutation in all of their genes, which leads to more frequent mutation of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. What might be the source of these high rates of mutation in some cancer cells?</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_S2MNSQqlul">Two processes control the rate at which mutations arise within a cell: (1) the rate at which errors arise during and after the course of DNA replication and (2) the efficiency with which these errors are corrected. The error rate in replication is controlled by the fidelity of DNA polymerases and other proteins involved in the replication process (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_l3DG8meyw8" id="ben_9781319297145_Muf6yPSKBf">Chapter 12</a>). However, defects in genes encoding replication proteins have not been strongly linked to cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zgUp4xzzGo">The mutation rate is also strongly affected by whether errors are corrected by DNA-repair systems (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_COpHgno1B0" id="ben_9781319297145_hXftY7rue9">Section 18.5</a>). Defects in genes that encode components of these repair systems have been consistently associated with a number of cancers. People with xeroderma pigmentosum, for example, are defective in nucleotide-excision repair, an important DNA-repair system that normally corrects DNA damage caused by a number of mutagens, including ultraviolet light. Likewise, about 13% of colorectal, endometrial, and stomach cancers have cells that are defective in mismatch repair, another major DNA-repair system in the cell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JmAqUkoIxF">A particular type of colon cancer, called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In families with this condition, a person can inherit one mutated and one normal allele of a gene that <span aria-label="718" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page718" role="doc-pagebreak" title="718"/>controls mismatch repair. The normal allele provides sufficient levels of the protein product for mismatch repair to function, but it is highly likely that this normal allele will become mutated or lost in at least a few cells. If it does so, there is no mismatch repair, and these cells undergo higher-than-normal rates of mutation, leading to defects in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes that cause the cells to proliferate.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pi2bqbIXiV">Defects in DNA-repair systems may also contribute to the generation of chromosome rearrangements and genomic instability. Many DNA-repair systems make single- and double-strand breaks in the DNA as part of the repair process. If these breaks are not repaired properly, then chromosome rearrangements often result.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Z4LSSSHtn6">Another factor that may contribute to the progression of cancer is the inappropriate activation of the enzyme telomerase. Telomeres are special sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Recall from <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_l3DG8meyw8" id="ben_9781319297145_5CA5i1MAFe">Chapter 12</a> that in most somatic cells, the ends of chromosomes cannot be replicated, and the telomeres become shorter with each cell division. This shortening eventually leads to the destruction of the chromosomes and cell death, so somatic cells are capable of only a limited number of cell divisions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vetyMZpeHE">In germ cells and stem cells, telomerase replicates the chromosome ends (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KMAZgpCx1o" id="ben_9781319297145_tKiUCtMNJN">pp. 364–366 in Chapter 12</a>), thereby maintaining the telomeres, but this enzyme is not normally expressed in somatic cells. In many tumor cells, however, sequences that regulate the expression of the telomerase gene are mutated, allowing the enzyme to be expressed, and the cell is capable of unlimited cell division. This mutation allows cancer cells to divide indefinitely.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EmgxOGq6S7">Neuroblastoma, for example, is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that occurs in children. Many of these tumors are low-risk, regressing spontaneously or responding to treatment. On the other hand, about half are high-risk, do not respond to treatment, and are often lethal. In an attempt to differentiate between low-risk and high-risk neuroblastoma tumors, researchers sequenced the entire genome of a series of these tumors. They found that many of the high-risk tumors had chromosome rearrangements or other mutations that increased the expression of telomerase. Thus, expression of telomerase appears to be a characteristic of many high-risk neuroblastomas.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8TVaRyKU2R">Another important group of factors that contribute to the progression of cancer includes genes that affect the growth and spread of tumors. Oxygen and nutrients, which are essential to the survival and growth of tumors, are supplied by blood vessels, and the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important to tumor progression. Angiogenesis is stimulated by growth factors and other proteins encoded by genes whose expression is carefully regulated in normal cells. In tumor cells, genes encoding these proteins are often overexpressed compared with normal cells, and inhibitors of angiogenesis-promoting factors may be inactivated or underexpressed. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key protein involved in angiogenesis, and it is often overexpressed in cancer cells. This leads to new blood vessels, allowing the tumor to grow rapidly. At least one inherited cancer—von Hippel–Lindau disease, in which people develop multiple types of tumors—is caused by the mutation of a gene that affects angiogenesis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RyGQkaBwUt">In the development of many cancers, the primary tumor gives rise to cells that spread to distant sites, producing secondary tumors. This is called metastasis and is the cause of death in 90% of human cancer deaths. Metastasis is a complex process, requiring that cancer cells escape from the primary tumor site, evade the immune system, travel to a distant site, adhere to existing cells at the new site, and receive nutrients and growth factors necessary for sustained growth. The process requires numerous cellular changes induced by somatic mutation at a number of genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mKD3RnDHoj">By using microarrays to measure levels of gene expression in tumors, researchers have identified genes that are transcribed at a significantly higher rate in metastatic cells than in nonmetastatic cells. For example, one study detected a set of 95 genes that were overexpressed or underexpressed in a population of metastatic breast cancer cells that were strongly metastatic to the lung, compared with a population of cells that were only weakly metastatic to the lung. Genes that contribute to metastasis often encode components of the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Others encode adhesion proteins, which help hold cells together.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_mg4AUKIK1e">Much recent research has focused on how abnormal cancer cells escape the immune system (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch22_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_aq2batjj9S" id="ben_9781319297145_KzML7QsaHz">Chapter 22</a>). In 2018, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their research on how the immune system can be stimulated to recognize and attack cancer cells. Research on the role of immunity in cancer continues, and immunotherapy is being used in the treatment of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_GAapTYPrS3">Advances in sequencing technology have now made it possible to study how metastasized tumor cells differ from normal cells, as well as from those of the primary tumor from which they were derived. In one experiment, researchers sequenced the entire genome of cells from a metastasized breast cancer tumor and compared it with the genome of normal cells from the same person and with the genome of the primary tumor, which had been removed from the patient nine years earlier. The researchers found 32 different somatic mutations in the coding regions of genes from the metastasized tumor cells, 19 of which were not detected in the primary tumor. This finding suggests that the metastasized tumor underwent considerable genetic changes in its nine-year evolution from the primary tumor. In contrast, <span aria-label="719" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page719" role="doc-pagebreak" title="719"/>another study of a breast cancer metastasis found only two mutations that were not present in the primary tumor, but in this case, the metastasis had evolved in only one year.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vC6j4b4Fw9">A long-standing view has been that metastasized tumors originate from a single cell that breaks off from the primary tumor and travels to a new site. A recent study that carried out genome sequencing of metastatic prostate tumors has revealed that metastases are sometimes composed of cells from more than one subclone found within the primary tumor. This finding shows that the metastases were seeded by multiple cells from the primary tumor, a process termed polyclonal seeding. There was also evidence that some metastatic tumors received cells from the primary tumor as well as from metastatic tumors at other sites in the body, a process called cross-seeding.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_K3k7dcAr0L">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that pair with complementary sequences on mRNA and degrade the mRNA or inhibit its translation (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TUZBFLs6AG" id="ben_9781319297145_XyFQhYKl0C">Section 14.5</a>). Given the fact that miRNAs are important in controlling gene expression and development, it is not surprising that they are also associated with tumor development. Many tumor cells exhibit widespread reduction in the expression of many miRNAs. Researchers have genetically engineered mouse tumor cells that lacked the machinery to generate miRNAs and found that these cells showed enhanced tumor progression when implanted into mice. Interestingly, this effect was seen only in cells that had already initiated tumor development, suggesting that miRNAs play a role in later stages of tumor progression.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7txSwZrLwJ">Lowered levels of miRNAs may contribute to cancer by allowing oncogenes that are normally controlled by the miRNAs to be expressed at high levels. For example, let-7 miRNA normally controls the expression of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BqGv5XMkHz">ras</i> oncogene, probably by binding to complementary sequences in the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_6HB3oJIBPY">′</sup> untranslated region of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_MGcF4R52aO">ras</i> mRNA and inhibiting translation. In lung-cancer cells, levels of let-7 miRNA are often low, allowing the Ras protein to be highly expressed, which then leads to the development of lung cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kovRK6rJlU">A transcription factor called c-MYC is often expressed at high levels in cancer cells. Evidence suggests that c-MYC helps to drive cell proliferation and the development of cancer. Among other effects, c-MYC binds to the promoters of miRNA genes and decreases their transcription, decreasing the abundance of the miRNAs. Some of these miRNAs are known to suppress tumor development. Research has shown that if, through genetic manipulation, the miRNAs are expressed at high levels, the development of tumors decreases. All of these findings suggest that altered expression of miRNAs plays an important role in cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MZe06Zs43n">In other cases, overexpression of miRNAs has been associated with cancer. For example, several miRNAs have been implicated in the process of metastasis. A particular miRNA called miR-10b has been associated with the formation of metastatic breast tumors. In one experiment, investigators manipulated a line of breast cancer cells so that miR-10b was overexpressed. When the manipulated cells were injected into mice, many of the mice developed metastatic tumors, demonstrating that high levels of this miRNA appear to promote the spread of cancer cells. Further study revealed that in humans, levels of miR-10b are elevated in metastatic tumors, as compared with breast tumors in metastasis-free patients. Research shows that miR-10b regulates the expression of a number of other genes, including some that are known to suppress the spread of tumor cells. Other miRNAs are known to inhibit metastasis.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ZBynyusXVP">Formed in 2008, the International Cancer Genome Consortium coordinates efforts to determine the genome sequences of tumors. A goal of the consortium is to completely sequence 500 tumors from each of 50 different types of cancer, along with the genomes of normal tissues from the same patients. This effort is producing important results, revealing the numbers and types of mutations that are associated with particular cancers. The hope is that new cancer-causing genes will be identified, which will lead to a better understanding of the nature of cancer and suggest new targets for cancer treatment. Another research project, called The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), began in the United States in 2005. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive genomic analysis of over 100 different types of cancer cells, including sequencing of all exons across the genome as well as characterization of mRNA expression, DNA methylation, copy-number variations, and microRNAs of the tumor cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Sqi722PmLp">The genomes of a number of tumors have been sequenced, and many more are currently being sequenced. For example, the entire genome of a small-cell lung carcinoma (a type of lung cancer) was sequenced in 2010 and compared with the <span aria-label="720" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page720" role="doc-pagebreak" title="720"/>genome of normal cells from the same person. More than 22,000 base-pair mutations were identified in the tumor, of which 134 were within protein-encoding genes. The tumor also possessed 58 chromosome rearrangements and 334 copy-number variations (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2c5H8e27UU" id="ben_9781319297145_OHKM5RaBVJ">Chapter 20</a>). In another study that was part of TCGA, researchers examined mRNA expression, microRNAs, DNA methylation, and copy-number variations in 489 ovarian adenocarcinomas and sequenced the DNA of exons from 316 of the tumors. Almost all of the tumors contained mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3D2XpqlXuU">p53</i>, a tumor-suppressor gene involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control. Mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_onYEz1Qi1j">BRCA1</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7fzjqRqmRg">BRCA2</i>, two tumor-suppressor genes that are also mutated in breast cancer, occurred in 22% of the tumors. Mutations in seven other genes occurred statistically more often than in normal cells. The results suggested several new approaches for drug treatment of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UrCLlOYVic">Another series of studies sequenced a number of genes in samples of malignant gliomas, an incurable and deadly form of brain cancer. The researchers examined DNA sequences, copy-number variations, DNA methylation, and RNA expression in these tumors. The analyses revealed mutations in several genes that appear to be important in the development of glioma tumors. All of these genomic studies are providing new insight into the genetic basis of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_hssrA0jGME">The mutations found in cancer genomes can be divided into two types: drivers and passengers.

Drivers include mutations in oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, DNA-repair genes, and the other types of genes discussed in this chapter that contribute to the progression of cancer. 
<dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="ben_9781319297145_DvApCemHiZ"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="pie_9781319216801_BM_glossary.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_VjAcRXke9v" id="ben_9781319297145_7k9Mg2S09x" role="doc-glossref">Passengers</a></dfn> are mutations that arise randomly in the process of tumor development and do not contribute to cancer progression. Many passengers are located in introns (regions between genes) and in other DNA that is not transcribed and translated, but they can also arise within protein-encoding genes. A major challenge is to determine which of the numerous mutations found in tumors are drivers, and actually contribute to the development of cancer, and which are passengers, with no effect.</p>
