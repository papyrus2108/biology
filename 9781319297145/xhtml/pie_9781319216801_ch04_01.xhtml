<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_37yj6VBoAU">Dragons are the stuff of kids’ tales and nightmares—giant fire-breathing reptiles that destroy everything in their path. These mythical creatures have a long history, appearing in folk traditions of both Europe and Asia. Almost always reptilian, dragons were originally depicted as snakelike, but since the Middle Ages they have been increasingly drawn with legs, often imagined as large lizards. In European traditions, dragons are usually evil, but in Asian myths, dragons are a symbol of benevolent power and sometimes of fertility.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_0n9WNQ11J7">Real dragons are found in the deserts of central Australia. Known as central bearded dragons (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_pyhM5kQvPh">Pogona vitticeps</i>), these lizards grow up to two feet in length (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_UPyoq4qmNl" id="ben_9781319297145_2CsQLVBvHP"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_0FbRcEal6y">Figure 4.1</strong></a>). Like some of their mythical relatives, they possess numerous spines that run from head to tail. Their color varies widely, from brown to gray, red, yellow, orange, or even white. Bearded dragons derive their name from a pouch that projects from the underside of the chin, often appearing dark in color,like a man’s beard. When threatened, they open their mouths and hiss, imitating their mythological namesake (but, disappointingly, without the fire). But it is through their sex that bearded dragons have become best known to geneticists.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Vss4WAnxkl">As we learn in this chapter, organisms employ an amazing variety of mechanisms to determine sex—whether an organism is male or female. In some, such as humans, sex is determined by chromosomes: females possess two identical sex chromosomes (X chromosomes), and males possess a single X and a different chromosome, called Y. In others, such as birds, butterflies, and some reptiles, sex is still chromosomal, but it is the male that possesses two identical sex chromosomes (called Z chromosomes) and the female that has two different sex chromosomes (called Z and W). There are even some animals for which sex is not determined by sex chromosomes at all but is primarily a function of the environment: in turtles and alligators, sex is influenced by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated, with males produced at one temperature and females at another.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NDAVTruk78">For many years, scientists thought that sex determination could be genetic or environmental, but not both. In 2015, however, scientists reported the results of field and laboratory studies demonstrating unequivocally that sex in bearded dragons is determined by sex chromosomes <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_SyVU7FBwk9">and</i> the temperature at which their eggs are incubated.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_dNVktQZFSi">A female bearded dragon lays a clutch of 11 to 30 eggs in a nest in the sand. The female then leaves the nest, and the eggs develop unattended, warmed by the desert sun. Eventually, baby dragons emerge from the eggs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_AxUwrEZr2j">Bearded dragons have sex chromosomes: males are normally ZZ and females are ZW. Scientists discovered, however, that over 20% of wild-caught females examined in one year had ZZ sex chromosomes, which are expected only in males. The scientists found that when they incubated eggs with ZZ embryos at temperatures below 32°C, the offspring were all males (as expected), but as they increased the incubation temperature, more and more ZZ embryos developed as females. At 36°C, almost all the ZZ individuals were females. They concluded that ZZ females found in the wild probably hatched from warm nests. Matings between ZZ males and ZZ females produced viable and fertile offspring, all ZZ; for unknown reasons, ZZ females themselves lay twice as many eggs as normal ZW females. In contrast to ZZ lizards, which can be male or female depending on incubation temperature, ZW lizards are always female. One concern of the researchers was how these lizards might respond to future climate change. If the environment warms significantly, only females may be produced, leading to the extinction of the species.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_iIF3bpXNR0">High incubation temperatures reverse the sex of ZZ bearded dragons, causing them to develop as females instead of males. Imagine that temperature also caused sex reversal in ZW individuals, so that high temperatures caused ZW individuals to develop as males instead of females (this doesn’t actually happen in bearded dragons). What would be the result of a mating between a normal ZW female and a sex-reversed ZW male?</li>

After Mendel’s principles were rediscovered in 1900, biologists began to conduct genetic studies on a wide array of different organisms. As they applied Mendel’s principles more widely, they observed exceptions that made it necessary to devise extensions of those basic principles. In this chapter, we explore one of those extensions: the inheritance of characteristics encoded by genes located on the sex chromosomes, which often differ between males and females (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_M5GWobmfZu"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_EU4PNCe4Hi" id="ben_9781319297145_l6sXTcS3Gf">Figure 4.2</a></strong>). These characteristics, and the genes that produce them, are referred to as sex linked. To understand the inheritance of sex-linked characteristics, we must first know how sex is determined—why some members of a species are male and others are female. Thus, the first part of this chapter focuses on sex determination. The second part examines how characteristics encoded by genes on the sex chromosomes are inherited and some of the consequences of this inheritance. In <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1Cr0Us1Qbh" id="ben_9781319297145_KDr32O74WG">Chapter 5</a>, we will explore some additional ways in which sex and inheritance interact.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Hwm5xjF1ZA">As we consider sex determination and sex-linked characteristics, it will be helpful to keep two important principles in mind. First, there are several different mechanisms of sex determination, and ultimately, a species’ mechanism of sex <span aria-label="83" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" role="doc-pagebreak" title="83"/>determination controls its inheritance of sex-linked characteristics. Second, like other pairs of chromosomes, the X and Y sex chromosomes pair in the course of meiosis and segregate, but throughout most of their length, they are not homologous (their gene sequences do not encode the same characteristics): most genes on the X chromosome are different from genes on the Y chromosome. Consequently, males and females do not possess the same numbers of alleles at sex-linked loci. This difference in the number of sex-linked alleles produces distinct patterns of inheritance in males and females.</p>
