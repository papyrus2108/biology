<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_LFpsPpaIHV">Sexual reproduction is the formation of offspring that are genetically distinct from their parents; most often, two parents contribute genes to their offspring, and those genes are assorted into new combinations through meiosis. Among most eukaryotes, sexual reproduction consists of two processes that lead to an alternation of haploid and diploid cells: meiosis produces haploid gametes (spores in plants), and fertilization produces diploid zygotes (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_pSHkSoyW2H" id="ben_9781319297145_2rGvGQV5I1"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_jIOprKzB6y">Figure 4.3</strong></a>).</p>

We define the sex of an individual organism in reference to its phenotype. Sometimes an individual organism has chromosomes or genes that are normally associated with one sex but an anatomy corresponding to the opposite sex. For instance, the cells of human females normally have two X chromosomes, and the cells of males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A few rare individuals have male anatomy although their cells each contain two X chromosomes. Even though these people are genetically female, we refer to them as male because their sexual phenotype is male. (As we see later in the chapter, these XX males usually have a small piece of the Y chromosome that is attached to another chromosome.)</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zk1NuJxrs8">The chromosome theory of heredity (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lgF7rF7G1D" id="ben_9781319297145_NQVMCo96VV">Chapter 3</a>) states that genes are located on chromosomes, which serve as <span aria-label="84" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" role="doc-pagebreak" title="84"/>vehicles for the segregation of genes in meiosis. Definitive proof of this theory was provided by the discovery that the sex of certain insects is determined by the presence or absence of particular chromosomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_nBYBhq02Np">In 1891, Hermann Henking noticed a peculiar structure in the nuclei of cells from male insects. Understanding neither its function nor its relation to sex, he called this structure the X body. Later, Clarence E. McClung studied the X body in grasshoppers and recognized that it was a chromosome. McClung called it the accessory chromosome, but it eventually became known as the X chromosome, from Henking’s original designation. McClung observed that the cells of female grasshoppers had one more chromosome than the cells of male grasshoppers, and he concluded that accessory chromosomes played a role in sex determination. In 1905, Nettie Stevens and Edmund Wilson demonstrated that in grasshoppers and other insects, the cells of females have two X chromosomes, whereas <span aria-label="85" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page85" role="doc-pagebreak" title="85"/>the cells of males have a single X. In some insects, they counted the same number of chromosomes in the cells of males and females but saw that one chromosome pair was different: two X chromosomes were found in female cells, whereas a single X chromosome plus a smaller chromosome, which they called Y, was found in male cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ibfzJzIJ5A">Stevens and Wilson also showed that the X and Y chromosomes separate into different cells in sperm formation: half of the sperm receive an X chromosome and the other half receive a Y. All eggs produced by the female in meiosis receive one X chromosome. A sperm containing a Y chromosome unites with an X-bearing egg to produce an XY male, whereas a sperm containing an X chromosome unites with an X-bearing egg to produce an XX female. This distribution of X and Y chromosomes in sperm accounts for the 1:1 sex ratio observed in most dioecious organisms (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_i4eCqbaWDC" id="ben_9781319297145_fY8koUkYMN"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_dRATAyW06D">Figure 4.5</strong></a>). Because sex is inherited like other genetically determined characteristics, Stevens and Wilson’s discovery that sex is associated with the inheritance of a particular chromosome also demonstrated that genes are located on chromosomes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Eo6IaErnpY">In the ZZ-ZW sex-determining system, found in the bearded dragons discussed in the chapter introduction, the female is heterogametic and the male is homogametic. To prevent confusion with the XX-XY system, the sex chromosomes in this system are called Z and W, but the chromosomes do not resemble Zs and Ws. Females in this system are ZW; after meiosis, half of the eggs have a Z chromosome and the other half have a W chromosome. Males are ZZ; all sperm contain a single Z chromosome. The ZZ-ZW system is found in birds, some reptiles, butterflies, some amphibians, and some fishes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_1hdqQdXFFu">The discovery that the presence or absence of particular chromosomes determines sex in insects provided evidence that genes are located on chromosomes. In XX-XO sex determination, the male is XO and heterogametic, and the female is XX and homogametic. In XX-XY sex determination, the male is XY and the female is XX; in this system, the male is heterogametic. In ZZ-ZW sex determination, the female is ZW and the male is ZZ; in this system, the female is the heterogametic sex.</p>

Slipper limpets live in stacks, one on top of another. Each limpet begins life as a swimming larva. The first larva to settle on a solid, unoccupied substrate develops into a female limpet. It then produces chemicals that attract other larvae, which settle on top of it. These larvae develop into males, which then serve as mates for the limpet below. After a period of time, the males on top develop into females and, in turn, attract additional larvae, which settle on top of the stack, develop into males, and serve as mates for the limpets under <span aria-label="86" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" role="doc-pagebreak" title="86"/>them.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OBfGQ1aYar">Environmental factors are also important in determining sex in some reptiles; the sexual phenotype of many turtles, crocodiles, alligators, and a few birds is affected by temperature during embryonic development. In some turtles, for example, warm incubation temperatures produce more females, whereas cool temperatures produce males. In alligators, the reverse is true. In a few species, sex chromosomes determine whether individuals are male or female, but environmental factors can override this chromosomal sex determination. As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, bearded dragons are normally male when ZZ and female when ZW, but when the eggs are incubated at high temperatures, ZZ individuals develop into phenotypic females.

Usually, females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome. In the 1920s, Calvin Bridges proposed that sex in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BhfB5ZNuwH">Drosophila</i> was determined not by the number of X and Y chromosomes but rather by the balance of female-determining genes on the X chromosome and male-determining genes on the autosomes. He suggested that a fly’s sex is determined by the so-called X : A ratio that is the number of X chromosomes divided by the number of haploid sets of autosomes. Normal flies possess two haploid sets of autosomes and either two X chromosomes (females) or one X chromosome and a Y chromosome (males). Bridges proposed that an X : A ratio of 1.0 produces a female fly and that an X : A ratio of 0.5 produces a male fly. He also suggested that an X : A ratio between 1.0 and 0.5 produces an intersex fly, with a mixture of male and female characteristics. An X : A ratio of less than 0.5 or greater than 1.0 produces developmentally abnormal flies called metamales and metafemales, respectively. When Bridges and others examined flies with different numbers of sex chromosomes and autosomes, the X : A ratio appeared to correctly predict the phenotypic sex of the flies (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_9v6GdngYd2"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_P7bSvS7Vbc" id="ben_9781319297145_ng4P5AEheX">Table 4.2</a></strong>).</p>

Researchers have located a number of genes on the X chromosome that affect sexual phenotype, but few autosomal sex-determining genes (required for the X : A ratio hypothesis) have been identified. New evidence indicates that genes on the X chromosome are the primary sex determinant. The influence of the number of sets of autosomes on sex is indirect, affecting the timing of developmental events and therefore how long sex-determining genes on the X chromosome are active. For example, XX flies with three autosomal sets (XX, AAA) have an X : A ratio of 0.67 and develop an intersex phenotype. In these flies, the presence of three autosomal sets causes a critical developmental stage to shorten, not allowing female factors encoded on the X chromosomes enough time to accumulate, with the result that the flies end up with an intersex phenotype. Thus, the number of autosomal sets of chromosomes influences sex determination in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_HQ4PeRAgfP">Drosophila</i>, but not through the action of autosomal genes, as envisioned by Bridges.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Z1UaRHZOlq">The Y chromosome in humans, and in all other mammals, is of paramount importance in producing a male phenotype. However, scientists have discovered a few rare XX males whose cells apparently lack a Y chromosome. For many years, these males presented an enigma: How could a male phenotype exist without a Y chromosome? Close examination eventually revealed a small part of the Y chromosome attached to another chromosome, usually the X. This finding indicates that it is not the entire Y chromosome that determines maleness in humans; rather, it is a gene on the Y chromosome.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5Cgv7B31Cw">Early in development, all humans possess undifferentiated gonads and both male and female reproductive ducts. Then, about six weeks after fertilization, a gene on the Y chromosome becomes active. This gene causes the neutral gonads to develop into testes, which begin to secrete two hormones: testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone. Testosterone and other androgens induce the development of male characteristics, and anti-Müllerian hormone causes the degeneration of the female reproductive ducts. In the absence of this male-determining gene, the neutral gonads become ovaries, and female features develop. In mice, the regression of male reproductive ducts in females is promoted by another protein called chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII).</p>

Inside the abdominal cavity, a pair of testes produce levels of testosterone normally seen in males. The cells of a woman with androgen-insensitivity syndrome contain an X and a Y chromosome.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TbEWZCooaw">How can a person be female in appearance when her cells contain a Y chromosome and she has testes that produce testosterone? The answer lies in the complex relation between genes and sex in humans. In a human embryo with a Y chromosome, the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_YdZgQH4Axt">SRY</i> gene causes the gonads to develop into testes, which produce testosterone. Normally, testosterone stimulates embryonic tissues to develop male characteristics. But for testosterone to have its effect, it must bind to an androgen receptor. This receptor is defective in females with androgen-insensitivity syndrome; consequently, their cells do not respond to testosterone, and female characteristics develop. The gene for the androgen receptor is located on the X chromosome, so people with this condition always inherit it from their mothers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BwwYvTxCXU">Androgen-insensitivity syndrome illustrates several points about the influence of genes on a person’s sex. First, this condition demonstrates that human sexual development is a complex process, influenced not only by the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vIq1Ygx00e">SRY</i> gene on the Y chromosome but also by other genes found elsewhere. Second, it shows that most people carry genes for both male and female characteristics, as illustrated by the fact that those with androgen-insensitivity syndrome have the capacity to develop female characteristics even though they have a Y chromosome. Indeed, the genes for most male and female secondary sex characteristics are present not on the sex chromosomes but on the autosomes. The key to maleness and femaleness lies not in the genes but in the control of their expression. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_PywADXVXOB">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_SmcrK1BCyb" id="ben_9781319297145_G2N23Xfg0G">PROBLEM 17</a></strong></p>
