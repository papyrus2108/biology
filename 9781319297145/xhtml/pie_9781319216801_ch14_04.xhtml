<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_iNaowCigtl">In 1956, Francis Crick proposed the idea of a molecule that transports amino acids to the ribosome and interacts with codons in mRNA, placing the amino acids in their proper order in protein synthesis. By 1963, the existence of such an adapter molecule, called transfer RNA, had been confirmed. Transfer RNA (tRNA) serves as a link between the genetic code in mRNA and the amino acids that make up a protein. Each tRNA attaches to a particular amino acid and carries it to the ribosome, where the tRNA adds its amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain at the position specified by the genetic instructions in the mRNA. We’ll take a closer look at the mechanism of this process in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fX20GwRzso" id="ben_9781319297145_slWrpvY1a5">Chapter 15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TMlei942IN">Each tRNA is capable of attaching to only one type of amino acid. The complex of tRNA plus its amino acid can be written in abbreviated form by adding a three-letter superscript representing the amino acid to the term “tRNA.” For example, a tRNA that attaches to the amino acid alanine is written as tRNA<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_BLuSPe8S7h">Ala</sup>. Because 20 different amino acids are found in proteins, there must be a minimum of 20 different types of tRNA. In fact, most organisms possess at least 30 to 40 different types of tRNA, each encoded by a different gene (or, in some cases, multiple copies of a gene) in DNA.<span aria-label="420" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page420" role="doc-pagebreak" title="420"/></p>
