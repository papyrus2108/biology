<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_lMtD0YdLkU">Rugged, isolated, and pristine, Isle Royale is surrounded by the deep, cold waters of northern Lake Superior. The island is a United States national park and wilderness area, covering only a little over 500 square kilometers of boreal forests and wetlands. Though small and isolated, Isle Royale is famous for its wolves and is home to the longest-running study of predator–prey dynamics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_R4Fu9fibcM">Moose first made it to Isle Royale in the early 1900s, most likely by swimming the 24 km of water that separates the island from the mainland. Because these moose had no natural predators, their numbers on Isle Royale mushroomed; the island’s forest subsequently declined, as moose decimated the birch and aspen trees by browsing. This situation changed in 1949, when a single breeding pair of wolves trekked across the frozen lake in winter and set up residence on the island. The wolves preyed on the moose and kept their population in check. With fewer moose, the island’s trees rebounded. When biologists initiated their study of moose–wolf interaction in 1959, there were 20 wolves and about 500 moose on the island.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zcEy19hAGq">Over the next 50 years, the numbers of wolves and moose on Isle Royale waxed and waned. In 1980, the wolf population reached an all-time high of 50 animals but crashed shortly afterward due to an epidemic of canine parvovirus introduced by a visiting domestic dog. After the epidemic, wolf numbers climbed from 14 to about 20 but remained low throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The wolf population suffered from inbreeding and low genetic variation. As we will see in this chapter, inbreeding and the effects of chance factors operating in small populations (called genetic drift) lead to a loss of genetic variation, which often results in low fertility, birth defects, and lowered resistance to disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_IAKlN613xi">Then, in 1997, a remarkable event occurred. A lone male wolf, later dubbed Old Gray Guy for his light-colored fur, migrated across the winter ice to the island. He joined the Isle Royale wolves and introduced fresh genes that invigorated the population. Old Gray Guy was a prolific breeder. He eventually produced 34 offspring, and his genes came to dominate the population—by 2008, 59.4% of the wolf genes on the island were his. The population climbed to over 30 wolves, and moose numbers declined. Old Gray Guy died in 2006. Unfortunately, he had introduced a limited number of new genes. No more new wolves joined the population, and levels of inbreeding reached a new high (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hcEtMQUUhC" id="ben_9781319297145_EHVZhIiM36"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_i1gU8IHvbr">Figure 25.1</strong></a>). There was no reproduction in 2012, and by early 2013, only 8 wolves were left on the island. Their number dropped further in the following years—by 2016, only 2 wolves remained, a male and female pair. Genetic studies revealed that this pair was highly inbred: they were half siblings (born to the same mother), as well as father and daughter. <span aria-label="766" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page766" role="doc-pagebreak" title="766"/>Freed from wolf predation, the moose population boomed again.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_t7d6Nwq9Gn">Climate warming is one factor complicating the future of wolves on Isle Royale. Genetic studies suggest that Old Gray Guy was not the only wolf to migrate to the island since the population was established in 1949. Several wolves probably joined the population during its history. Migration is possible only during cold winters, when the lake waters freeze for several days to weeks at a time and wolves can walk from the mainland to the island. During the 1960s, ice bridges formed every few years, but recently they have formed much less frequently; climatologists project that Lake Superior will be largely ice free by 2040, cutting off all future wolf migration.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_W7fh4TPtob">As the number of wolves on Isle Royale became precariously low, biologists proposed that additional wolves be transported to the island to counteract the effects of inbreeding.

Others felt that nature should be left to take its course, even if it led to the extinction of the Isle Royale wolf population.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rn0FUQJlUL">After an extensive review, the National Park Service decided to introduce new genetic variation into the population. Four new wolves from Minnesota were broght to Isle Royale in 2018, and another seven wolves from Canada were added in early 2019. As of 2019, there were a total of 15 wolves on the island. The National Park Service plans to introduce up to 30 new wolves in to the population over the next several years.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_cjxJWjgRYs">The wolves of Isle Royale illustrate several important principles of genetics: Small populations lose genetic variation over time through inbreeding and genetic drift, often with catastrophic consequences for survival and reproduction. Migration, whether occurring naturally or through genetic rescue, introduces new genetic variation that counteracts the effects of genetic drift and inbreeding. These principles have important implications not only for wildlife management but also for the evolution of organisms in the natural world.</p>

A population evolves through changes in its gene pool; therefore, population genetics is also the study of evolution. Population geneticists study the variation in alleles within and between groups and the evolutionary forces responsible for shaping the patterns of genetic variation found in nature. In this chapter, we learn how the gene pool of a population is described and what factors are responsible for shaping it.</p>
