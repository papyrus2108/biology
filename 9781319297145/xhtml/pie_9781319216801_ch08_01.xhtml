<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_nlpfTbd9AY">Nothing is more pleasing than the aroma and taste of freshly baked bread. Indeed, cooking, sharing, and eating bread has cultural and religious significance for billions of people around the world. The primary constituent of bread—wheat—is the most widely grown crop on Earth, and foods made from wheat provide almost 20% of all calories consumed by humans worldwide.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iXcTgquf9X">Wheat has a highly complex genome that is a product of its unique evolutionary history. Most eukaryotic organisms are diploid (2<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XDCtXj1MYz">n</i>), consisting of two copies of genetic information, one inherited from each parent. Other organisms, such as fungi, are haploid (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_irtRzlkypT">n</i>), with a single copy of genetic information. But wheat is hexaploid (6<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Ge4NR71a5o">n</i>), with six copies of genetic information derived from three different species (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ltk83jjwR9"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FwpQQi9ocq" id="ben_9781319297145_J1KBgq4VTu">Figure 8.1</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_98UK2VbRTI">Some 10,000 years ago, two diploid grasses crossed, producing a hybrid with 14 chromosomes. The chromosomes of this hybrid then doubled, creating Emmer wheat (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0vmZASxk1w">Triticum turgidum</i>) with 28 chromosomes, which was domesticated by early farmers and is still cultivated in some parts of the world. Several thousand years later, Emmer wheat crossed with a third diploid species (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FwpQQi9ocq" id="ben_9781319297145_cKO4mHQJ0n">Figure 8.1</a>), giving rise to a new hybrid with 21 chromosomes. In the final step, this hybrid underwent yet another mitotic nondisjunction, doubling the chromosomes to produce modern wheat (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_8afujdnvHc">Triticum aestivum</i>) with 42 chromosomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pcT34LEK0D">Over the ages, wheat has been subjected to selective breeding and genetic manipulation. Genetic modification of wheat in recent years, however, has been limited by the absence of detailed information about its genetic makeup. In 2005, a group of wheat farmers in Kansas saw the potential benefits of more genetic information and initiated an effort to sequence the wheat genome. This led to a large effort known as the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tgGdIZTpYV">Sequencing the genome of wheat turned out to be a huge task. Wheat has a large genome, consisting of about 17 billion base pairs of DNA, compared to the human genome, with 3.2 billion base pairs. In addition, 85% of wheat’s genome is made up of short, repeated DNA sequences, which are difficult to assemble into a full genome. Wheat’s genome sequencing ultimately required 13 years to complete and the efforts of more than 200 scientists from 20 countries. The entire wheat genome was finally sequenced in 2017, and a fully annotated and assembled genome was published in 2018. The researchers identified 107,891 protein-encoding genes, over five times as many as in humans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_E2r69pPrgX">The completed genome sequence of wheat will allow researchers and plant breeders to more rapidly identify key genes involved in yield, nutrition, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. It will undoubtedly aid in the breeding of new varieties that can be used to help feed the world’s growing population. Already, researchers have used the genome sequence to find new genes that affect grain size, plant architecture, and the length of the wheat breeding cycle. Other researchers have identified a number of genes for proteins that cause immune responses in humans, which may help in the creation of new wheat varieties that are less allergenic.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ODqVfpbepA">Most species have a characteristic number of chromosomes, each with a distinct size and structure, and all the tissues of an organism (except for gametes) generally have the same set of chromosomes. Nevertheless, variations in chromosome number—such as the extra sets of chromosomes seen in wheat—do periodically arise. Variations may also arise in chromosome structure: individual chromosomes may lose or gain parts, and the order of genes within a chromosome may be altered. These variations in the number and structure of chromosomes are termed
