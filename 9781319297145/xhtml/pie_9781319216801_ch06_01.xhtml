<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_WgpkR347cK">In 2007, a 29-year-old Swiss woman attempted to enter the United States. Although her appearance matched the photograph on her passport, she failed a fingerprint check, not because her fingerprints matched those of a terrorist, but rather because she had no fingerprints at all—her fingers were completely devoid of any prints. She was delayed for several hours as puzzled immigration officials tried to decide what to do about a person with no fingerprints.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_WvPG9mCg80">Fingerprints are among our most unique and permanent traits. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprints. Fingerprints are technically termed <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Eav5iEEu7j">epidermal ridges</i> or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Al7VAtRnjI">dermatoglyphic patterns</i>; these patterns are found on our fingers, toes, palms, and the soles of our feet. Epidermal ridges appear long before birth—they are fully formed by the 17th week of pregnancy—and are permanent for life. Research shows that fingerprint patterns are clearly influenced by heredity, but random factors also play a role. One of the first scientists to study fingerprints was Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. In the late 1800s, Galton established that no two individuals have the same fingerprints and showed that fingerprints of relatives are more similar than those of unrelated people.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_F9rxgOCjru">The complete absence of fingerprints, as exhibited by the Swiss woman at the airport, is an extremely rare condition known as adermatoglyphia (ADG). Dubbed “immigration delay disease” because of the hassle it creates when people with the condition attempt to cross borders, ADG has been documented in only a few people from four families around the world. In ADG, fingerprints are absent at birth and never develop. Otherwise, the disorder produces no harmful effects.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BadsxmlUCN">In 2011, geneticists in Israel and Switzerland solved the mystery of missing fingerprints in people with ADG. Janna Nousbeck and her colleagues examined the condition in a large Swiss family in which some members had normal fingerprints and <span aria-label="150" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" role="doc-pagebreak" title="150"/>other members were missing them entirely (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ixl5k59ymG" id="ben_9781319297145_YaAtKaXuGg"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_5Ox0U4iyo4">Figure 6.1</strong></a>). In this family, ADG exhibits the hallmark characteristics of an autosomal dominant trait. The researchers took blood samples from family members who lacked fingerprints and from those with normal fingerprints. They extracted DNA from the blood and genotyped the family members for 6000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are DNA sequences that vary in a single nucleotide. By comparing the SNPs of family members with and without fingerprints, they were able to determine that the gene for ADG was located in a specific interval on the long arm of chromosome 4. One of the genes in this region is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BVDchZIfYN">SMARCAD1</i>, which encodes a short form of a protein found exclusively in the skin. Sequencing of the gene revealed that family members with ADG possessed a mutation not found in those with fingerprints. The mutation causes abnormal splicing in RNA transcribed from the gene, with the result that the RNA is less stable. How the decreased stability of this RNA leads to ADG is not known, but scientists hope that the identification of this gene will lead to a better understanding of how fingerprints develop.</p>

Generation 2 has 1 female with the condition, one female without the condition, and one male with the condition. Both of the siblings with adermatoglyphia mate with unaffected people and have offspring. In generation 3, the positive female from generation 2 has 2 male offspring with the condition, a set of twin females without the condition, and 1 female without the condition. From these siblings, one of the positive males mates with a female and both of their female offspring in generation 4 are positive for adermatoglyphia. The positive male from generation 2 has 2 male offspring and 1 female offspring in generation 3 and all of them have adermatoglyphia.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_6q875QxtwB">The absence of fingerprints is just one of a large number of human traits and diseases that are currently the focus of intensive genetic research. In this chapter, we consider human genetic characteristics and examine three important techniques used by geneticists to investigate these characteristics: pedigrees, twin studies, and adoption studies. At the end of the chapter, we see how the information garnered with these techniques can be used in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wLrhwWoKuU">Keep in mind as you read this chapter that many important characteristics are influenced by both genes and environment, and that separating these factors in humans is always difficult. Studies of twins and adopted people are designed to distinguish the effects of genes and environment, but such studies are based on assumptions that may be difficult to meet for some human characteristics, particularly behavioral ones. Therefore, it’s always prudent to interpret the results of such studies with caution.</p>
