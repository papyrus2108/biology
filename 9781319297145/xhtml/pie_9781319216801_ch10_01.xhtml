<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_1j2fUHOpVs">Deep in the Altai mountains of Siberia lies the Denisova cave, famous for its accumulation of fossils and animal remains. In 2018, scientists extracted DNA from a 90,000-year-old human bone found in the cave and sequenced its owner’s genome. Analysis revealed that there were two copies of sequences located on the X chromosome, indicating that the bone came from a female. The thickness of the bone suggested that she was at least 13 years old at the time of her death. Researchers named this ancient woman Denny. Remarkably, Denny’s DNA showed that she was a hybrid between two now-extinct groups of early humans (hominins), the result of a mating between a Neanderthal woman and a Denisovan man.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cOXxATTsZQ">Denisovans were first discovered in 2009, when scientists found a single 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave. Although the bone was too fragmentary to draw any conclusion about its origin based on anatomy, scientists successfully extracted DNA from it. They were able to sequence and reconstruct the person’s entire genome from that extracted DNA. Study of this genome revealed that the bone came from a new hominin, related to Neanderthals but distinct from Neanderthals and other known hominins. These people were given the name Denisovans, after the cave from which the bone came. Researchers have since found traces of Denisovan DNA in some present-day humans in Southeast Asia, suggesting that early <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_SpufJPr8MX">Homo sapiens</i> and Denisovans also interbred. Both Neanderthals and Denisovans have long since disappeared, perhaps outcompeted or exterminated by <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_IjH96OJod5">Homo sapiens</i> some 40,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XpL4Hzr6iV">The researchers who examined Denny’s genome found that 39% of her DNA came from Neanderthals and 42% came from Denisovans, demonstrating that both species contributed equally to her ancestry. Further analysis revealed that Denny possessed a level of heterozygosity expected if she had inherited one set of chromosomes from a Neanderthal mother and the other set from a Denisovan father. The data were unequivocal: Denny was an F<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_ykZIbcpm6F">1</sub> hybrid between the two species. Examination revealed that Denny’s Denisovan father possessed some Neanderthal DNA himself, indicating that earlier matings between Denisovans and Neanderthals took place in Denny’s distant ancestors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QfcyktGo1l">DNA, with its double-stranded spiral, is among the most elegant of all biological molecules, but the double helix is not just a beautiful structure; it also gives DNA incredible stability and permanence, as evidenced by our ability to extract and sequence <span aria-label="294" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page294" role="doc-pagebreak" title="294"/>DNA from a 90,000-year-old bone, revealing startlingly intimate details of ancient family life. In an even more incredible feat, geneticists in 2013 sequenced the genome of a long-extinct ancestral horse from DNA extracted from a 700,000-year-old bone fragment recovered from the permafrost of Yukon, Canada.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Q0eUQTQteu">This chapter focuses on how DNA was identified as the source of genetic information and on how it encodes the genetic instructions for all life. We begin by considering the basic requirements for the genetic material and the history of the study of DNA—how its relation to genes was uncovered and its structure determined. The history of DNA illustrates several important points about the nature of scientific research. As with so many important scientific advances, the structure of DNA and its role as the genetic material were not discovered by any single person but were gradually revealed over a period of almost 100 years, thanks to the work of many investigators. Our understanding of the relation between DNA and genes was enormously enhanced in 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick, analyzing data provided by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, proposed a three-dimensional structure for DNA that brilliantly illuminated its role in genetics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tpjpwAIvqT">After reviewing the discoveries that led to our current understanding of DNA, we examine DNA structure. While the structure of DNA is important in its own right, the key genetic concept is the relation between the structure and the function of DNA—that is, how its structure allows it to serve as the genetic material.</p>
