<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4pmsIbOyb1">The first evidence that people understood and applied the principles of heredity in earlier times is found in the domestication of plants and animals, which began between approximately 10,000 and 12,000 years ago; early farming villages appeared in the Middle East between 11,000 and 11,500 years ago. The first domesticated organisms included wheat, peas, lentils, barley, dogs, goats, and sheep (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_HLaNqrBE7Q"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JtpRh1rjz1" id="ben_9781319297145_7CxDtgZupr">Figure 1.9a</a></strong>). By 4000 years ago, genetic techniques of selective breeding were already in use in the Middle East. The Assyrians and Babylonians developed several hundred varieties of date palms that differed in fruit size, color, taste, and time of ripening (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_JtpRh1rjz1" id="ben_9781319297145_RQ3ZkZU0CU"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_YsMDqG7Flx">Figure 1.9b</strong></a>). Other crops and domesticated animals were developed by cultures in Asia, Africa, and the Americas in the same period.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7omggbDOSQ">Ancient writings demonstrate that early humans were also aware of their own heredity. Hindu sacred writings dating to 2000 years ago suggest that many traits are inherited from the father and that differences between siblings are produced by the mother. The Talmud—the Jewish book of religious laws based on oral traditions dating back thousands of—years, presents an uncannily accurate understanding of the inheritance of hemophilia. It directs that if a woman bears two sons who die of bleeding after circumcision any additional sons that she bears should not be circumcised, nor should the sons of her sisters be circumcised. This advice accurately corresponds to the X-linked pattern of inheritance of hemophilia (discussed further in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch06_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_s10J9su133">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_018aHOwUp5">Some early concepts of heredity were incorrect but reflect human interest in heredity and our attempts to explain the inheritance of traits.

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was a proponent of this idea and incorporated it into his theory of biological change. The notion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics is also no longer accepted, but it remained popular through the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lCuLLMX5na">Although the ancient Romans contributed little to an understanding of human heredity, they successfully developed a number of techniques for animal and plant breeding; their techniques were based on trial and error rather than any general concept of heredity. Little new information was added to the understanding of genetics in the next thousand years.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_4fD8eISzo6">Additional developments in our understanding of heredity occurred during the seventeenth century. Dutch eyeglass makers began to put together simple microscopes in the late <span aria-label="9" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" role="doc-pagebreak" title="9"/>1500s, enabling Robert Hooke (1635–1703) to discover cells in 1665.

Preformationism meant that all traits were inherited from only one parent—from the father if the homunculus was in the sperm or from the mother if it was in the egg. Although many observations suggested that offspring possess a mixture of traits from both parents, preformationism remained a popular concept throughout much of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_WeMlfF3KbU">In 1676, Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) reported that plants reproduce sexually. With this information, a number of botanists began to experiment with crossing plants and creating hybrids, including Gregor Mendel (1822–1884; <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_P3RT4QALeF"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Y5Lv84DAjv" id="ben_9781319297145_eP8Ud4J25d">Figure 1.12</a></strong>), who went on to discover the basic principles of heredity. Mendel’s conclusions, which were not widely known in the scientific community until 35 years after their publication, laid the foundation for our modern understanding of heredity, and he is generally recognized today as the father of genetics.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XMs8yC1Lna">Developments in cytology (the study of cells) in the 1800s had a strong influence on genetics. Robert Brown (1773–1858) described the cell nucleus in 1833. Building on the work of others, Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804–1881) and Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) proposed the concept that came to be known as the

According to this theory, all life is composed of cells, cells arise only from preexisting cells, and the cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. Biologists interested in heredity began to examine cells to see what took place in the course of cell reproduction. Walther Flemming (1843–1905) observed the division of chromosomes in 1879 and published a superb description of mitosis. By 1885, biologists generally recognized that the cell nucleus contains the hereditary information.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EcbUdAHukz">Charles Darwin (1809–1882), one of the most influential biologists of the nineteenth century, put forth the theory of evolution through natural selection and published his ideas in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_GtBYJqn53a">On the Origin of Species</i> in 1859. Darwin recognized that heredity was fundamental to evolution, and he conducted extensive genetic crosses with pigeons and other organisms. He never understood the nature of inheritance, however, and this lack of understanding was a major omission in his theory of evolution.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_X8KIYFUzrH">In the last half of the nineteenth century, cytologists demonstrated that the nucleus had a role in fertilization. Near the close of that century, August Weismann (1834–1914) finally laid to rest the notion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He cut off the tails of mice for 22 consecutive generations and showed that the tail length in descendants remained stubbornly long. Weismann proposed the

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_npfDLBMecP">The year 1900 was a watershed in the history of genetics. Gregor Mendel’s pivotal 1866 publication on experiments with pea plants, which revealed the principles of heredity (considered in more detail in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lgF7rF7G1D" id="ben_9781319297145_nrQBE2UCdA">Chapter 3</a>), was rediscovered. Once the significance of his conclusions was recognized, other biologists immediately began to conduct similar genetic studies on mice, chickens, and other organisms.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wYOkl1wpjt">In 1902, after the acceptance of Mendel’s theory of heredity, Walter Sutton (1877–1916) proposed that genes, the units of inheritance, are located on chromosomes. Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866–1945) discovered the first mutant fruit fly in 1910 and used fruit flies to unravel many details of transmission genetics. Ronald A. Fisher (1890–1962), John B. S. Haldane (1892–1964), and Sewall Wright (1889–1988) laid the foundation for population genetics in the 1930s by integrating Mendelian genetics and evolutionary theory.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_BxOiIlXhTj">Geneticists began to use bacteria and viruses in the 1940s; the rapid reproduction and simple genetic systems of these organisms allowed detailed study of the organization and structure of their genes. At about this same time, evidence accumulated that DNA was the repository of genetic information. James Watson (b. 1928) and Francis Crick (1916–2004), along with Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) and Maurice Wilkins (1916–2004), described the three-dimensional structure of DNA in 1953, ushering in the era of molecular genetics (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_3CquMTQoBr">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EhaQKtGwfA">By 1966, the chemical structure of DNA and the system by which it determines the amino acid sequence of proteins had been worked out. Advances in molecular genetics led to the first recombinant DNA experiments in 1973, which provided techniques for combining genetic material from different sources and touched off another revolution in genetic research. <span aria-label="11" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" role="doc-pagebreak" title="11"/>Walter Gilbert (b. 1932) and Frederick Sanger (1918–2013) developed methods for sequencing DNA in 1977. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique for quickly amplifying tiny amounts of DNA, was developed by Kary Mullis (1944–2019) and others in 1983. PCR has subsequently become one of the most widely used tools in molecular biology.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_aTLIkgWEMC">In 1990, gene therapy was used for the first time to treat human genetic disease in the United States, and the Human Genome Project was launched. By 1995, the first complete DNA sequence of a free-living organism—the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_YsV9xu8T72">Haemophilus influenzae</i>—had been determined, and the first complete sequence of a eukaryotic organism (yeast) was reported a year later. A rough draft of the human genome sequence was reported in 2000 (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_LInspUXy7O">Chapter 20</a>), and the sequence was essentially completed in 2003, bringing in another new era in genetics. Building on prior research by several groups, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier in 2012 modified the CRISPR-Cas system found in bacteria to develop a powerful new technology for editing the genome. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_f0CTJJqhJ6">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch01_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CP7yQRBzB8" id="ben_9781319297145_wLcz2LVBSQ">PROBLEM 23</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yWfRtsBq4h">With exciting advances being made every year, genetics remains at the forefront of biological research. Rapid methods for sequencing DNA are being used to sequence the genomes of numerous species, from cockroaches to orangutans to hot peppers to roses. New DNA sequencing techniques are capable of sequencing single DNA molecules, allowing longer and longer sequence reads that facilitate assembling of whole genomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_c7ZiN7feb4">Genetics continues to play a major role in agriculture. For example, many people complain about the bland taste of store-bought tomatoes. Geneticists are now using modern genetic techniques to locate genes that are responsible for loss of flavor in commercial tomatoes. In one study, researchers quantified natural compounds that enhance flavor in 400 varieties of tomatoes and identified compounds that were missing or low in poor-tasting commercial varieties. They then used genome sequencing to identify genes that affect the missing flavors, and this information is being used to breed back into commercial varieties compounds that enhance flavor, producing better-tasting tomatoes. Other plant scientists are studying the genetics of volatile organic compounds in flowers, with the goal of engineering fragrance. There is currently a project underway to completely sequence the genomes of 10,000 plant species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VTb4N5bXfp">Today, genomic studies provide key insights into evolution. For example, how many types of giraffes are there? Previously, biologists thought there was a single species, but analysis of DNA sequences has now revealed the presence of four distinct species. In 2016, researchers identified the gene responsible for the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths of Britain, where dark moths became more frequent during times of pollution. They discovered that the mutation that produced the dark (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vite1wjPE4">carbonaria</i>) form of the moths was a large transposable element (a mobile genetic sequence) which inserted into a gene that normally controls cell division and wing development in moths. Whereas archaeologists previously studied fossils, ancient pottery, and tools to understand human ancestry, researchers are now isolating DNA from ancient remains to reconstruct human history. Genome sequences have been analyzed from more than 1000 ancient humans and are being used to answer important questions about the spread of agriculture, the development of languages, and human migration. Genome sequencing of ancient DNA has demonstrated that early <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vz7iL501oy">Homo sapiens</i> interbred with other hominins, including Neanderthals and Denisovans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UrMvSelKEX">Other researchers are unraveling genetic underpinnings of development. Snakes evolved from four-legged ancestors but began to lose their limbs about 150 million years ago. Today, most snakes have lost all vestiges of their limbs (although a few species such as pythons have vestigial pelvises and leg bones). Geneticists have now isolated genes that control the absence of limbs in snakes. When genetic engineers inserted a snake version of an enhancer (a genetic element that controls gene expression) into mice, these mice developed truncated limbs instead of legs.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ReKfluekRQ"><span aria-label="12" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" role="doc-pagebreak" title="12"/>New research has made CRISPR-Cas9—the powerful genome editing technology that is now widely used in genetic research—more accurate and flexible than ever. New developments have harnessed the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to provide additional functions, including detection of DNA molecules, editing of RNA, activation of gene expression, and changing of specific base pairs of DNA. CRISPR-Cas was recently used to successfully repair defective genes that cause heart disease in human embryos.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_o0aH9VmsTh">Genetic research continues to provide important information and tools for medicine. Researchers are developing blood tests that detect DNA and proteins shed by tumors, providing the potential for early detection of cancer. Genetics information is being used to develop vaccines to combat infectious diseases such as HIV, Zika, and Ebola. And human gene therapy is being harnessed to treat a number of diseases and disorders, including leukemia, blindness, deafness, blood disorders, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Recently researchers have identified genes that allow Tibetans to live in high altitudes and other genes that allow traditional divers in Southeast Asia to stay underwater for longer periods of time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_EK9g4E5xWn">As sequencing becomes more affordable, the focus of DNA-sequencing efforts is shifting from the genomes of different species to individual differences within species. In the not-too-distant future, many people will possess a copy of their entire genome sequence, which can be used to help assess the risk of acquiring various diseases and to tailor their treatment should they arise. This ever-widening scope of genetics raises significant ethical, social, and economic issues.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_L8KgNRpswQ">This brief overview of the history of genetics, from the first domestication of crops to present-day whole-genome sequencing, is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, it is designed to provide a sense of the accelerating pace of advances in genetics. In the chapters to come, we will learn more about the experiments and the scientists who helped shape the discipline of genetics.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_826oGJKgLe">Humans first applied genetic methods to the domestication of plants and animals between approximately 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. Developments in plant hybridization and cytology in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries laid the foundation for the field of genetics today. After Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900, the science of genetics developed rapidly, and today it is one of the most active areas of science.</p>
