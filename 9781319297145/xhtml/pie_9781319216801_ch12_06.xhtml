This process takes place in crossing over, in which homologous regions of chromosomes are exchanged and alleles are shuffled into new combinations (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H7TcuxGaeK" id="ben_9781319297145_u46srWBc2d">Figure 7.5</a>). Recombination is an extremely important genetic process because it increases genetic variation. Rates of recombination provide important information about linkage relations among genes, which is used to create genetic maps (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_XI7cAvWzeU" id="ben_9781319297145_ZCsYJljsde">Figures 7.13</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GJ14DCE2qP" id="ben_9781319297145_s9YtOhhvp0">7.14</a>).

In this complicated series of events, no genetic information is lost or gained. Although the precise molecular mechanism of homologous recombination is still not completely understood, the exchange is probably accomplished through the pairing of complementary bases. A single nucleotide strand of one chromosome pairs with the complementary strand of another, forming

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6zrN8ghb2y">In meiosis, homologous recombination (crossing over) could theoretically take place before, during, or after DNA synthesis. Cytological, biochemical, and genetic evidence indicates that it takes place in prophase I of meiosis, whereas DNA replication takes place earlier, in interphase. Thus, crossing over must entail the breaking and rejoining of chromatids when homologous chromosomes are at the four-strand stage (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_H7TcuxGaeK" id="ben_9781319297145_IcCErAVZvi">Figure 7.5</a>).

In this model, the double-stranded DNA molecules of two homologous chromosomes align precisely. A single-strand break in each of the DNA molecules provides a free end that invades and joins the free end of the other DNA molecule. Thus, strand invasion and joining take place on both DNA molecules, creating two heteroduplex DNAs, each consisting of one original strand plus one new strand from the other DNA molecule. The point at which the nucleotide strands pass from one DNA molecule to the other is the Holliday junction. The junction moves along the molecules in a process called branch migration.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zdGaBPS63w">Evidence for the double-strand-break model originally came from results of genetic crosses in yeast that could not be explained by the Holliday model. Subsequent observations showed that double-strand breaks appear in yeast in prophase I, when crossing over takes place, and that mutant strains that are unable to form double-strand breaks do not exhibit meiotic recombination. Although considerable evidence supports the double-strand-break model in yeast, the extent to which it applies to other organisms is not yet known.</p>
