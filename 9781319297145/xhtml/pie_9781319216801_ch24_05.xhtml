<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_AF6B3szoyB">When a quantitative characteristic is subjected to natural or artificial selection, it frequently changes with the passage of time, provided that there is genetic variation for that characteristic in the population. Let’s return to the dairy farmer who wants to increase milk production among the cows in the farmer’s herd. Variation at several loci potentially affects milk production in cows; some alleles at these loci confer high milk production, whereas others confer low milk production. The dairy farmer breeds only those cows in the herd that have the highest milk production. If there is genetic variation for milk production in the herd (i.e., there are different alleles at the loci that control milk production), the mean milk production in the offspring of the selected cows should be higher than the mean milk production of the original herd. This increased production is due to the fact that the selected cows possess more alleles for high milk production than does the average cow, and these alleles are passed on to the offspring. Thus, the offspring of the selected cows possess a higher proportion of alleles for high milk production, and therefore produce more milk, than the average cow in the original herd.</p>

Suppose that the average cow in a dairy herd produces 80 liters of milk per week. A farmer selects for increased milk production by breeding the highest milk producers, and the female progeny of those selected cows produce 100 liters of milk per week on average. The response to selection is calculated by subtracting the mean phenotype of the original population (80 liters) from the mean phenotype of the offspring (100 liters). In our example, the response to selection is 100 − 80 = 20 liters of milk per week.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_vUAmarXjrM">The response to selection is determined primarily by two factors. First, it is affected by narrow-sense heritability, which largely determines the degree of resemblance between parents and offspring. When narrow-sense heritability is high, offspring will tend to resemble their parents; conversely, when narrow-sense heritability is low, there will be little resemblance between parents and offspring.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DqL0Uz7ajb">The second factor that determines the response to selection is how much selection there is. If the farmer is very stringent in the choice of parents and breeds only the highest milk producers in the herd (say, the top 2 cows), then all the offspring will receive genes for high milk production. If the farmer is less selective and breeds the top 20 milk producers in the herd, then the offspring will not carry as many genes for high milk production, and on average, they will not produce as much milk as the offspring of the top 2 producers. The response to selection depends on the phenotypic difference of the individuals that are selected as parents. This phenotypic difference is measured by the

If the average milk production of the original herd is 80 liters and the farmer breeds cows with an average milk production of 120 liters, then the selection differential is 120 − 80 = 40 liters.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xpCBdQhtnA">When a characteristic has been selected for many generations, the response may eventually level off, and the characteristic may no longer respond to selection (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_I9CDFjrx6X"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_me9dw5MsmU" id="ben_9781319297145_2LOIEaC35x">Figure 24.23</a></strong>). A potential reason for this leveling off is that the genetic variation in the population is exhausted; at some point, all individuals in the population may have become homozygous for the alleles that encode the selected trait. When there is no more additive genetic variance, heritability equals zero, and no further response to selection can take place.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_DuyvEABAjC">Sometimes the response to selection levels off even while some genetic variation remains in the population. This leveling off takes place because natural selection opposes further change in the characteristic. The response to selection for small body size in mice, for example, eventually levels off <span aria-label="755" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page755" role="doc-pagebreak" title="755"/>because the smallest animals are sterile and cannot pass on their genes for small body size. In this case, artificial selection for small size is opposed by natural selection for fertility, and the population can no longer respond to the artificial selection.</p>

Phenotypic correlations may be due to environmental or genetic correlations. Environmental correlations refer to two or more characteristics that are influenced by the same environmental factor. Moisture availability, for example, may affect both the size of a plant and the number of seeds it produces. Plants growing in environments with lots of water are large and produce many seeds, whereas plants growing in environments with limited water are small and have few seeds.</p>

The primary genetic cause of phenotypic correlations is pleiotropy, the effect of one gene on two or more characteristics (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_si9S9AUN4i" id="ben_9781319297145_leHgPpXhG4">Section 5.5</a>). In humans, for example, many body structures respond to growth hormone, and there are genes that affect the amount of growth hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. People with certain genotypes produce high levels of growth hormone, which increases both height and hand size. Those with other genotypes produce lower levels of growth hormone, which leads to both short stature and small hands. Height and hand size are therefore phenotypically correlated in humans, and this correlation is due to a genetic correlation—the fact that both characteristics are affected by the same genes that control the amount of growth hormone. Genetically speaking, height and hand size are the same characteristic because they are the phenotypic manifestation of a single set of genes. When two characteristics are influenced by the same genes, they are genetically correlated.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_uqfZhSqqON">Genetic correlations are quite common (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ZwifDB81js"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Ltvtcpv2cN" id="ben_9781319297145_VhDBtDmZod">Table 24.4</a></strong>) and may be positive or negative. A positive genetic correlation between two characteristics means that genes that cause an increase in one characteristic also produce an increase in the other characteristic. Thorax length and wing length in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_cPwQr11tuq">Drosophila</i> are positively correlated because the genes that increase thorax length also increase wing length. A negative genetic correlation means that genes that cause an increase in one characteristic produce a decrease in the other characteristic. Milk yield and percentage of butterfat are negatively correlated in cattle: genes that cause higher milk production result in milk with a lower percentage of butterfat.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_51HcqlQ3iU">Genetic correlations are important in animal and plant breeding because they produce a correlated response to selection, which means that when one characteristic is selected, genetically correlated characteristics also change. Correlated responses to selection are due to the fact that both characteristics are influenced by the same genes; selection for one characteristic causes a change in the genes affecting that characteristic, and because those genes also affect the second characteristic, they cause it to change at the same time. Correlated responses may well be undesirable <span aria-label="756" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page756" role="doc-pagebreak" title="756"/>and may limit our ability to alter a characteristic by selection. From 1944 to 1964, for example, domesticated turkeys were subjected to intense selection for growth rate and body size. At the same time, fertility, egg production, and egg hatchability all declined. These correlated responses were due to negative genetic correlations between body size and fertility. Eventually, these genetic correlations limited the extent to which the growth rate of turkeys could respond to selection. Genetic correlations may also limit the ability of natural populations to respond to selection in the wild and adapt to their environments. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Ey7cII3Djn">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_07.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_4mhaqSk8oO" id="ben_9781319297145_VeZI4sgz43">PROBLEM 47</a></strong></p>
