<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_U3lj388bAa">Now that we are familiar with the genetic code, we can begin to study how amino acids are assembled into proteins. Because more is known about translation in bacteria than in eukaryotes, we will focus primarily on bacterial translation. In most respects, eukaryotic translation is similar, although some significant differences will be noted.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NgcQ6GQA2Y">Remember that only mRNAs are translated into proteins. Translation takes place on ribosomes; indeed, ribosomes can be thought of as moving protein-synthesizing machines. Through a variety of techniques, a detailed view of the structure of the ribosome has been produced in recent years, which has greatly improved our understanding of translation. A ribosome attaches near the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_hXgGcJqIlj">′</sup> end of an mRNA strand and moves toward the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_bLJBdt8m6B">′</sup> end, translating the codons as it goes (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_i0qQyB7adc" id="ben_9781319297145_LZDqNcppaI"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_cOgNIwmeHU">Figure 15.12</strong></a>). Synthesis begins at the amino end of the protein, and the protein is elongated by the addition of new amino acids to the carboxyl end. Protein synthesis includes a series of RNA–RNA interactions: interactions <span aria-label="447" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page447" role="doc-pagebreak" title="447"/>between the mRNA and the rRNA that holds the mRNA in the ribosome, between the codon on the mRNA and the anticodon on the tRNA, and between the tRNA and the rRNAs of the ribosome.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cOwDEKG5Mb">Protein synthesis can be conveniently divided into four stages: (1) tRNA charging, in which tRNAs bind to amino acids; (2) initiation, in which the components necessary for translation are assembled at the ribosome; (3) elongation, in which amino acids are joined, one at a time, to the growing polypeptide chain; and (4) termination, in which protein synthesis halts at the termination codon and the translation components are released from the ribosome.</p>

This fidelity is due in part to the presence of editing (proofreading) activity in many of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Editing activity detects incorrectly paired amino acids and removes them from the tRNAs. Some antifungal chemical agents work by trapping tRNAs in the editing site of the synthetases, preventing their release and thus inhibiting the process of translation in the fungi.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_rXikQgZkwz">Similar events take place in the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, but there are some important differences. In bacterial cells, sequences in 16S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit bind to the Shine–Dalgarno sequence in mRNA. No analogous consensus sequence exists in eukaryotic mRNA. Instead, the cap at the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_msBnOtYtxu">′</sup> end of eukaryotic mRNA plays a critical role in the initiation of translation. In a series of steps, the small subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome, initiation factors, and the initiator tRNA with its amino acid (Met-tRNA<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_4TEDKuvY1u">i</sub><sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_Kw0YmxFoMi">Met</sup>) form an initiation complex that recognizes the cap and binds there. The initiation complex then moves along (scans) the mRNA until it locates the first AUG codon. The identification of the start codon is facilitated by the presence of a consensus sequence (called the Kozak sequence) that surrounds the start codon:</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_kASBoq1cAQ">Once the initiation codon is reached, scanning ceases and the anticodon on initiator tRNA pairs with the start codon on the mRNA.

This complex enters the A site of the ribosome, where the anticodon on the tRNA pairs with the codon on the mRNA. Once the charged tRNA is in the A site, GTP is cleaved to form GDP, and the EF-Tu–GDP complex is released (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rBSSXJKVRU" id="ben_9781319297145_B1VyHL4JKV"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_uXlooMgEnf">Figure 15.19c</strong></a>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_XAf8u6ZRhH">The second step of elongation is the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids that are attached to tRNAs in the P and A sites (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rBSSXJKVRU" id="ben_9781319297145_MSXvS990qb"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_bFESoWKj1l">Figure 15.19d</strong></a>). The formation of this peptide bond releases the amino acid in the P site from its tRNA. Peptide-bond formation occurs within the large ribosomal subunit. The catalytic activity that creates the peptide bond is a property of one of the rRNA components of the large subunit (the 23S rRNA in bacteria, the 28S RNA in eukaryotes); this rRNA acts as a ribozyme (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_08.xhtml#page372" id="ben_9781319297145_pEQvSdmTAb">p. 372 in Chapter 13</a>).</p>

Because the tRNAs in the P and A sites are still attached to the mRNA by codon–anticodon pairing, they do not move with the ribosome as it translocates. Consequently, the ribosome shifts so that the tRNA that previously occupied the P site now occupies the E site, from which it then moves into the cytoplasm, where it can be recharged with another amino acid. Translocation also causes the tRNA that occupied the A site (which is attached to the growing polypeptide chain) to occupy the P site, leaving the A site open. Thus, the progress of each tRNA through the ribosome in the course of elongation can be summarized as follows: cytoplasm → A site → P site → E site → cytoplasm. As stated earlier, the initiator tRNA is an exception: it attaches directly to the P site and never occupies the A site.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_re1FY0PwdC">After translocation, the A site of the ribosome is empty and ready to receive the tRNA specified by the next codon. The elongation cycle (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rBSSXJKVRU" id="ben_9781319297145_WlWiHqfZFn">Figure 15.19b</a>–<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_rBSSXJKVRU" id="ben_9781319297145_lQEPiNyAGc">e</a>) repeats itself: a charged tRNA and its amino acid occupy the A site, a peptide bond is formed between the amino acids in the A and P sites, and the ribosome translocates to the next codon. Throughout the cycle, the polypeptide chain remains attached to the tRNA in the P site. Another protein, called elongation factor P (EF-P), enhances the translation of proteins that contain consecutive copies of the amino acid proline. If EF-P is absent, ribosomes often stall during the translation of such polyproline-containing proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_789bFOYekw">Messenger RNAs, although single stranded, often contain secondary structures formed by the pairing of complementary bases on different parts of the mRNA molecule (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_8vnzMt4PlN" id="ben_9781319297145_Mi8dDDbD4H">Figure 13.1b</a>). As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, these secondary structures are unwound by helicase activity located in the small ribosomal subunit.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iRsKTa9MWL">Researchers have developed methods for following a single ribosome as it translates individual codons of an mRNA molecule. These studies have revealed that translation does not take place in a smooth, continuous fashion. Each translocation of the ribosome typically requires less than a tenth of a second, but sometimes there are distinct pauses, often lasting a few seconds, between translocations. Thus, translation takes place in a series of quick translocations interrupted by brief pauses. In addition to the short pauses between translocation events, translation may be interrupted by longer pauses—lasting from 1 to 2 minutes—which may play a role in regulating the process of translation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2OqB4oLlct">Elongation in eukaryotic cells takes place in a manner similar to that in bacteria. Eukaryotes possess at least three elongation factors, one of which also acts in initiation and termination. Another of these elongation factors, called eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), is the target of a toxin produced by the bacterium that causes diphtheria, a disease that until recently was a leading killer of children. The diphtheria toxin inhibits eEF-2, preventing the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA, and protein synthesis ceases.<span aria-label="452" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page452" role="doc-pagebreak" title="452"/><span aria-label="453" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page453" role="doc-pagebreak" title="453"/></p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_grTYAKteIQ">Research shows that some bacterial ribosomes engage in a type of proofreading, similar to the proofreading that DNA polymerases perform during replication. After translocation, the ribosome checks the interaction between the mRNA and the tRNA in the P site. If the wrong tRNA was added, the alignment between the mRNA and the tRNA will be incorrect, which will trigger premature termination of translation. Evidence suggests that an important function of RF-3 is to help bring about termination of translation when the wrong tRNA has been used. You can explore the process of bacterial translation by examining the consequences of various mutations in the coding region of a gene in <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-med inline" id="ben_9781319297145_vJlQfv7uXh" role="presentation" src="../images/piercegenetics7e_02_pg26.png"/><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_10zosMmFhV"> Animation 15.1</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_phpLtYuMr9">Translation in eukaryotic cells terminates in a similar way, except that there are two release factors: eRF-1, which recognizes all three termination codons, and eRF-2, which binds GTP and stimulates the release of the polypeptide from the ribosome.

<p class="subtitle" epub:type="subtitle" id="ben_9781319297145_U2R4UBwQW5" role="doc-subtitle">A Comparison of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Translation</p></header>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_eIl0qu33Bn">We have now considered the process of translation in bacterial cells and noted some distinctive differences that exist in eukaryotic cells. Let’s reflect on some of the important similarities and differences between protein synthesis in bacterial and in eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Kt1adNEptJ">First, we should emphasize that the genetic code of bacterial and eukaryotic cells is virtually identical; the only difference is in the amino acid specified by the initiation codon. In bacterial cells, the initiation codon AUG encodes a modified type of methionine, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_uM6HhVdAgR">N</i>-formylmethionine, whereas in eukaryotic cells, AUG encodes unformylated methionine. One consequence of the fact that bacteria and eukaryotes use the same genetic code is that eukaryotic genes can be translated in bacterial systems, and vice versa; this feature makes genetic engineering possible, as we will see in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_P5BqOhOtJD">Chapter 19</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_fFxoO0AhqG">Another difference is that transcription and translation take place simultaneously in bacterial cells, but the nuclear envelope separates these processes in eukaryotic cells. The physical separation of transcription and translation has important implications for the control of gene expression in eukaryotes, which we will consider in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_wGXNb1cdi4">Chapter 17</a>, and it allows for extensive modification of eukaryotic mRNAs, as discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_Q3nj8eraVw">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_zKfq4pPhtQ"><span aria-label="454" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page454" role="doc-pagebreak" title="454"/>Yet another difference is that mRNA in bacterial cells is short-lived, typically lasting only a few minutes, but mRNA in eukaryotic cells can last hours or days. The 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_UwJaVJIoPn">′</sup> cap and 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_EbKemMSNQa">′</sup> poly(A) tail found on eukaryotic mRNAs add to their stability (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Jj2BQS456c" id="ben_9781319297145_80VuGm06jl">Chapter 14</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Muk2KUTNYZ">In both bacterial and eukaryotic cells, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attach amino acids to their appropriate tRNAs, and the chemical process is the same.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_5DV8rYzBDR">There are significant differences in the sizes and compositions of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomal subunits. For example, the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome contains three rRNAs, whereas that of the bacterial ribosome contains only two (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch14_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_w6x9ekj5UD" id="ben_9781319297145_7B1TiuaO38">Table 14.3</a>). These differences allow antibiotics and other substances to inhibit bacterial translation while having no effect on the translation of eukaryotic nuclear genes, as we will see in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ysM7ZwtADX" id="ben_9781319297145_ibF3bKqi42">Section 15.4</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_sEprE5EnDi">Other fundamental differences lie in the process of initiation. In bacterial cells, the small ribosomal subunit attaches directly to the region surrounding the start codon through base pairing between the Shine–Dalgarno sequence in the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_mZ31OK31kQ">′</sup> UTR of the mRNA and a sequence at the 3<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_jEkpguxswh">′</sup> end of the 16S rRNA. In contrast, the small subunit of a eukaryotic ribosome first binds to proteins attached to the 5<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_7R7aZ2LaPM">′</sup> cap on mRNA and then migrates down the mRNA, scanning the sequence until it encounters the first initiation codon. Additionally, a larger number of initiation factors take part in eukaryotic initiation than in bacterial initiation.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_qnLkmSHeO0">Elongation and termination are similar in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, although different elongation and termination factors are used. In both types of organisms, mRNAs are translated multiple times and are simultaneously attached to several ribosomes, forming polyribosomes, as discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch15_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ysM7ZwtADX" id="ben_9781319297145_hZyOjnUzKJ">Section 15.4</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_7LrWL4stBm">Less is known about the process of translation in archaea, but they appear to possess a mixture of bacterial and eukaryotic features. Because archaea lack nuclear membranes, transcription and translation take place simultaneously, just as they do in bacterial cells. Archaea use unformylated methionine as the initiator amino acid, a characteristic of eukaryotic translation. Some of the initiation and release factors in archaea are similar to those found in bacteria, whereas others are similar to those found in eukaryotes. Finally, some of the antibiotics that inhibit translation in bacteria have no effect on translation in archaea, providing further evidence of the fundamental differences between bacteria and archaea.</p>
