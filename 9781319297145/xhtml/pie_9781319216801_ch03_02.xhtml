<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_g1XDaThsnu">It was in the early 1900s that the principles of heredity first became widely known among biologists. Surprisingly, these principles had been discovered some 44 years earlier by an Augustinian priest named Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884) (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_albPpCTFsM"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Y1oVhcqp62" id="ben_9781319297145_eSk4xL2aDP">Figure 3.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_uxkHbsssGb">Mendel was born in what is now part of the Czech Republic. Although his parents were simple farmers with little money, he received a sound education and was admitted to the Augustinian monastery in Brno <span aria-label="49" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" role="doc-pagebreak" title="49"/>in September 1843. After graduating from seminary, Mendel became an ordained priest and was appointed to a teaching position in a local school. He excelled at teaching, and the abbot of the monastery recommended him for further study at the University of Vienna, which he attended from 1851 to 1853. There, Mendel enrolled in the newly opened Physics Institute and took courses in mathematics, chemistry, entomology, paleontology, botany, and plant physiology. It was probably there that Mendel acquired knowledge of the scientific method, which he later applied so successfully to his genetic experiments.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7IoyOO39cZ">After two years of study in Vienna, Mendel returned to Brno, where he taught school and began his experimental work with pea plants. He conducted breeding experiments from 1856 to 1863 and presented his results publicly at meetings of the Brno Natural Science Society in 1865. Mendel’s paper based on these lectures was published in 1866. However, in spite of widespread interest in heredity, the effect of his research on the scientific community was minimal. At the time, no one seemed to have noticed that Mendel had discovered the basic principles of inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_59IcckiLAJ">In 1868, Mendel was elected abbot of his monastery, and increasing administrative duties brought an end to his teaching and, eventually, to his genetic experiments. He died at the age of 61 on January 6, 1884, unrecognized for his contribution to genetics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gxROSOj1oT">The significance of Mendel’s discovery was not recognized until 1900, when three botanists—Hugo de Vries, Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg, and Carl Correns—began independently conducting similar experiments with plants and arrived at conclusions similar to those of Mendel. Coming across Mendel’s paper, they interpreted their results in accord with his principles and drew attention to his pioneering work.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_4CkTV58Agy">Mendel’s approach to the study of heredity was effective for several reasons. Foremost was his choice of experimental subject, the pea plant <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_4SnhQnai0x">Pisum sativum</i> (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_0cwxIXIDNV"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ln06XstKgH" id="ben_9781319297145_ngkYoqIDNR">Figure 3.3</a></strong>), which offered clear advantages for genetic investigation. The plant is easy to cultivate, and Mendel had the monastery garden and greenhouse at his disposal. Compared with some other plants, peas grow relatively rapidly, completing an entire generation in a single growing season. By today’s standards, one generation per year seems frightfully <span aria-label="50" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" role="doc-pagebreak" title="50"/>slow—fruit flies complete a generation in 2 weeks and bacteria in 20 minutes—but Mendel was under no pressure to publish quickly and was able to follow the inheritance of individual characteristics for several generations. Had he chosen to work on an organism with a longer generation time—horses, for example—he might never have discovered the basis of inheritance. Pea plants also produce many offspring—their seeds—which allowed Mendel to detect meaningful mathematical ratios in the traits he observed in the progeny. The numerous varieties of peas that were available to Mendel were also crucial to his success because they differed in various traits and were genetically pure. Mendel was therefore able to begin with plants of variable and known genetic makeup.</p>

In a constricted pod the pod hugs the beans tightly so that it looks bumpy. The last 2 panels on the right show plant characteristics: flower position and stem length. The flowers may be positioned at the terminal tips of the stems or at axial points that occur all along the stem. The flowers in this panel are purple.

He avoided characteristics that display a range of variation; instead, he focused his attention on those that exist in two easily differentiated forms, such as white versus gray seed coats, round versus wrinkled seeds, and inflated versus constricted pods.</p>

This term can refer to any type of characteristic—physical, physiological, biochemical, or behavioral. Thus, the condition of having round seeds is a phenotype, a body weight of 50 kilograms (50 kg) is a phenotype, and having sickle-cell anemia is a phenotype. In this book, the term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Kul1dScr8D">characteristic</i> or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_OICOyGW9qs">character</i> refers to a general feature, such as eye color; the term <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_10Zxh4rlQV">trait</i> or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_05ywuIAj4p">phenotype</i> refers to specific manifestations of that feature, such as blue or brown eyes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Gb76iuTOG3">A given phenotype arises from a genotype that develops within a particular environment. The genotype determines the potential for development; it sets certain limits, or boundaries, on that development. How the phenotype develops within those limits is determined by the effects of other genes and of environmental factors, and the balance between these effects varies from characteristic to characteristic. For some characteristics, differences between phenotypes are determined largely by differences in genotype. In Mendel’s peas, for example, the genotype, not the environment, largely determined the shape of the seeds. For other characteristics, environmental differences are more important. The height reached by an oak tree at maturity is a phenotype that is strongly influenced by environmental factors, such as the availability of water, sunlight, and nutrients. Nevertheless, the tree’s genotype imposes some limits on its height: an oak tree will never grow to be 300 meters (984 feet) tall, no matter how much sunlight, water, and fertilizer are provided. Thus, even the height of an oak tree is determined to some degree by genes. For many characteristics, both genes and environment are important in determining phenotypic differences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_1Zc6Kj5okJ">An obvious but important point is that only the alleles of the genotype are inherited. Although the phenotype is determined, at least to some extent, by the genotype, organisms do not transmit their phenotypes to the next generation. The distinction between genotype and phenotype is one of the most important principles of modern genetics. The next section describes Mendel’s careful observation of phenotypes through several generations of breeding experiments. These experiments allowed him to deduce not only the genotypes of individual pea plants but also the rules governing their inheritance.</p>
