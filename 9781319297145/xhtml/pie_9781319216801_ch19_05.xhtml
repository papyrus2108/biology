<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8cBMuQfP6b">To analyze a gene or to transfer it to another organism, the gene must be located and isolated. Today, most genes are located by sequencing a genome (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch20_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2c5H8e27UU" id="ben_9781319297145_RXIaZngzGs">Chapter 20</a>) and determining the locations of genes from the sequence. Before the development of low-cost sequencing methods, genes were often located by first creating libraries of DNA sequences and then screening those libraries for genes of interest. This approach—to clone first and search later—is called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_5HptLwdgPE">shotgun cloning</i> because it is like hunting with a shotgun: the pellets spray widely in the general direction of the target, with a good chance that one or more of the pellets will hit it. In shotgun cloning, a researcher first clones a large number of DNA fragments, knowing that one or more contains the DNA of interest, and then searches for the fragment of interest among the clones.<span aria-label="587" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page587" role="doc-pagebreak" title="587"/></p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pDw1TK4bC4">A genomic library must contain a large number of clones to ensure that all DNA sequences in the genome are represented in the library. A library of the human genome formed by using cosmids, each carrying a random DNA fragment from 35,000 to 44,000 bp long, would require about 350,000 cosmid clones to provide a 99% chance that every sequence is included in the library.</p>

Much of eukaryotic DNA consists of sequences that are not transcribed into mRNA, and these sequences are not represented in a cDNA library. A cDNA library has two additional advantages. First, it is enriched with fragments from actively transcribed genes. Second, introns do not interrupt the cloned sequences; introns pose a problem when the goal is to produce a eukaryotic protein in bacteria, because most bacteria have no means of removing the introns. The disadvantage of a cDNA library is that it contains only sequences that are present in mature mRNA; therefore, sequences that are not transcribed, such as those in promoters and enhancers, are not present in a cDNA library. Furthermore, a cDNA library contains only those genes expressed in the tissue from which the RNA was isolated, and the frequency of a particular DNA sequence in a cDNA library depends on the abundance of the corresponding mRNA in that tissue. In contrast, almost all genes are present at the same frequency in a genomic library.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TmfybSMhZH">To create a cDNA library, messenger RNA is first extracted from cells and separated from other types of cellular RNA (such as tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA). The mRNA molecules are then copied into cDNA using reverse transcriptase, an enzyme isolated from retroviruses (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_PfSmFMNvzH" id="ben_9781319297145_RyIdEOU1Q4">Section 9.4</a>) that synthesizes single-stranded complementary DNA using RNA as a template.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_MtTTRh4g4u">Once a DNA library is created, it can be screened to find a gene or sequence of interest. The screening procedure used depends on what is known about the gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_vsJe3bwYMt">The first step in screening is to plate the clones of the library. If a plasmid or cosmid vector was used to construct the library, the bacterial cells are diluted and plated so that each bacterium grows into a distinct colony. If a phage vector was used, the phages are allowed to infect a lawn of bacteria on a petri plate. Each resulting plaque or bacterial colony contains a single cloned DNA fragment that must be screened for the gene of interest.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_pCRoN0QVYI">A common way to screen DNA libraries is with probes (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_VaYHgD3fNv"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_dJPZTKc4Gq" id="ben_9781319297145_wj2azzLKXz">Figure 19.13</a></strong>). But how is a probe obtained when the gene of interest has not yet been isolated? One option is to use a similar gene from another organism as the probe. For <span aria-label="588" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page588" role="doc-pagebreak" title="588"/>example, if we wanted to screen a human genomic library for the growth-hormone gene, and a growth-hormone gene had already been isolated from rats, we could use a purified rat-gene sequence as a probe to find the human gene for growth hormone. Successful hybridization does not require perfect complementarity between the probe and the target sequence, so a related sequence can often be used as a probe.</p>

Two captions read as follows: “A few cells from each colony adhere to the nitrocellulose filter.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_d2fLhGtA7J">Alternatively, synthetic probes can be created if the protein produced by the gene of interest has been isolated and its amino acid sequence has been determined. With the use of the genetic code, possible nucleotide sequences of a small region of the gene can be deduced from the amino acid sequence of the protein. Although only one nucleotide sequence in the gene encodes a particular protein, the existence of synonymous codons means that the same protein could be produced by several different sequences, and it is impossible to know which one is correct. To overcome this problem, a mixture of all the possible nucleotide sequences is used as a probe. To minimize the number of sequences required in the mixture, a region of the protein with relatively little degeneracy in its codons is selected. When part of the DNA sequence of the gene has been determined, a set of DNA probes can be synthesized chemically by using an automated machine known as an oligonucleotide synthesizer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MV69w5TflK">Yet another method of screening a DNA library is to look for the protein product of a gene. This method requires that the DNA library be cloned in an expression vector. The clones can be tested for the presence of the protein by using an antibody that recognizes the protein or by using a chemical test for the protein. This method depends on the existence of an antibody or test for the protein produced by the gene of interest. DNA libraries can also be screened using PCR or by sequencing, as mentioned earlier in this chapter.

The name of this technique is derived from the fact that DNA (or RNA) is visualized while it is in the cell (in situ). It requires that the cells be fixed and the chromosomes be spread on a microscope slide and denatured. A labeled probe is then applied to the slide, just as it can be applied to a gel.

This probe is used to screen the genomic library to find a second clone (clone B) that overlaps with the first and extends in the direction of the gene of interest.

In this way, one can systematically “walk” toward the gene of interest, one clone at a time. A related technique, called chromosome jumping, allows one to move from more distantly linked markers to clones that contain a sequence of interest.</p>

A forward arrow on the D N A reads direction of walk. Captions in the illustration are as follows: “A probe complementary to the end of clone A is used to find overlapping clone B. A probe complementary to the end of clone B is used to find overlapping clone C. A probe complementary to the end of clone C is used to find overlapping clone D, containing the gene of interest.” Conclusion states that by making probes complementary to areas of overlap between cloned fragments in a genomic library, we can connect a gene of interest to a previously mapped, linked gene.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qDFMTRDFwY">After clones that cover the delineated chromosome region have been obtained by chromosome walking or jumping, all genes located within the region are identified. Genes can be distinguished from other sequences by the presence of characteristic features, such as consensus sequences in the promoter and a start codon and a stop codon within the same reading frame. After candidate genes have been identified, they can be evaluated to determine which is most likely to be the gene of interest. The expression pattern of the gene—where and when it is transcribed—can often provide clues about its function; for example, genes for neurological disease would probably be expressed in the brain. Geneticists often look in the coding regions of candidate genes for mutations among individuals with the phenotype of interest. The first gene responsible for a human genetic disease that was isolated entirely by positional cloning was the gene for cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_bAfJJ0eHJe">Positional cloning allows researchers to isolate a gene without having knowledge of the biochemical basis of its phenotype. Linkage studies are used to map the locus producing a phenotype of interest to a particular chromosome region. Chromosome walking and jumping can be used to progress from molecular markers to clones containing sequences that cover the chromosome region. Candidate genes within the region are then evaluated to determine whether they encode the phenotype of interest.</p>
