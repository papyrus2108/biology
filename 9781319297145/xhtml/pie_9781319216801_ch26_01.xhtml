<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_r8pQKxsLld">Although other hominins coexisted with modern humans (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_6HJziqrWbc">Homo sapiens</i>) as recently as 40,000 years ago, today we are the only living hominin species. Our closest living relatives are chimpanzees (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_DVBeWgtLUs">Pan troglodytes</i>) and bonobos (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_21QFpTABwa">Pan paniscus</i>), primates that make their home in central Africa. Bonobos were recognized as different from chimpanzees in the early 1900s and were formally described as a distinct species in 1933. Bonobos are smaller and more slender than chimpanzees. They also differ socially: chimpanzees live in male-dominated groups, whereas bonobo groups are female oriented.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kw9U3PcIii">As we will learn in this chapter, species are often defined by the biological species concept, which proposes that a species is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals that are reproductively isolated from other species. Chimpanzees and bonobos will mate in zoos, but these are artificial environments, and it has long been assumed that they do not hybridize in nature. Indeed, a number of studies have established that chimpanzees and bonobos differ in anatomy, behavior, and genetics, supporting their assignment as different species. Research has established that chimps belong to four genetically distinct clusters, described as subspecies. These groups are scattered across western and central Africa (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qqZBsGmgLG" id="ben_9781319297145_NvGjU57Lt4"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_EhrtLFrDKZ">Figure 26.1</strong></a>). In contrast, bonobos are more uniform in their genetic makeup and are found exclusively in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_25rveOeTCz">In 2016, Marc de Manuel and his colleagues undertook the most detailed study ever of genetic differences between chimpanzees and bonobos. They analyzed 75 complete genomes of chimps and bonobos from 10 different African countries. What they found was remarkable and challenges our understanding of the biological species concept. Like previous researchers, they observed extensive genetic differences between chimpanzees and bonobos. And, consistent with prior work, they observed that chimpanzees are genetically diverse and divided into four distinct clusters. What was new and surprising was the discovery—based on the genome sequence data—of extensive ancient gene flow between chimpanzees and bonobos, gene flow that occurred after these two groups had become distinct species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_ySB2cr9eSN">Chimpanzees and bonobos probably diverged from a common ancestor some 2.6 million years ago during the Pleistocene. The analysis by de Manuel and his colleagues suggested that after splitting into two separate species, chimps and bonobos exchanged genes <span aria-label="798" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page798" role="doc-pagebreak" title="798"/>from 550,000 to 100,000 years ago. The period when this mixing took place was a time of extensive climate change, when the bonobo populations were dropping in size and chimpanzee populations were expanding. Further analysis suggests that bonobo genes may have been disadvantageous in the chimpanzee genome and may have been selected against, helping to maintain the genetic distinctions that we see today between the two species. Nevertheless, central and eastern subspecies of chimpanzees today share genetic material with bonobos that is missing from the other, more distant subspecies of chimpanzees.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tyYRJaJkaP">What is most intriguing is that human evolution is marked by similar genetic exchange among species. In its recent past, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_sIMFKkn9MZ">Homo sapiens</i> engaged in mixing with other species of hominins: after becoming a distinct species, modern humans interbred with at least two different species, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Evidence of this mixing is seen in present-day human genomes—some populations of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nTcWzR9m7p">Homo sapiens</i> still carry within their genomes relict genes from these other hominin species (see the introductory story for <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xua4LZ2D44" id="ben_9781319297145_LeMcL3HalD">Chapter 10</a>). Gene flow among closely related species is not confined to primates: examples are found in many other types of organisms as well. As we will learn in this chapter, species are often defined as reproductively isolated groups that do not interbreed with other species. These genetic studies of bonobos, chimpanzees, and hominins challenge this traditional idea of a species as a reproductively isolated group and emphasize one of the limitations of this species definition.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_z7mGgXt7zs">This chapter is about the genetic basis of evolution. Evolutionary genetics has a long history but, as illustrated by the study of chimpanzee and bonobo genomes, has been transformed in recent years by the application of powerful molecular genetic techniques. In <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNqy757pBo" id="ben_9781319297145_CdWSa7ttGd">Chapter 25</a>, we considered the evolutionary forces that bring about change in the allelic frequencies of a population: mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection. In this chapter, we examine <span aria-label="799" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page799" role="doc-pagebreak" title="799"/>some specific ways in which these forces shape the genetic makeup of populations and bring about long-term evolution. We begin by looking at how the process of evolution depends on genetic variation and how genetic variation in natural populations is studied. We then turn to the evolutionary changes that result in the appearance of new species, and we see how evolutionary histories (phylogenies) can be constructed. We end the chapter by taking a look at patterns of evolutionary change at the molecular level.</p>
