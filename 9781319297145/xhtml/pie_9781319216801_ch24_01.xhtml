<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_D65x1nBOz1">In 2019, the world’s population was 7.7 billion. The United Nations projects that by 2050, it will increase by another 2.1 billion. Feeding those billions of additional people will be a major challenge for agriculture in the next few decades. Crop plants will have to provide most of the calories and nutrients required for the world’s future population. Furthermore, because of dwindling petroleum supplies and concerns about global warming, plants are increasingly being used as sources of biofuel, placing additional demands on crop production.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7gaboKFik4">To help meet the need for increased crop yields, plant breeders are using the latest genetic techniques in their quest to develop higher-yielding, more efficient crop plants. The power of this approach is demonstrated by research aimed at increasing the oil content of corn. The oil content of corn is an inherited characteristic, but its inheritance is more complex than that of the characteristics we have studied so far; it is not a simple single-gene characteristic, like seed shape in peas. Numerous genes and environmental factors contribute to the oil content of corn. For characteristics such as oil content, several loci frequently interact, and their expression is affected by environmental factors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2Y1y3AqFYx">Can the inheritance of a complex characteristic such as oil content be studied? Is it possible to predict the oil content of a plant on the basis of its breeding? The answer to both questions is yes—at least in part—but these questions cannot be addressed with the methods we have used for simple genetic characteristics. Instead, we must use statistical procedures that have been developed for analyzing complex characteristics. The genetic analysis of complex characteristics, such as the oil content of corn, is known as

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VME3CeF730">In 2008, geneticists used a combination of quantitative genetic and molecular techniques to identify a gene that plays a key role in controlling the oil content of corn. First, they conducted crosses between high-oil and low-oil corn plants to identify chromosomal regions that play a role in determining oil production. Chromosomal regions containing genes that influence a quantitative trait are termed quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Through these crosses, the geneticists located several QTLs that affected oil content; one of them was on corn chromosome 6.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_wwpB2HZH75">Fine-scale gene mapping further narrowed the QTL down to a small region of 4.2 map units (centiMorgans) on chromosome 6. Researchers sequenced DNA from the region and found that it contained five genes, one of which was <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PloSStbmdy">DGAT1-2</i>, a gene known to encode an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in a pathway for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. <span aria-label="732" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page732" role="doc-pagebreak" title="732"/>DNA from the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tS1IbmVm1Z">DGAT1-2</i> gene in a high-oil-producing strain of corn contained an insertion of a codon that added phenylalanine to the enzyme—an insertion that was missing from a low-oil-producing strain. The researchers confirmed the effect of the additional phenylalanine codon on oil production by producing transgenic corn that contained the extra codon. These transgenic strains produced more oil than transgenic strains without the additional codon. Interestingly, the additional phenylalanine codon is present in wild relatives of corn, suggesting that the codon was lost in the process of domestication or subsequent breeding of modern varieties.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OYq35PjlLN">This research suggests that the oil content of corn and other plants might be increased by genetically modifying their <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_FAAIBaXlLI">DGAT1-2</i> genes to contain the additional codon for phenylalanine. Other studies that similarly combine quantitative and molecular analyses have led to the identification of genes that increase the vitamin A content of rice and increase sugar production in tomatoes.</p>

Would you consider this variety to be a genetically modified organism (GMO; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_MwAjWR9z6V" id="ben_9781319297145_V9YvRI4Gy0">Chapter 19</a>)?

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_802vVVb3VG">This chapter is about the genetic analysis of complex characteristics, such as the oil content of corn. We begin by considering the differences between quantitative and qualitative genetic characteristics and why the expression of some characteristics varies continuously. We’ll see that quantitative characteristics are often influenced by many genes, each of which has a small effect on the phenotype. Next, we’ll examine statistical procedures for describing and analyzing quantitative characteristics. We’ll consider how much of phenotypic variation can be attributed to genetic and environmental influences. Finally, we’ll look at the effects of selection on quantitative characteristics.</p>
