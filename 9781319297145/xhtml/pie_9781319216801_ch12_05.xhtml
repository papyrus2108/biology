<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_9CeP6jQNxx">Although eukaryotic replication resembles bacterial replication in many respects, replication in eukaryotic cells presents several additional challenges. First, the much greater size of eukaryotic genomes requires that replication be initiated at multiple origins. Second, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, whereas prokaryotic chromosomes are circular. Third, the DNA template is associated with histone proteins in the form of nucleosomes, and nucleosome assembly must immediately follow DNA replication.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Y5r0yex8Gs">Researchers first isolated eukaryotic origins of replication from yeast cells by demonstrating that certain DNA sequences confer the ability to replicate when transferred from a yeast chromosome to small circular pieces of DNA (plasmids). These

They were subsequently shown to be the origins of replication in yeast chromosomes. The nature of origins of replication in many multicellular eukaryotes are still poorly understood. Origins in different eukaryotic organisms vary greatly in sequence, although they usually contain a number of A–T base pairs. Evidence suggests that eukaryotic origins are often defined more by modifications to chromatin structure (epigenetic modifications, see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch21_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_Hmwj9TbBxX">Chapter 21</a>) than by specific sequences.

In multicellular eukaryotes, there are often many more potential replication origins than are actually used during DNA synthesis. Whether the sites that are used are determined at random or are somehow specified is not known.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_z5IClKbzSJ">Another difference in replication of eukaryotes involves the role of the initiator. In bacteria, helicase is unable to bind to double-stranded DNA; initiator protein first melts DNA, creating a single-stranded template that helicase then binds to. In eukaryotes, however, the initiator ORC recruits and loads helicase onto double-stranded DNA at the origin. This takes place during G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_48mpbksoKn">1</sub> of the cell cycle. Then during S phase, helicase becomes activated and begins separating double-stranded DNA into single-stranded templates that are used in DNA synthesis.</p>

In the second step, the replication machinery initiates replication at each licensed origin. The key is that the replication machinery functions only at licensed origins and that licensing occurs early in the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_IMNvniLYJ2">Licensing occurs in G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_21KxoCDPbw">1</sub> of interphase when the origin-recognition complex binds to an origin. ORC, with the help of two additional licensing factors, allows a complex called MCM2-7 (for minichromosome maintenance) to bind to an origin. Then, in S phase, the MCM2-7 complex associates with several cofactors and forms an active helicase that unwinds double-stranded DNA for replication. After replication has begun, several mechanisms prevent MCM2-7 from binding to DNA and reinitiating replication at the origins until after mitosis has been completed.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Wse8De0TnE">Helicases that separate double-stranded DNA have been isolated from eukaryotic cells, as have single-strand-binding proteins and topoisomerases (which have a function equivalent to the DNA gyrase in bacterial cells). These enzymes and proteins are assumed to function in unwinding eukaryotic DNA in much the same way as their bacterial counterparts do.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_tfS1hcwi17">Topoisomerase enzymes are also required to remove supercoiling that builds up ahead of the replication fork in eukaryotes, just as DNA gyrase does in bacteria. Topoisomerase enzymes remove the supercoils by clamping tightly to the DNA and breaking one or both of its strands. The strands then revolve around each other, removing the supercoiling and the strain. After the DNA has relaxed, the topoisomerase reseals the broken ends of the DNA strands. Some anticancer drugs work by interfering with these topoisomerases. Camptothecin compounds, isolated from the happy tree <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nxAbsBEXfT">Camptotheca acuminate</i>, insert themselves into the DNA gap created by topoisomerase I and block the topoisomerase from resealing the broken ends of DNA. This poisons the topoisomerase so that it is unable to remove supercoils ahead of replication. Accumulating supercoils halts the replication machinery and prevents the proliferation of cancer cells. But like many other anticancer drugs, camptothecin also inhibits the replication of normal, <span aria-label="361" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page361" role="doc-pagebreak" title="361"/>noncancerous cells, which is why chemotherapy makes many patients sick.</p>

Thus, these specialized enzymes can bypass such errors, but because their active sites are more open and accommodating, they tend to make more errors. In replication, high-speed, high-fidelity enzymes are generally used until they encounter a replication block. At that point, one or more of the translesion DNA polymerases takes over, bypasses the lesion, and continues replicating a short section of DNA. Then the translesion polymerases detach from the replication fork, and high-fidelity polymerases resume replication with high speed and accuracy. DNA-repair enzymes often repair the errors produced by the translesion polymerases, although some of these errors may escape detection and lead to mutations.</p>

Before replication, a single DNA molecule is associated with histone proteins. After replication and nucleosome assembly, two DNA molecules are associated with histone proteins.

A part of this cell growth is saved and the remaining is transferred to a medium that contains amino acids labeled with a light isotope. 2, A caption referring to a flask of lighter liquid reads, transfer the cells to a medium that contains amino acids labeled with a light isotope.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_1mfoTltUzq">After replication, when the histone octamers were isolated and centrifuged in a density gradient, they formed a continuous band between the positions expected of high-density (old) and low-density (new) octamers. This finding indicates that newly assembled octamers consist of a mixture of old and new histones. Further evidence indicates that reconstituted nucleosomes appear on the new DNA molecules quickly after the new DNA emerges from the replication machinery.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_d5wqluTli3">The reassembly of nucleosomes during replication is facilitated by proteins called histone chaperones, which are associated with the helicase enzyme that unwinds the DNA. The histone chaperones accept old histones from the original DNA molecule and deposit them, along with newly synthesized histones, on the two new DNA molecules. Current evidence suggests that the original histone octamer is broken down into two H2A–H2B dimers (each dimer consisting of one H2A and one H2B) and a single H3–H4 tetramer (each tetramer consisting of two H3 histones and two H4 histones). The old H3–H4 tetramer is then transferred randomly to one of the new DNA molecules and serves as a foundation onto which either new or old copies of H2A–H2B dimers are added. Newly synthesized H3–H4 tetramers and H2A–H2B dimers are also added to each new DNA molecule to complete the formation of new nucleosomes. The assembly of the new nucleosomes is facilitated by a protein called chromatin-assembly factor 1 (CAF-1). <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_sdXOAfypW4">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_7kxpN9UDko" id="ben_9781319297145_G7iPbVxnPv">PROBLEM 31</a></strong></p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2N0P2ItNGK">The end-replication problem, as originally proposed, assumed that the terminal primer is located at the very end of the chromosome. Experimental evidence suggests that in some single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast and some protozoans, the terminal primer is indeed placed at the very end of the chromosome, but this has not been demonstrated for more complex multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, chromosome ends in humans are known to shorten at a much faster rate than would be expected if only the terminal primer (which is only about 10 nucleotides long) was not replaced. Research has now demonstrated that in replication of human chromosomes, the terminal primer is positioned not at the end of the chromosome but rather some 70 to 100 nucleotides from the end (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_aDhNTMgM5E" id="ben_9781319297145_CDij8C9apT">Figure 12.17b</a>).

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Wsho0Uq5Qy">Telomerase is present in single-celled eukaryotes, germ cells, early embryonic cells, and certain proliferative somatic cells (such as bone-marrow cells and cells lining the intestine), all of which must undergo continuous cell division. Most somatic cells have little or no telomerase activity, and chromosomes in these cells progressively shorten with each cell division. These cells are capable of only a limited number of divisions; when the telomeres have shortened beyond a critical point, the chromosomes become unstable, have a tendency to undergo rearrangements, and are degraded. These events lead to cell death.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_kuqYywvBKn">The shortening of telomeres may contribute to the process of aging. The telomeres of genetically engineered mice that lack a functional telomerase gene (and therefore do not express telomerase in either somatic or germ cells) undergo progressive shortening in successive generations. After several generations, these mice show some signs of premature aging, such as graying, hair loss, and delayed wound healing. Through genetic engineering, it is also possible to create somatic cells that express telomerase. In these cells, telomeres do not shorten, cell aging is inhibited, and the cells divide indefinitely.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_75d0XQR5Aw">Some of the strongest evidence that telomere length is related to aging comes from studies of telomeres in birds. In 2012, scientists in the United Kingdom measured telomere length in red blood cells taken from 99 zebra finches at various times during their lives. The scientists found a strong correlation between telomere length and longevity: birds with longer telomeres lived longer than birds with short telomeres. The strongest predictor of life span was telomere length early in life, at 25 days, which is roughly equivalent to human adolescence. Although these observations suggest that telomere length is associated with aging in some animals, the precise role of telomeres in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_tBwNSQe25r">human</i> aging remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OepVhMaeAG">Some diseases are associated with abnormalities of telomere replication. People who have Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease, show signs of premature aging that begin in adolescence or early adulthood, including wrinkled skin, graying of the hair, baldness, cataracts, and muscle atrophy. They often develop cancer, osteoporosis, heart and artery disease, and other ailments typically associated with aging. The causative gene, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_6kzsu8uUB1">WRN</i>, has been mapped to human chromosome 8 and normally encodes a RecQ helicase enzyme, which is necessary for the efficient replication of telomeres. In people who have Werner syndrome, this enzyme is defective; consequently, the telomeres shorten prematurely.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RuAQKixdGh">Another disease associated with abnormal maintenance of telomeres is dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), which leads to progressive bone-marrow failure, in which the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells. People with an X-linked form of the disease have a mutation in a gene that encodes dyskerin, a protein that normally helps process the RNA component of telomerase. People who have the disease typically inherit short telomeres from a parent who carries the mutation and who is unable to maintain telomere length in his or her germ cells owing to defective dyskerin. In families that carry this mutation, telomere length typically shortens with each successive generation, leading to anticipation: a progressive increase in the severity of the disease over generations (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNTj8vXJKP" id="ben_9781319297145_R36T9tgRjK">Section 5.4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gc5u0JCESj">Telomerase also appears to play a role in cancer. Cancer cells have the capacity to divide indefinitely, and telomerase is expressed in 90% of all cancers. Some recent evidence indicates that telomerase may stimulate cell proliferation independently of its effect on telomere length, so the mechanism by which telomerase contributes to cancer is not clear. As we will see in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch23_01.xhtml" id="ben_9781319297145_WU0E9Td8Ly">Chapter 23</a>, cancer is a complex, multistep process that usually requires mutations in at least several genes. Telomerase activation alone does not lead to cancerous growth in most cells, but it does appear to be required, along with other mutations, for cancer to develop. Some experimental anticancer drugs work by inhibiting the action of telomerase.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Ox7SoCNgTA">One of the difficulties in studying the effect of telomere shortening on the aging process is that the expression of telomerase in somatic cells also promotes cancer, which may shorten a person’s life span. To circumvent this problem, Antonia Tomás-Loba and her colleagues created genetically engineered mice that expressed telomerase and carried genes that made them resistant to cancer. These mice had <span aria-label="366" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page366" role="doc-pagebreak" title="366"/>longer telomeres, lived longer, and exhibited fewer age-related changes, such as skin alterations, decreases in neuromuscular coordination, and degenerative diseases, than did normal mice. These results support the idea that telomere shortening contributes to aging. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_scbqkfZFqA">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_fdrKXkO9hc" id="ben_9781319297145_gtUXVxC2jP">PROBLEM 33</a></strong></p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_MadWc6cGiC">The process of replication in archaea has a number of features in common with replication in eukaryotic cells. Many of the proteins taking part are more similar to those in eukaryotic cells than to those in bacteria. Like bacteria, some archaea have a single origin of replication, but many archaea have multiple origins, as eukaryotes do (although archaea have far fewer origins than are found in most eukaryotic chromosomes). The origins of archaea do not contain the typical sequences recognized by bacterial initiator proteins; instead, they have sequences that are similar to those found in some eukaryotic origins. The initiator proteins of archaea are also more similar to those of eukaryotes than to those of bacteria. These similarities in replication between archaeal and eukaryotic cells reinforce the conclusion that the archaea are more closely related to eukaryotic cells than to the prokaryotic bacteria.</p>
