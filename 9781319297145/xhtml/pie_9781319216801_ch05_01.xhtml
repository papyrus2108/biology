<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aU7UEM9Es3">At the start of the twentieth century, Mendel’s work on inheritance in pea plants became widely known (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_lgF7rF7G1D" id="ben_9781319297145_vNDYEBi99r">Chapter 3</a>), and a number of biologists set out to verify his conclusions by conducting crosses with other organisms. Biologists quickly confirmed that Mendel’s principles applied not just to peas but also to corn, beans, chickens, mice, guinea pigs, humans, and many other organisms. At the same time, biologists began to discover exceptions—traits whose inheritance was more complex than that of the simple dominant and recessive traits that Mendel had observed. One of these exceptions was the spiral of a snail’s shell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LR9yhPbmSD">The direction of coiling in snail shells is called chirality. Most snail shells spiral downward in a clockwise or right-handed direction. These shells are said to be dextral. A few snails have shells that coil in the opposite direction, spiraling downward in a counterclockwise or left-handed direction. These shells are said to be sinistral. Most snail species have shells that are all dextral or all sinistral; only in a few rare instances do both dextral and sinistral shells coexist in the same species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_d0B7AILVJn">In the 1920s and 1930s, Arthur Boycott, of the University of London, investigated the genetics of shell coiling in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_811IW6P7vB">Lymnaea peregra</i>, a common pond snail in Britain. In this species, most snails are dextral, but a few sinistral snails occur in some populations. Boycott learned from amateur naturalists of a pond near Leeds, England, where an abnormally high number of sinistral snails could be found. He obtained four sinistral snails from this location and began to investigate the genetics of shell chirality.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VOrbcTl9cp">Boycott’s research was complicated by the fact that these snails are hermaphroditic, meaning that a snail can self-fertilize, or <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_amlpp5M5Yw">self</i> (mate with itself). If a suitable partner is available, the snails are also capable of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_pWZmTkq1cL">outcrossing</i>—mating with another individual. Boycott found that if he isolated a newly hatched snail and reared it alone, it would eventually produce offspring, so he knew that it had selfed. But when he placed two snails together and one produced offspring, he had no way of knowing whether it had mated with itself or with the other snail. Boycott’s research required rearing large numbers of snails in isolation and in pairs, raising their offspring, and determining the direction of shell coiling for each offspring. To facilitate the work, he enlisted the aid of several amateur scientists. One of his helpers was Captain C. Diver, a friend who worked as <span aria-label="112" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page112" role="doc-pagebreak" title="112"/>an assistant for the British Parliament. Since Parliament met for only part of the year, Diver had time on his hands and eagerly enlisted to assist with the research. Together, Boycott, Diver, and other assistants carried out numerous breeding experiments, selfing and crossing snails and raising the progeny in jam jars. They eventually raised more than 6000 broods and determined the direction of coiling in a million snails.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_zEqQiZ80vh">Initially, their results were puzzling—shell coiling did not appear to conform to Mendel’s principles of heredity. Eventually, they realized that dextral was dominant to sinistral but with a peculiar twist: the phenotype of a snail was determined <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_WciUMlfbSr">not</i> by its own genotype but by the genotype of its mother. This phenomenon—determination of the phenotype by the genotype of the mother—is called genetic maternal effect. Genetic maternal effect often arises because the maternal parent produces a substance, encoded by her own genotype, that is deposited in the cytoplasm of the egg and that influences early development of the offspring.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TkIzMypERs">In 2016, several researchers found that direction of coiling in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2Tw1q6w5H0">Lymnaea</i> snails is determined by the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wmah9MdEa7">Lsdia1</i> gene, which plays a role in cytoskeleton formation. Sinistral snails possess a mutation in their <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_EOIlrPvrEj">Lsdia1</i> alleles that prevents a functional protein from being produced. How the absence of this protein switches the direction of shell coiling is not yet clear.</p>

<li id="ben_9781319297145_G41EYpzYOz">The introduction to this chapter discusses the genetic basis of chirality in snails and the research of Arthur Boycott, whose work established the mode of inheritance for this trait. In the course of his research, Boycott enlisted the aid of several amateur scientists—individuals who were not trained as scientists and had other jobs. The research would have been impossible without the aid of these people. In the past, amateur scientists such as these often made important contributions to science, but the practice is less frequent today. Discuss some possible reasons for the decline in contributions to research by amateur scientists. Are there any areas where amateur scientists still actively contribute?</li>
<li id="ben_9781319297145_r5itGjjHC2">Genetic maternal effect is often seen in mammals. For example, research shows that the maternal genotype influences adult body size in mice. Why might these types of genetic effects be more common in mammals than in other organisms, such as fishes, amphibians, or reptiles?</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sbyt3zJaBu">Boycott’s research on the direction of coiling in snails demonstrated that not all characteristics are inherited as simple dominant and recessive traits, like the shapes and colors of peas that Mendel described. This demonstration doesn’t mean that Mendel was wrong; rather, it indicates that Mendel’s principles are not, by themselves, sufficient to explain the inheritance of all genetic characteristics. Our modern understanding of genetics has been greatly enriched by the discovery of a number of modifications and extensions of Mendel’s basic principles, which are the focus of this chapter.</p>
