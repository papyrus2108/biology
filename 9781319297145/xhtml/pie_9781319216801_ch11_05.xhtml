<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_WPTvYOc5HP">As we have seen, eukaryotic chromosomes reside within the nucleus and have a complex structure consisting of DNA and associated histone proteins. However, some DNA found in eukaryotic cells occurs outside the nucleus, has a very different organization, and exhibits a different pattern of inheritance from nuclear DNA. This DNA occurs in mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are membrane-bounded organelles located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_AVq8ZEcOWO" id="ben_9781319297145_em9acFN898"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_gLecoP9WeU">Figure 11.11</strong></a>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_W1YeeOnjol">Mitochondria are tubular structures that are from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer (µm) in diameter, about the size of a typical bacterium, whereas chloroplasts are typically from about 4 to 6 µm in diameter. Both are surrounded by two membranes enclosing a region (called the matrix in mitochondria and the stroma in chloroplasts) that contains enzymes, ribosomes, RNA, and DNA. In mitochondria, the inner membrane is highly folded; embedded within it are the enzymes that catalyze electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Chloroplasts have a thylakoid membrane, which is highly folded and stacked to form aggregates called grana. This membrane bears the pigments and enzymes required for photophosphorylation. New mitochondria and <span aria-label="329" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page329" role="doc-pagebreak" title="329"/>chloroplasts arise by the division of existing organelles; these divisions take place throughout the cell cycle and are independent of mitosis and meiosis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Bfrd26xluG">Mitochondria and chloroplasts possess DNA that encodes some polypeptides used by the organelles, as well as rRNAs found in the ribosomes and the tRNAs needed for the translation of these proteins. The genes for most of the 900 or so structural proteins and enzymes found in mitochondria, however, are actually encoded by nuclear DNA; the mitochondrial genome typically encodes only a few proteins and a few rRNA and tRNA molecules needed for mitochondrial protein synthesis.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_2h5TZf6Pkj">A great deal of evidence supports the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as bacterial cells. Many modern single-celled eukaryotes (protists) are hosts to endosymbiotic bacteria. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar in size to present-day bacteria and possess their own DNA, which shares many characteristics with bacterial DNA. Mitochondria and chloroplasts possess <span aria-label="330" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" role="doc-pagebreak" title="330"/>ribosomes, some of which are similar in size and structure to bacterial ribosomes.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qex8YjVBqO">The strongest evidence for the endosymbiotic theory comes from studies of DNA sequences, which demonstrate that sequences in mtDNA and cpDNA are more closely related to sequences in the genes of bacteria than they are to those found in the eukaryotic nucleus. All of this evidence indicates that mitochondria and chloroplasts are more closely related to bacterial cells than they are to the eukaryotic cells in which they are now found.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_3XIKbVEKke">Mitochondria and chloroplasts are present in the cytoplasm and are usually inherited from a single parent. Thus, traits encoded by mtDNA and cpDNA exhibit uniparental inheritance (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_u5G90KQrk0" id="ben_9781319297145_RMxg5WXPEi">Chapter 5</a>). In animals, mtDNA is inherited almost exclusively from the female parent, although occasional male transmission of mtDNA has been documented. In 2018, researchers demonstrated that paternal transmission of mtDNA also occasionally occurs in humans, although it appears to be very rare. Maternal inheritance of animal mtDNA may be partly a function of gamete size: sperm are much smaller than eggs and hold fewer mitochondria. However, in many animals, paternal mitochondria are selectively eliminated by autophagy, a process in which mitochondria are digested by the cell. In these cases, paternal mitochondria are marked for destruction, whereas maternal mitochondria are not; the mechanism that produces this difference is not known. Paternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA is common in gymnosperms (conifers) and in a few angiosperms (flowering plants). Some plants even exhibit biparental inheritance of mtDNA and cpDNA.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_slmN19J7YI">A number of genetic diseases that result from mutations in mtDNA (in addition to MERRF syndrome, mentioned earlier) have been identified in humans. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) results from mutations in the mtDNA genes that encode electron-transport proteins. LHON typically leads to sudden loss of vision in middle age. Another disease caused by mtDNA mutations is neurogenic <span aria-label="332" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page332" role="doc-pagebreak" title="332"/>muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), which is characterized by seizures, dementia, and developmental delay. Other mitochondrial diseases include Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS) and chronic external ophthalmoplegia (CEOP), both of which result in paralysis of the eye muscles; droopy eyelids; and, in severe cases, vision loss, deafness, and dementia. All of these diseases exhibit cytoplasmic inheritance and variable expression (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1Cr0Us1Qbh" id="ben_9781319297145_fY319FJgbF">Chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_h0iKX8Wphu">The conclusion that the disorder is caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial genome is supported by the pedigree and by the observation of variable expression in affected members of the same family. The disorder is passed only from affected mothers to both their male and their female offspring; when fathers are affected, none of their children have the trait (as seen in the children of II-2 and III-6). This outcome is expected of traits determined by mutations in mtDNA because mitochondria are located in the cytoplasm and are usually inherited from a single parent (in humans, the mother). The trait cannot be X-linked recessive because in that case, a cross between a female with the trait (X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_7w9eVDWWLX"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_3ZYPufS4rK">a</i></sup>X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_qC21TmaUKT"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vJO9IFZV3m">a</i></sup>) and a male without the trait (X + Y) would <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0BYgfRC2Qi">not</i> produce daughters with the trait (X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_Psx7D53HV8"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2BMr1ULpHo">a</i></sup>X<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_PwAFjpemlB"><i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kIE1ECMh5d">a</i></sup>) which we see in II-4, III-10, IV-3, and IV-4. It cannot be X-linked dominant, because in that case, II-2 and III-6 would have passed it to their daughters, who are unaffected (unless the trait exhibited incomplete penetrance).</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_bRAuTYo6OV">The facts that some offspring of affected mothers do not show the trait (III-9 and IV-5) and that expression varies from one person to another suggest that the affected family members are heteroplasmic, with both mutant and wild-type mitochondria. Replicative segregation of mitochondria in meiosis may produce gametes having different proportions of mutant and wild-type mtDNA sequences, resulting <span aria-label="333" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" role="doc-pagebreak" title="333"/>in different degrees of phenotypic expression of the disorder among the offspring. Most likely, symptoms of the disorder develop when some minimum proportion of the mitochondria are mutant. Just by chance, some of the gametes produced by an affected mother contain few mutant mitochondria and result in offspring who lack the disorder.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FMV12TrsnO">Another possible explanation for the disorder is that it results from an autosomal dominant allele. When an affected (heterozygous) person mates with an unaffected (homozygous) person, about half of the offspring are expected to have the trait, but just by chance, some affected parents will have no affected offspring. Affected individuals II-2 and III-6 in the pedigree could have just happened to be male, and their sex could be unrelated to the mode of transmission. The variable expression could be explained by variable expressivity (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_02.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_a6Z13hDTlQ" id="ben_9781319297145_qgWToUxknZ">Chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_mzUq1GTgaZ">In most animals and fungi, the entire mitochondrial genome exists on a single double-stranded, highly coiled, circular DNA molecule, although there may be many copies of this genome in each cell. This circular mitochondrial DNA molecule is similar in structure to a bacterial chromosome. Plant mitochondrial genomes often exist as a complex collection of multiple circular DNA molecules. In some species, the mitochondrial genome consists of a single linear DNA molecule.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_AqLw0HkUaR">Each mitochondrion contains multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome, and a cell may contain many mitochondria. A typical rat liver cell, for example, has from 5 to 10 mtDNA molecules in each of about 1000 mitochondria, so each cell possesses from 5000 to 10,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial DNA constitutes about 1% of the total cellular DNA in a rat liver cell. Like bacterial chromosomes, mtDNA lacks the histone proteins normally associated with eukaryotic nuclear DNA, although it is complexed with other proteins that have some histone-like properties. The guanine–cytosine (G–C) content of mtDNA is often sufficiently different from that of nuclear DNA that mtDNA can be separated from nuclear DNA by density-gradient centrifugation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VYkCadwOep">Mitochondrial genomes are small compared with nuclear genomes and vary greatly in size among different organisms. The sizes of mitochondrial genomes of most species range from 15,000 bp to 65,000 bp, but those of a few species are much smaller (e.g., the genome of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_aKyd5EuKVm">Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the parasite that causes malaria, is only 6000 bp), while those of some plants are several million base pairs. There is no correlation, however, between genome size and number of genes. The number of genes is more constant than genome size: most species have only 40 to 50 genes. These genes encode five basic functions: respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, translation, transcription, RNA processing, and the import of proteins into mitochondria. Most of the variation in the size of mitochondrial genomes is due to differences in noncoding DNA sequences. As mentioned earlier, genes for most of the proteins and enzymes found in mitochondria are actually encoded by nuclear DNA.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ucC8AE2Wig">Flowering plants (angiosperms) have the largest and most complex mitochondrial genomes known: their mitochondrial genomes range in size from 186,000 bp in white mustard to 2,400,000 bp in muskmelon. Even closely related plant species may differ greatly in the sizes of their mtDNA. Part of the extensive size variation in the mtDNA of flowering plants can be explained by the presence of long sequences that are direct repeats. Crossing over between these repeats can generate multiple circular chromosomes of different sizes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_JYdKdccjU9">The mitochondrial genome consists of circular DNA with no associated histone proteins, although it is complexed with other proteins that have some histone-like properties. The sizes and structures of mtDNA differ greatly among organisms. Human mtDNA exhibits extreme economy, but mtDNAs found in yeast and flowering plants contain many noncoding nucleotides and repetitive sequences. In most flowering plants, mitochondrial DNA is large and typically has one or more large direct repeats that can recombine to generate smaller or larger molecules.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_bEyM7OQGun">As already mentioned, comparisons of mitochondrial DNA sequences with DNA sequences in bacteria strongly support a common bacterial origin for all mtDNA. Nevertheless, patterns of evolution seen in mtDNA vary greatly among different groups of organisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_E8nzOznFAw">The sequences of vertebrate mtDNA exhibit an accelerated rate of evolution: the sequences in mammalian mtDNA, for example, typically change from 5 to 10 times faster than those in mammalian nuclear DNA. The accelerated rate of evolution seen in vertebrate mtDNA is due to its high mutation rate, which allows sequences to change more quickly. In spite of this high rate of sequence evolution, the numbers of genes present and the organization of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the sequences of plant mtDNA evolve slowly, at a rate only one-tenth that of the nuclear genome, but their gene content and organization change rapidly. The reason for these basic differences in rates of evolution is not yet known.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_z62ehcYvX3">Mitochondrial DNA has been studied extensively to reconstruct patterns of evolution in humans and many other organisms. Some of the advantages of mtDNA for studying evolution include (1) the small size of mtDNA and its abundance in the cell; (2) the rapid evolution of mtDNA sequences in some organisms, which facilitates study of closely related groups; and (3) the maternal inheritance of mtDNA and lack of recombination, which makes it possible to trace female lines of descent. Samples of human mtDNA from thousands of people belonging to hundreds of different ethnic groups throughout the world have been analyzed. These mtDNA samples are helping unravel many aspects of human evolution and history. For example, initial studies on mtDNA sequences led to the proposal that small groups of humans migrated out of Africa about 85,000 years ago and populated the rest of the world. This proposal, called the Out of Africa hypothesis or the African replacement hypothesis, has now gained wide acceptance. The Out of Africa hypothesis is supported by additional studies of DNA sequences from the Y chromosome and nuclear genes. The use of mtDNA in evolutionary studies will be described in more detail in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_s3h1t5cMB6" id="ben_9781319297145_sSk1LLLXAv">Chapter 26</a>.</p>

Because of the large number of mtDNA molecules in each cell and the high rate of mutation in mtDNA, most cells would be expected to contain a mixture of wild-type and mutant mtDNA molecules (heteroplasmy). However, heteroplasmy is rarely present: the copies of mtDNA in most individuals are genetically identical (homoplasmy). To account for the uniformity of mtDNA within individual mammals, geneticists hypothesize that at some point in early development or gamete formation, mtDNA goes through some type of bottleneck, during which the mtDNAs within a cell are reduced to just a few copies, which then replicate and give rise to all subsequent copies of mtDNA. Through this process, genetic variation in mtDNA within a cell is eliminated.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_vHxjUozRT6">The symptoms of many human genetic diseases caused by defects in mtDNA first appear in middle age or later and increase in severity as people age. One hypothesis to explain this pattern is related to the decline in oxidative phosphorylation with aging.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Sk1QSJAz1r">Oxidative phosphorylation is the process that generates ATP, the primary carrier of energy in the cell. This process takes place on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and requires a number of different proteins, some encoded by mtDNA and others encoded by nuclear genes. Oxidative phosphorylation normally declines with age, and if it falls below a critical threshold, tissues do not make enough ATP to sustain vital functions and disease symptoms appear. Most people start life with an excess capacity for oxidative phosphorylation; this capacity decreases with age, but most people reach old age or die before the critical threshold is passed. People who are born with mitochondrial diseases carry mutations in their mtDNA that lower their capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. At birth, their capacity may be sufficient to support their ATP needs, but as their oxidative phosphorylation capacity declines with age, they cross the critical threshold and begin to experience disease symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TDpGKmjzkP">The mechanism of age-related increases in mtDNA damage is not yet known. Oxygen radicals—highly reactive compounds that are natural by-products of oxidative phosphorylation—are known to damage DNA (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch18_03.xhtml#page541" id="ben_9781319297145_laa7nz8qGx">p. 541 in Chapter 18</a>). Because mtDNA is physically close to the enzymes taking part in oxidative phosphorylation, mtDNA may be more prone to oxidative damage than is nuclear DNA. When mtDNA has been damaged, the cell’s capacity to produce ATP drops.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_WekrswSH7R">One type of MRT, termed pronuclear transfer, starts with an egg from a woman with an mtDNA mutation. The egg is fertilized in vitro (in the laboratory). After penetrating the egg, the sperm releases its nucleus into the egg, resulting in two nuclei (called pronuclei), one from the father and one from the mother. Using a very fine pipette, a technician removes the pronuclei and transfers them to an egg cell from a healthy donor from which the nucleus has been previously removed. Inside the donor egg, the pronuclei fuse, and the resulting embryo begins development. The developing embryo is then implanted into the uterus of the affected female.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_syevTaKPxM">In a related technique, called maternal spindle transfer, the nuclear material is removed from the unfertilized oocyte of an affected female and transferred to an enucleated donor egg. The resulting oocyte, containing nuclear genetic material from the affected mother and cytoplasm from the healthy donor, is fertilized in vitro. The resulting embryo is then implanted into the affected female.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_iuC7cutVbj">Mitochondrial replacement therapy is legally permissible for preventing mitochondrial disorders in the United Kingdom and a few other countries, but its use is not currently allowed in the United States. Because it combines genetic material from three parents in the conception of a child, MRT has raised a number of ethical and safety issues. Some mutated mitochondrial DNAs may be carried over when the nuclear material is transferred to a healthy egg; although this is usually a very small fraction of all the mtDNA in the cell, the long-term consequences are unknown. There have also been concerns about the possible developmental consequences of combining nuclear DNA and mtDNA from different people.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_PJjUG6qKxY">Among plants, the chloroplast genome ranges in size from 80,000 to 600,000 bp, but most chloroplast genomes range from 120,000 to 160,000 bp. Chloroplast DNA is usually a single double-stranded DNA molecule that is circular, highly coiled, and lacks associated histone proteins. As in mtDNA, multiple copies of the chloroplast genome are found in each chloroplast, and there are multiple organelles per cell, so there are several hundred to several thousand copies of cpDNA in a typical plant cell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_qTHokU51ga">The chloroplast genomes of a number of plant and algal species have been sequenced, and cpDNA is now recognized to be basically bacterial in its organization: the order of some groups of genes is the same as that observed in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2SJQ93oauK">E. coli</i>, and many chloroplast genes are organized into clusters similar to those found in bacteria.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_am1s9pmYTa">Among vascular plants, chloroplast genomes are similar in gene content and gene order. A typical chloroplast genome encodes 4 rRNA genes, from 30 to 35 tRNA genes, a number of ribosomal proteins, many proteins engaged in photosynthesis, and several proteins with roles in nonphotosynthetic processes (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_hPQnoDrOPu" id="ben_9781319297145_3MwuWBQtlG"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Kq7BLxz2kd">Figure 11.18</strong></a>). A key protein encoded by cpDNA is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (abbreviated RuBisCO), which participates in the fixation of carbon in photosynthesis. RuBisCO makes up about 50% of the protein found in green plants and is therefore considered the most abundant protein on Earth. It is a complex protein consisting of eight identical large subunits and eight identical small subunits. The large subunit is encoded by chloroplast DNA, whereas the small subunit is encoded by nuclear DNA. Much of cpDNA consists of noncoding sequences.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_yNkjIx77Cq">As we have seen, many of the proteins found in modern mitochondria and chloroplasts are encoded by nuclear genes, which suggests that much of the genetic material in the original endosymbionts has been transferred to the nucleus over evolutionary time. This assumption is also supported by the observation that some DNA sequences normally found in mtDNA have been detected in the nuclear DNA of some strains of yeast and corn. Likewise, chloroplast sequences have been found in the nuclear DNA of spinach. Furthermore, the sequences of those nuclear genes that encode organelle proteins are most similar to their bacterial counterparts.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_7FsWVFC4Kd">There is also evidence that during evolution, genetic material has moved from chloroplasts to mitochondria. For example, DNA fragments from some rRNA genes that are normally found in cpDNA have been found in the mtDNA of corn. Sequences from the gene that encodes the large subunit of RuBisCO, which is normally encoded by cpDNA, are duplicated in corn mtDNA. And there is even evidence that some nuclear genes have moved into mitochondrial genomes. The exchange of genetic material between the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes over evolutionary time has given rise to the term “promiscuous DNA” to describe this phenomenon. The mechanism by which this exchange takes place is not entirely clear.</p>
