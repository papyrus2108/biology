<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_l626PF85X7">A thousand miles northeast of Australia lies an ancient chain of volcanic and coral islands known as the Solomons (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_jFD5QtpWF9"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch03_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ir059TR2np" id="ben_9781319297145_TPb5pPvBxJ">Figure 3.1</a></strong>). The Solomon Islands were first inhabited some 30,000 years ago, when Neanderthals still roamed northern Europe. Today, the people of the Solomons are culturally diverse but consist largely of Melanesians, a group that also inhabits other South Pacific islands. Most people from the Solomon Islands have dark skin. Remarkably, 5%–10% also have strikingly blond hair; in fact, people of the Solomon Islands have the highest frequency of blond hair outside Europe.</p>

The map which is zoomed out of the illustration shows the Solomon Islands in the Solomon Sea. The Islands are to the east of Papua New Guinea. Australia is south-west to the Solomon Islands. Vanuatu and New Caledonia are south-east to the islands and South Pacific Sea is in north-east. Coral Sea is to the south of these islands, South Pacific Sea is north east to these islands and Bismarck Sea is in the north-west side.</p></aside>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PTxFs8VPl7">How did the Solomon Islanders get their blond hair? A number of hypotheses have been proposed over the years. Some suggested that the blond islanders had naturally dark hair that was bleached by the sun and salt water. Others proposed that the blond hair color was caused by diet. Still others suggested that it was the result of genes for blond hair left by early European explorers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8Rms8QakaC">The mystery of the blond Solomon Islanders was solved in 2012 by geneticists Eimear Kenny and Sean Myles and their colleagues. Their research demonstrated that blond hair on the islands is, in fact, caused by a gene, but not one left by Europeans—blond hair in Solomon Islanders and in Europeans has completely separate evolutionary origins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_17ZUC8LTPH">To search for the origin of blond hair among the people of the Solomon Islands, the geneticists collected saliva and hair samples from over 1200 people on the islands, from which they extracted DNA. In a type of analysis known as a genome-wide association study, they looked for statistical associations between the presence of blond hair and thousands of genetic variants scattered across the genome. Right away, they detected a strong correlation between the presence of blond hair and a particular genetic variant located on the short arm of chromosome 9. This region of chromosome 9 contains the tyrosinase-related protein 1 (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ZDWdnFXhvG">TYRP1</i>) gene, which encodes an enzyme known to play a role in the production of melanin and to affect pigmentation in mice. The researchers found a single base difference between the DNA of islanders with blond hair and that of islanders with dark hair: the blonds had a thymine (T) base instead of cytosine (C) in their <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_euyeGRm6Um">TYRP1</i> gene.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_kHgyhitcCU">Further research showed that blond hair in Solomon Islanders is a recessive trait, meaning that blonds carry two copies of the blond version of the gene (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XBAdH4vJF2">TT</i>)—one inherited from each parent. Dark hair is dominant: dark-haired islanders carry either one (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ttp3X68lOl">CT</i>) or two (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_lez3XRWXvE">CC</i>) copies of the dark-hair version of the gene. Thus, many dark-haired islanders are heterozygous, carrying a hidden copy of the blond gene that can be passed on to their offspring. A DNA analysis of 900 Solomon Islanders demonstrated that over 40% of dark-haired islanders carry a blond gene. Interestingly, the C to T mutation in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_LkebjctU6b">TYRP1</i> gene that causes blond hair in Solomon Islanders is rare outside the South Pacific, suggesting that the mutation arose independently within the Melanesian population. There is no evidence that the gene was inherited from Europeans.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9WEg3nZ0aj">The genetics of blond hair in Solomon Islanders differs from that in Europeans in other ways as well. In Europeans, variations in at least eight different genes have been associated with blond hair. In 2015, researchers examined one of these genes (called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_cE2p7uslrZ">KITLG</i>) and found that the mutation causing blond hair occurred not in the gene itself but in a region of DNA that affects the expression of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_6vwjqxl2FO">KITLG</i> gene. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_mrLkLQK9Jc">KITLG</i> gene produces a protein that is involved in a number of functions, including melanocyte development and melanin synthesis.</p>

The principles of heredity were first put forth by Gregor Mendel, so we begin this chapter by examining Mendel’s scientific achievements. We then turn to simple genetic crosses in which a single characteristic is examined. We consider some techniques for predicting the outcome of genetic crosses, and then turn to crosses in which two or more characteristics are examined. We see how the principles applied to simple genetic crosses and the ratios of offspring they produce can serve as the key to understanding more complicated crosses. The chapter ends with a discussion of statistical tests for analyzing crosses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_YU0F0uayet">Throughout this chapter, a number of concepts are interwoven: Mendel’s principles of segregation and independent assortment, probability, and the behavior of chromosomes. These concepts might at first appear to be unrelated, but they are actually different views of the same phenomenon, because the genes that undergo segregation and independent assortment are located on chromosomes. In this chapter, we examine these different views and clarify how they are related.</p>
