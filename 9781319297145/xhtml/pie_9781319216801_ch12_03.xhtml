<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_vkOote5F8D">When Watson and Crick solved the three-dimensional structure of DNA in 1953 (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_AjmW6gf7Hi" id="ben_9781319297145_xs9EPvIJ5o">Figure 10.8</a>), several important genetic implications were immediately apparent. The complementary nature of the two nucleotide strands in a DNA molecule suggested that during replication, each strand can serve as a template for the synthesis of a new strand. The specificity of base pairing (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine) implied that only one sequence of bases can be specified by each template strand, and so the two DNA molecules built on the pair of templates will be identical to the original. This process is called

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JkUf4PfTrU">Initially, three models were proposed for DNA replication. In conservative replication (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_54z8JGggcs"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_OhlkxVe2cu" id="ben_9781319297145_dZbFHGAFrQ">Figure 12.1a</a></strong>), the entire double-stranded DNA molecule serves as a template for a whole new molecule of DNA, and the original DNA molecule is <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_nFrkeD3YEw">fully</i> conserved during replication. In dispersive replication (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_WhOIx0rSUG"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_OhlkxVe2cu" id="ben_9781319297145_T10ZHjIP7X">Figure 12.1b</a></strong>), both nucleotide strands break down (disperse) into fragments, which serve as templates for the synthesis of new DNA fragments, and then somehow reassemble into two complete DNA molecules. In this model, each resulting DNA molecule contains interspersed fragments of old and new DNA; none of the original molecule is conserved. Semiconservative replication (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_P92b70cOuF"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_OhlkxVe2cu" id="ben_9781319297145_dRcf5wK3Hg">Figure 12.1c</a></strong>) is intermediate between these two models; the two nucleotide strands unwind, and each serves as a template for a new DNA molecule.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_atmK3Cn7y6">These three models allow different predictions to be made about the distribution of original DNA and newly synthesized DNA after replication. With conservative replication, after one round of replication, 50% of the molecules would consist entirely of the original DNA and 50% would consist entirely of new DNA. After a second round of replication, 25% of the molecules would consist entirely of the original DNA and 75% would consist entirely of new DNA. With each additional round of replication, the proportion of molecules with new DNA would increase, although the number of molecules with the original DNA would remain constant. Dispersive replication would always produce hybrid molecules, containing some original and some new DNA, but the proportion of new DNA within the molecules would increase with each replication event. In contrast, with semiconservative replication, one round of replication would produce two hybrid molecules, each consisting of half original DNA and half new DNA. After a second round of replication, half the molecules would be hybrid and the other half would consist of new DNA only. Additional rounds of replication would <span aria-label="347" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page347" role="doc-pagebreak" title="347"/>produce more and more molecules consisting entirely of new DNA, but a few hybrid molecules would persist.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_5WQKkDq2rB">John Cairns provided the first visible evidence of theta replication in 1963 by growing bacteria in the presence of radioactive nucleotides. After replication, each DNA molecule consisted of one “hot” (radioactive) strand and one “cold” (nonradioactive) strand. Cairns isolated DNA from the bacteria after replication, placed it on an electron-microscope grid, and then covered it with a photographic emulsion. Radioactivity present in the sample exposed the emulsion and produced a picture of the molecule (called an autoradiograph) in a manner similar to the light that exposes a photographic film. Because the newly synthesized DNA contained radioactive nucleotides, Cairns was able to produce electron micrographs of the replication process similar to those shown in <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_ypp6K9K33E"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xpcO0QCRfB" id="ben_9781319297145_ZkwJ2ZiCOj">Figure 12.4b</a></strong>.</p>

Eukaryotic replication proceeds at a rate ranging from 500 to 5000 nucleotides per minute at each replication fork (considerably slower than bacterial replication). Even at 5000 nucleotides per minute at each fork, DNA synthesis starting from a single origin would require 7 days to replicate a typical human chromosome consisting of 100 million base pairs of DNA. The replication of eukaryotic chromosomes actually takes place in a matter of minutes or hours, not days. As discussed in the introduction to the chapter, this rapid rate is possible because replication is initiated at thousands of origins.</p>

These linear D N As have 3 origins of replication: origin 1, origin 2, and origin 3. A caption reads, each chromosome contains numerous origins. In the next step below, the replication begins at origin 1 and origin 2 as the D N A unwinds and a semi circular replication bubble that is protruding outwards is formed. A caption reads, at each origin, the D N A unwinds, producing a replication bubble. In the next step below, the newly formed red D N A strands begin to increase in length as the replication bubble proceed outwards and a new replication bubble forms at origin 3. A caption reads, D N A synthesis takes place on both strands at each end of the bubble as the replication forks stretch outward. The newly formed D N A strands below keep increasing in size. A caption reads, eventually, the forks of adjacent bubbles run into each other and the segments of D N A fuse. The next step below shows the D N A strands newly synthesized at origin 1 and origin 2 fuse to become a linear D N A strand while the replication fork at origin C continues extending outwards. This leads to formation of 2 linear red colored, newly synthesized strands below for each of the older gray strands. A caption reads, producing two identical linear D N A molecules. A caption reads, Conclusion: The products of eukaryotic D N A replication are two linear D N A molecules.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_Dnr0dmpTZE">Let’s relate the direction of DNA synthesis to the modes of replication examined earlier. In theta replication (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_AhpSTA8km7"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch12_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_xFV996w1Uz" id="ben_9781319297145_M7rZFencKB">Figure 12.10a</a></strong>), the DNA unwinds at one particular location, the origin, and a replication bubble is formed. If the bubble has two replication forks, one at each end, synthesis takes place simultaneously at both forks (bidirectional replication). At each fork, synthesis on one of the template strands proceeds in the same direction as that of unwinding; this newly replicated strand is the leading strand and is replicated continuously. On the other template strand, synthesis proceeds in the direction opposite that of unwinding; this newly synthesized strand is the lagging strand and is replicated discontinuously. Focus on just one of the template strands within the bubble. Notice that synthesis on this template strand is continuous at one fork but discontinuous at the other. This difference arises because DNA synthesis is always in the same direction (5<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_jG4Vh5WW6Q">′</i> → 3<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_npNjCkStAO">′</i>), but the two forks are moving in opposite directions.</p>

A caption reads, D N A unwinds at the origin. The unwinding and replication occur in both directions clockwise and anticlockwise from the origin. For the outer strand, the discontinuous lagging strand is synthesized anticlockwise and the continuous leading strand is also synthesized in the same direction (5 prime to 3 prime). A caption reads, at each fork, D N A synthesis of the leading strand proceeds continuously in the same direction as that of unwinding. For the inner strand, the continuous leading strand and discontinuous lagging strand are also anticlockwise. A caption reads, D N A synthesis of the lagging strand proceeds discontinuously in the direction opposite that of unwinding. Part b below shows rolling circle model. Circular D N A double strands unwinds at the origin in a clockwise direction. A continuous leading strand is synthesized in clockwise direction. A caption reads, continuous D N A synthesis begins at the 3 prime end of the broken nucleotide strand. As the leading strand is synthesized, the 5 prime end of the outer original D N A strand is displaced from its 5 prime end. A caption reads, as the D N A molecule unwinds, the 5 prime end is progressively displaced. Part c below shows linear eukaryotic replication. A double stranded D N A molecule unwinds in both left and right directions as a replication bubble is formed. The top strand, discontinuous lagging strand, and continuous leading strand are synthesized from right to left (from 5 prime to 3 prime). A caption reads, at each fork, the leading strand is synthesized continuously in the same direction as that of unwinding. The bottom strand, discontinuous lagging strand, and continuous leading strand are synthesized from left to right (from 5 prime to 3 prime).
