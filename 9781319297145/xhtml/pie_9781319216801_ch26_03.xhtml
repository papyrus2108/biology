<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_STjW9X0E2a">Because genetic variation must be present for evolution to take place, evolutionary biologists have long been interested in the amounts of genetic variation in natural populations and the forces that control the amount and nature of that variation. For many years, they could not examine genes directly and were limited to studying the phenotypes of organisms. Although genetic variation could not be quantified directly, studies of phenotypes suggested that many organisms within the same species harbor considerable genetic variation. Organisms in nature exhibit tremendous phenotypic variation. For example, butterflies of the species <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_xevf26Xvxg">Callimorpha</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_FOAHAhvrUL">Panaxia</i>) <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_8ILAKSH6Xt">dominula</i> (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_3VOXpeqX3R" id="ben_9781319297145_i7xydvQj7N"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_5Y10qDScVr">Figure 26.4</strong></a>) differ in spotting patterns, frogs within the species <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_19jQCp2u4J">Lithobates</i> (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Yr7Ex8RC3F">Rana</i>) <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_0MUHfKgkKG">pipiens</i> display variation in color and spotting patterns, field mice (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_A5K51Jngvo">Peromyscus maniculatus</i>) differ in the darkness of their fur, and humans vary in blood types, to mention just a few. Crosses revealed that some of these traits were inherited as simple genetic traits, but for most traits, the precise genetic basis was complex and unknown, preventing early evolutionary geneticists from quantifying the genetic variation in natural populations.</p>

Many organisms respond to artificial selection carried out by humans, suggesting that the populations of these organisms contain a great deal of additive genetic variation. For example, humans have used artificial selection to produce numerous dog breeds, which vary tremendously in size, shape, color, and behavior (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_2i2smz0ePo" id="ben_9781319297145_Vhno2KpTkx">Figure 24.21</a>).

The human genome, for example, contains 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA, which constitutes a large pool of information about our evolution.</li>

The evolutionary relationships between angiosperms were traditionally assessed by comparing floral anatomy, whereas the evolutionary relationships of bacteria were determined by their nutritional and staining properties. Because plants and bacteria have so few structural characteristics in common, evaluating how they are related to each other was difficult in the past. All organisms have certain molecular traits in common, such as ribosomal RNA sequences and some fundamental proteins. These molecules offer a valid basis for comparisons among all organisms.</li>

DNA sequence data often reveal processes that influence evolution, such as whether natural selection has taken place, and they are invaluable for determining the evolutionary relationships of different organisms. The use of PCR means that data can be obtained from a very small initial sample of DNA, which often facilitates studies of wild populations. For example, genetic variation in wolf populations (see the introduction to <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNqy757pBo" id="ben_9781319297145_K3Rz9WuHaz">Chapter 25</a>) has been measured and analyzed from DNA isolated from samples of wolf scat (feces).</p>

They obtained tissue samples from 195 elephants by shooting them with needlelike darts that fell to the ground after hitting an elephant but retained a small plug of skin. From the skin samples, the scientists sequenced 1732 base pairs of DNA from four nuclear genes. Their analysis revealed large genetic differences between forest elephants and savannah elephants, suggesting that there is limited gene flow (migration) between these two groups of elephants. On the basis of these results, the scientists proposed that two different species of elephants exist in Africa.</p>

This hypothesis, first developed by Motoo Kimura, suggests that most variations in DNA and protein sequences are functionally equivalent. Because they are functionally equivalent, natural selection does not differentiate between them, and their evolution is shaped largely by the random processes of genetic drift and mutation. The neutral-mutation hypothesis does not preclude the importance of natural selection; rather, it suggests that when selection occurs, it is largely directional, favoring the “best” allele while eliminating others. Thus, natural selection is viewed as an evolutionary force that largely limits variation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FCCMclnHKc">Research has shown, however, that some genetic variation is maintained by natural selection. In these cases, genetic variants are not functionally equivalent; instead, they result in phenotypic effects that cause differences in reproduction (fitness differences).

Overdominance, in which the heterozygote has higher fitness than either homozygote (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_wCAbCEjNws" id="ben_9781319297145_fFzneFK8IE">Section 25.4</a>), is one type of balancing selection. With overdominance, both alleles are maintained in a population because heterozygous individuals have the highest fitness and possess both alleles, so neither allele becomes fixed in the population. An example of overdominance is variation in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_wSTdOamHO7">β-globin</i> gene of humans that results in sickle-cell anemia: individuals heterozygous for an allele that causes sickle-cell anemia are resistant to malaria and thus have higher fitness than either homozygotes for the normal allele or homozygotes for the sickle-cell allele (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_qlyotIyscm" id="ben_9781319297145_mRkIhVuzxw">p. 786 in Chapter 25</a>).
