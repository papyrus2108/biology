<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_xcFpggY0yT">Rates of evolutionary change in nucleotide sequences are usually measured as the rate of nucleotide substitution, which is the number of substitutions taking place per nucleotide site per year within a population. To calculate the rate of nucleotide substitution, we begin by looking at homologous sequences from different organisms. We first align the homologous sequences, and then compare the sequences and determine the number of nucleotides that differ between the two sequences. We might compare the growth-hormone sequences for mice and rats, which diverged from a common ancestor some 15 million years ago. From the number of nucleotide differences between their growth-hormone genes, we compute the number of nucleotide substitutions that must have taken place since they diverged. Because the same site may have mutated more than once, the number of nucleotide substitutions is larger than the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences; special mathematical methods have been developed for inferring the actual number of substitutions likely to have taken place.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_57Dfems2fj">When we have the number of nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide site, we can use the total amount of evolutionary time that separates the two organisms (usually obtained from the fossil record) to obtain an overall rate of nucleotide substitution. For the mouse and rat growth-hormone genes, the overall rate of nucleotide substitution is approximately 8 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_6Qd50rINmw">−9</sup> substitutions per site per year.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_8LeCyAvbXJ">Nucleotide changes in a gene that alter the amino acid sequence of a protein are referred to as nonsynonymous substitutions. Nucleotide changes, particularly those at the third position of a codon, that do not alter the amino acid sequence of a protein are called synonymous substitutions. The rate of nonsynonymous substitution varies widely among mammalian genes. The rate for the α-actin protein is only 0.01 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_jIkaESUM9b">−9</sup> substitutions per site per year, whereas the rate for interferon γ is 2.79 × 10<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_Ivq1dP1r0b">−9</sup>, almost 300 times higher. The rate of synonymous substitution also varies among genes, but not as much as the nonsynonymous rate. For most protein-encoding genes, the rate of synonymous substitution is considerably higher than the nonsynonymous rate (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_53Uu529t2v"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_X4XEzvBVGf" id="ben_9781319297145_tHpNbKU2gj">Table 26.3</a></strong>) because synonymous mutations have little or no effect on fitness—that is, they are selectively <span aria-label="814" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page814" role="doc-pagebreak" title="814"/>neutral. Nonsynonymous mutations, on the other hand, alter the amino acid sequence of the protein and, in many cases, are detrimental to the fitness of the organism; most of these mutations are eliminated by natural selection.</p>

By determining the number of differences between the cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_VNYkbjPvIN">c</i> amino acid sequences of the two organisms, we can calculate the number of substitutions that have occurred per amino acid site. Because we know when these organisms last shared a common ancestor, we can determine the rate at which substitutions are occurring. Knowing how fast the molecular clock ticks then allows us to use the number of molecular differences in cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XOphCq8dza">c</i> to date other evolutionary events.</p>

For example, researchers used a molecular clock to estimate when Darwin’s finches diverged from a common ancestor that originally colonized the Galápagos Islands. This clock was based on DNA sequence differences in the cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_PlU1xjtyCQ">b</i> gene. The researchers concluded that the ancestor of Darwin’s finches arrived in the Galápagos and began diverging some 2 million to 3 million years ago. The results of several studies have shown, however, that the molecular clock does not always tick at a constant rate, particularly over shorter time periods, and this method remains controversial.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aa21leOFMO">One of the challenges of evolutionary biology is understanding the genetic basis of adaptation. Many evolutionary changes occur with relatively little genetic change. For example, humans and chimpanzees differ greatly in anatomy, physiology, and behavior, yet they differ at only about 4% of their DNA sequences (see the introduction to <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_2lkemoYRB5">Chapter 17</a>). Evolutionary biologists have long assumed that many anatomical differences result not from the evolution of new genes but rather from relatively small DNA differences that alter the expression of existing genes. Recent research in evolutionary genetics has focused on how evolution occurs through alteration of gene expression.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_RmkZ4tWD79">An example of adaptation that has occurred through changes in regulatory sequences is seen in the evolution of pigmentation in <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_x4VmdFGYom">Drosophila melanogaster</i> fruit flies in Africa. Most fruit flies are light tan in color, but flies in some African populations have much darker abdomens. These darker flies usually occur in mountainous regions at high elevations. Indeed, 59% of pigmentation variation among populations within Sub-Saharan Africa can be explained by differences in elevation (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_06.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_SK8dRyZxBh" id="ben_9781319297145_Xo965O9etx"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_NevrGopDws">Figure 26.18</strong></a>). Researchers have demonstrated that these differences are genetically determined and that natural selection has favored darker pigmentation at high elevations. High-elevation populations are exposed to lower temperatures, and the darker pigmentation is assumed to help flies absorb more solar radiation and better regulate their body temperature in these environments.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_MSfRIsU1la">How did flies at high elevations evolve darker color? Genetic studies indicate that the dark abdominal pigmentation seen in flies from these populations results from variation at or near a locus called <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gcup2UcmNq">ebony</i>. The <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_7DdHq6MPyn">ebony</i> locus encodes a multifunctional enzyme that produces a yellow exoskeleton; the absence of this enzyme produces a dark phenotype. Sequencing of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_llKtitbgOa">ebony</i> locus of flies from light and dark populations found no differences in the coding region of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_XcMk25xu9t">ebony</i> gene. However, molecular analysis revealed a marked reduction in the amount of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_BH96UIf71b">ebony</i> mRNA in darker flies, suggesting that the difference in pigmentation is due not to mutations in the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_fE2ypu2BG9">ebony</i> gene itself but rather to changes in its expression. Further investigation detected genetic differences within an enhancer that is about 3600 bp upstream of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_iv8c3vrseU">ebony</i> gene. Dark and light flies differed in over 120 nucleotides scattered over 2400 bp of the enhancer. By experimentally creating enhancers with different combinations of these mutations, researchers determined that five of the mutations are responsible for the majority of the difference in pigmentation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_8RgFldMd89">The results of these studies suggest that over time, high-elevation populations accumulated multiple mutations in the enhancer, which reduced the expression of the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_NDPduSKNv7">ebony</i> locus and caused darker pigmentation. Further analysis suggested that these mutations were added sequentially. Some of the mutations are widespread throughout Africa; it is assumed that these existing mutations were favored by natural selection in high-elevation populations and increased in frequency because they helped the flies thermoregulate in colder environments. Other mutations that are seen only in the high-elevation populations probably arose as new mutations within those populations and were quickly favored by natural selection.</p>

Primordial alpha-globin gene leads to chromosome 16 showing alpha-globin gene clusters as follows: zeta, psi-zeta, psi-alpha 2, psi-alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 1, and theta. Primordial beta-globin gene leads to chromosome 11 showing beta-globin gene cluster as follows: epsilon, G subscript gamma, A subscript gamma, psi-beta 1, lowercase delta, and beta.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_Gtj3Am2KN9">Some gene families include genes that are arrayed in tandem on the same chromosome; others are dispersed among different chromosomes. Gene duplication is a common occurrence in eukaryotic genomes; for example, about 5% of the human genome consists of duplicated segments.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_cCbU9jtDup">Gene duplication provides a mechanism for the generation of new genes with novel functions. Once a gene has been duplicated, there are two copies of that gene, one of which is then free to change and potentially take on a new function. The extra copy of the gene may, for example, become active at a different time in development, or be expressed in a different tissue, or even diverge and encode a protein containing different amino acids. The most common outcome of gene duplication, however, is that one copy acquires a mutation that renders it nonfunctional and becomes a pseudogene. Pseudogenes are common in the genomes of complex eukaryotes; the human genome is estimated to contain as many as 20,000 pseudogenes.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_1ZfN93EzoN">In addition to the duplication of individual genes, whole genomes of some organisms have been duplicated in the past. For example, a comparison of the genome of the yeast <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Yt5kSNJvRM">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> with the genomes of other fungi reveals that <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_VkjTEk9G9p">S. cerevisiae</i>, or one of its immediate ancestors, underwent a whole-genome duplication that generated two copies of every gene. Many of the copies subsequently acquired new functions; others acquired mutations that destroyed their original function and then diverged into random DNA sequences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rAcBCrjgF9">Whole-genome duplication can take place through polyploidy, as we saw in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch26_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Hj8C2zfv9m" id="ben_9781319297145_SYUHLrKS0x">Section 26.3</a>. During their evolution, plants have undergone a number of whole-genome duplications in this way. While polyploidy is less frequent <span aria-label="818" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page818" role="doc-pagebreak" title="818"/>in animals, genetic evidence suggests that several whole-genome duplication events have occurred during animal evolution. In 1970, Susumu Ohno proposed that early vertebrates underwent two rounds of genome duplication. Called the 2R hypothesis, this idea has been controversial, but recent data from genome sequencing have provided support for it. Among vertebrates, polyploidy has been particularly common in amphibians.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_aQgcKqvsiV">Traditionally, scientists assumed that organisms acquire their genomes through vertical transmission—transfer through the reproduction of genetic information from parents to offspring—and most phylogenetic trees assume vertical transmission of genetic information. Findings from DNA sequence studies reveal that DNA sequences are sometimes transmitted by horizontal gene transfer, in which DNA is transferred between individuals of different species (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch09_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GcMfia9hEx" id="ben_9781319297145_LX7QfUyVln">Section 9.3</a>). This process is especially common among bacteria, and there are a number of documented cases in which genes have been transferred from bacteria to eukaryotes. The extent of horizontal gene transfer among eukaryotic organisms is controversial, as there are few well-documented cases. Horizontal gene transfer can obscure phylogenetic relationships and make the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees difficult.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_afbz3MLWpV">One apparent case of horizontal gene transfer among eukaryotes is the presence in some aphids of genes for enzymes that synthesize carotenoids. Carotenoids are colored compounds produced by bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants. Many animals also possess carotenoids, but they lack the enzymes necessary to make the compounds themselves; in almost all cases, animals obtain carotenoids from their food.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_QEOuOdSno5">Aphids—small insects that feed on plants—possess carotenoids, which are responsible for color differences between and within species. Some aphids are green and contain α-, β-, and γ-carotene, which are all yellow carotenoids. Other aphids are red or brown and contain lycopene or torulene, carotenoids that are red. One species, the pea aphid (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2XlVPGv9C9">Acyrthosiphon pisum</i>), contains both green and red individuals, and these color differences are genetically inherited. Many researchers previously assumed that the color differences were due to carotenoids that were acquired in the aphids’ food.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_yFqTdufgJx">The sequencing of the entire genome of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_f9DWFGJcBB">A. pisum</i> provided researchers with the opportunity to determine whether the aphids possess their own genes for carotenoid synthesis. Examination of the genome sequence revealed that pea aphids have several genes that code for carotenoid-synthesizing enzymes. Interestingly, these genes are closely related to carotenoid-synthesizing genes found in some fungi. The evidence suggests that in the distant past, an aphid acquired its carotenoid genes from a fungus through horizontal gene transfer and then passed the genes to other aphids through vertical transmission.</p>
