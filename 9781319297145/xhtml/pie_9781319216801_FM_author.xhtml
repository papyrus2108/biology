<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_clpwS5FRW8">I still remember the excitement I felt when I was in your place, taking my first genetics course. I was intrigued by the principles of heredity, which allow one to predict what offspring will look like even before they are born; I was fascinated to learn that these principles have their foundation in the chemistry of an elegant molecule called DNA; and I was captivated to find that genetics underlies evolution, the process responsible for life’s endless diversity and beauty. These elements of genetics still impress and excite me today. One of the great things about teaching genetics is the chance to convey that excitement to students.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fe2e1k8Vvr">This book has been written in different places: in my office at Southwestern University, on the back porch of my home overlooking the hills of central Texas, in the mountains of northern New Mexico, and in airports and hotel rooms around the country. Regardless of location, whenever I write, I try to imagine that I’m sitting with a small group of students, having a conversation about genetics. My goal as the author of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_akwIIduC6E">Genetics: A Conceptual Approach</i> is to have that conversation with you. I want to become a trusted guide on your journey through introductory genetics. In this book, I’ve tried to share some of what I’ve learned in my years of teaching genetics. I provide advice and encouragement at places where students often have difficulty, and I tell stories of the people, places, and experiments of genetics—past and present—to keep the subject relevant, interesting, and alive. My goal is to help you learn the necessary details, concepts, and problem-solving skills while encouraging you to see the elegance and beauty of the larger landscape.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_JR3SsHUYzT">Educational research demonstrates that students learn best when they are actively engaged with their subject, and this has been my own experience in teaching and learning. In this seventh edition of <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_P0dLNrvbvf">Genetics: A Conceptual Approach</i>, I wanted to share some active learning tools that I use in my own classroom: think-pair-share and concept mapping questions—exercises designed for small group work—as well as extensive problem sets at the end of each chapter. Additional group learning exercises and digital learning tools are provided on the SaplingPlus web site. I encourage you to take advantage of these resources and work with other students in learning genetics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_sb94Yrpgnf">At Southwestern University, my office door is always open, and my students often drop by to share their experiences, concerns, and triumphs. I learn as much from my students as they learn from me, and I would love to learn from you—by email (<a class="external" href="mailto://pierceb@southwestern.edu" id="ben_9781319297145_aDkRYYKKlU">pierceb@southwestern.edu</a>), by telephone (512-863-1974), or in person (Southwestern University, Georgetown, Texas).</p>
