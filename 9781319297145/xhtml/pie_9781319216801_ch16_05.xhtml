<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_nLHNxZ6qLn">An enhancer is a DNA element that affects transcription, but in contrast to promoters, an enhancer is typically found some distance from the gene whose transcription it affects (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_5lnSPYWvZw" id="ben_9781319297145_NiJWLcPWCW">Chapter 17</a>). Enhancers were originally described in eukaryotes, but research now indicates that some also occur in bacteria and archaea.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_rRVDnRvIpF">Like enhancers in eukaryotes, bacterial enhancers contain binding sites for proteins that increase the rate of transcription at promoters that are distant from the enhancer. They do this by causing the DNA between the promoter and the enhancer to loop out, so that the transcription activator bound to the enhancer directly interacts with RNA polymerase at the promoter. Enhancers are position independent, meaning that they can be moved without affecting their ability to enhance transcription. Most bacterial enhancers are found upstream of genes that use a special type of sigma factor (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch13_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_KBBmwjHUS4" id="ben_9781319297145_z4wAErKFiL">Chapter 13</a>) known as sigma 54 (σ<sup class="semantic-sup" id="ben_9781319297145_vKYp9I6VuW">54</sup>).

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2P9Ik6gtnY">An example of a riboswitch is seen in the bacterial genes that encode enzymes that play roles in the synthesis of vitamin B12. The genes for these enzymes are transcribed into an mRNA molecule that contains a riboswitch. When the activated form of vitamin B12—called coenzyme B12—is present, it binds to the riboswitch, and the mRNA folds into a secondary structure that obstructs the ribosome-binding site. Consequently, no translation of the mRNA takes place. In the absence of coenzyme B12, the mRNA assumes a different secondary structure. This secondary structure does not obstruct the ribosome-binding site, so translation is initiated, the enzymes are synthesized, and vitamin B12 is produced. For some riboswitches, the regulatory molecule acts as a repressor (as just described) by inhibiting transcription or translation; for others, the regulatory molecule acts as an inducer by causing the formation of a secondary structure that allows transcription or translation to take place.</p>
