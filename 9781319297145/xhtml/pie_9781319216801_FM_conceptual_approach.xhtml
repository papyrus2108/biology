Otto Mackensen studied linkage relations among eight mutations in honeybees (O. Mackensen. 1958. Journal of Heredity 49: 99 to 102).

His 46, X Y brother is also color blind. Both parents have color vision. In which parent and where in meiosis did the nondisjunction that gave rise to the young man with Klinefelter syndrome take place? Assume that no crossing over took place in prophase 1 of meiosis (see Chapter 2).</p>
