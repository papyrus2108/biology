<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_wz1xU65X0w">Genetic maps reveal the relative positions of genes on a chromosome, but they do not provide information that allows us to place groups of linked genes on particular chromosomes. Furthermore, the units of a genetic map do not always precisely correspond to physical distances on the chromosome, <span aria-label="207" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page207" role="doc-pagebreak" title="207"/>because a number of factors other than physical distances between genes (such as the type and sex of the organism) can influence recombination.

The two nuclei of a heterokaryon eventually also fuse, generating a hybrid cell that contains chromosomes from both cell lines. If human and mouse cells are mixed in the presence of polyethylene glycol, their fusion results in human–mouse somatic-cell hybrids (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_rhDEPJgTqV"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_WDvNEsD34w" id="ben_9781319297145_LdaU1zI0y3">Figure 7.20</a></strong>). The hybrid cells tend to lose chromosomes as they divide, and for reasons that are not understood, chromosomes from one of the species are lost preferentially. In human–mouse somatic-cell hybrids, the human chromosomes tend to be lost, whereas the mouse chromosomes are retained. Eventually, the chromosome number stabilizes when all but a few of the human chromosomes have been lost. Chromosome loss is random and differs among cell lines. The presence of these “extra” human chromosomes in the mouse genome makes it possible to assign human genes to specific chromosomes.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_El63tHOEBH">Mapping genes by using somatic-cell hybridization requires a panel of different hybrid cell lines. Each cell line is examined microscopically, and the human chromosomes that it contains are identified. The cell lines of the panel are chosen so that they differ in the human chromosomes that they have retained. For example, one hybrid cell line might possess human chromosomes 2, 4, 7, and 8, whereas another might possess chromosomes 4, 19, and 20. Each cell line in the panel is examined for evidence of a particular human gene. The human gene can be detected by looking either for the gene itself (as discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_uH1cWVxNKJ">Chapter 19</a>) or for the protein that it produces. Correlation of the presence of the gene with the presence of specific human chromosomes often allows the gene to be assigned to the correct chromosome. For example, if a gene is detected in both of the aforementioned cell lines, the gene must be on chromosome 4 because it is the only human chromosome common to both cell lines (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_RohDppAbyG"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FsmQoni1Wb" id="ben_9781319297145_0domTPOmhd">Figure 7.21</a></strong>). Somatic-cell hybridization is used less often today because DNA sequencing and mapping with molecular markers can often establish the chromosomal locations of linkage groups.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_h0vDbQf5QC">Deletion mapping has been used in the past to reveal the chromosomal locations of a number of human genes. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a disease that causes progressive weakening and degeneration of the muscles (see introduction to <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch19_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_LOQ40viYWJ" id="ben_9781319297145_oiB5CEePqX">Chapter 19</a>). From its X-linked pattern of inheritance, the mutant allele causing this disorder was known to be on the X chromosome, but its precise location was uncertain. Examination of a number of patients with the disease who also possessed small deletions allowed researchers to position the gene on a small segment of the short arm of the X chromosome. Like somatic-cell hybridization, deletion mapping is used less often today because of the widespread availability of DNA sequencing. <strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_5K6fEL202v">❯ TRY <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch07_08.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_XDZef8TlXA" id="ben_9781319297145_O18e29ZOXy">PROBLEM 41</a></strong><span aria-label="209" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" role="doc-pagebreak" title="209"/></p>
