X-linked traits, for example, are passed from father to daughter but never from father to son, and Y-linked traits are passed from father to all sons. Here we examine additional influences of sex, including the effect of the sex of an individual organism on the expression of autosomal genes, on characteristics determined by genes located in the cytoplasm, and on characteristics for which the genotype of only the maternal parent determines the phenotype of the offspring. Finally, we look at situations in which the expression of autosomal genes is affected by the sex of the parent from whom the genes are inherited.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_9hc0yPi0In">An example of a sex-limited characteristic in humans is male-limited precocious puberty. There are several types of precocious puberty in humans, most of which are not genetic. Male-limited precocious puberty, however, results from an autosomal dominant allele (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RQJv8meFdQ">P</i>) that is expressed only in males; females with this allele are normal in phenotype. Males with precocious puberty undergo puberty at an early age, usually before the age of four. At this time, the penis enlarges, the voice deepens, and pubic hair develops. There is no impairment of sexual function; affected males are fully fertile. Most are short as adults because the long bones stop growing after puberty.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_o69RbFBaGw">Because the trait is rare, affected males are usually heterozygous (<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_Pi8l6eyqaA">Pp</i>).

For most genetic characteristics, this assumption is valid, and Mendel’s principles allow us to predict the types of offspring that will be produced in a genetic cross. Not all the genetic material of a cell is found in the nucleus, however. Some characteristics are encoded by genes located in the cytoplasm, and these characteristics exhibit

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_o5XIWk4qKm">A few organelles, notably chloroplasts and mitochondria, contain DNA. The human mitochondrial genome contains about 16,569 nucleotides of DNA, encoding 37 genes. Compared with the nuclear genome, which contains some 3 billion nucleotides encoding some 20,000 genes, the mitochondrial genome is very small; nevertheless, mitochondrial and chloroplast genes encode some important characteristics. The molecular characteristics of this extranuclear DNA are discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch11_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_CVjYrfncTB" id="ben_9781319297145_wkDAViI6xM">Chapter 11</a>; here, we focus on <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1dT35GBUT1">patterns</i> of cytoplasmic inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_w6lPlhpKQh">Cytoplasmic inheritance differs from the inheritance of characteristics encoded by nuclear genes in several important respects. A zygote inherits nuclear genes from both parents, but typically all its cytoplasmic organelles, and thus all its cytoplasmic genes, come from only one of the gametes, usually the egg. A sperm from the male parent generally contributes only a set of nuclear genes. Thus, most cytoplasmically inherited traits are present in both males <span aria-label="131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" role="doc-pagebreak" title="131"/>and females and are passed from mother to offspring, never from father to offspring. Reciprocal crosses, therefore, give different results when cytoplasmic genes encode a trait. In a few organisms, however, cytoplasmic genes are inherited from the male parent only or from both parents.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_gE8eDWtYcc">Cytoplasmically inherited characteristics frequently exhibit extensive phenotypic variation because no mechanism analogous to mitosis or meiosis ensures that cytoplasmic genes are evenly distributed during cell division. Thus, different cells and different individual offspring will contain various proportions of cytoplasmic genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_UpjAeLMtdP">Consider mitochondrial genes. Most cells contain thousands of mitochondria, and each mitochondrion contains from 2 to 10 copies of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Suppose that half of the mitochondria in a cell contain a normal wild-type copy of mtDNA and the other half contain a mutated copy (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_XGIykX924R" id="ben_9781319297145_iJ6iq0ynPe"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_sxQQ5WEf0J">Figure 5.15</strong></a>). During cell division, the mitochondria segregate into the progeny cells at random. Just by chance, one cell may receive mostly mutated mtDNA and another cell may receive mostly wild-type mtDNA. Therefore, different progeny from the same mother, and even different cells within an individual offspring, may vary in their phenotypes. Traits encoded by chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) are similarly variable.

Correns found that some of the leaves and stems of one variety of four-o’clock were variegated, displaying a mixture of green and white splotches. He also noted that some branches of the variegated strain had all-green leaves; other branches had all-white leaves. Each branch produced flowers, so Correns was able to cross flowers from variegated, green, and white branches in all combinations (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_5qvcEP8FKd"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch05_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_kghSXKnETp" id="ben_9781319297145_aW706lbGT3">Figure 5.16</a></strong>). The seeds from flowers on green branches always gave rise to green progeny, no matter whether the pollen was from a green, white, or variegated branch. Similarly, flowers on white branches always produced white progeny. Flowers on the variegated branches gave rise to green, white, and variegated progeny in no particular ratio.</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_t3mhw8xx8m">Correns’s crosses demonstrated the cytoplasmic inheritance of variegation in four-o’clocks. The phenotypes of the offspring were determined entirely by the maternal parent, never by the paternal parent (the source of the pollen). Furthermore, the production of all three phenotypes by flowers on variegated branches is consistent with cytoplasmic inheritance. The white color in these plants is caused by a defective gene in cpDNA, which results in a failure to produce the green pigment chlorophyll. Cells from green branches contain normal chloroplasts only, cells from white branches contain abnormal chloroplasts only, and cells from variegated branches contain a mixture of normal and abnormal chloroplasts. In the flowers from variegated branches, the random segregation of chloroplasts in the course of oogenesis produces some egg cells with only normal cpDNA, <span aria-label="132" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" role="doc-pagebreak" title="132"/>which develop into green progeny; other egg cells with only abnormal cpDNA, which develop into white progeny; and still other egg cells with a mixture of normal and abnormal cpDNA, which develop into variegated progeny.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_dyJUWPSjlP">A number of human diseases (mostly rare ones) that exhibit cytoplasmic inheritance have been identified. These disorders arise from mutations in mtDNA, most of which occur in genes encoding components of the electron-transport chain, which generates most of the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in aerobic cellular respiration. One such disease is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). People who have this disorder experience rapid loss of vision in both eyes, which results from the death of cells in the optic nerve. This loss of vision typically occurs in early adulthood (usually between the ages of 20 and 24), but it can occur any time after adolescence. There is much clinical variation in the severity of the disease, even within the same family. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy exhibits cytoplasmic inheritance: the trait is passed from a mother to all her children, sons and daughters alike.</p>

A caption reads, “Dextral, a right-handed coil, results from an autosomal allele (small S superscript positive) that is dominant over an allele for sinistral (small S), which encodes a left-handed coil.” Meiosis results in the formation of gametes as follows: small S superscript positive from the male and small S from the female. Fertilization occurs and leads to the big F subscript 1 generation below which has sinistral offspring with genotype small S superscript positive small S. A caption referring to the progeny reads, “All the big F subscript 1 are heterozygous (small S superscript positive small S); because the genotype of the mother determines the phenotype of the offspring, all the big F subscript 1 have a sinistral shell.” This progeny produced in F subscript 1 generation undergoes meiosis and forms two gametes with genotype small S superscript positive and small S respectively which are self-fertilized. This self-fertilization results in the production of progeny subscript 2 generation below. The progeny are as follows: one-fourth dextral with genotype small S superscript positive small S superscript positive; one-half dextral with genotype S superscript positive small S; and one-fourth dextral with genotype small S small S. A caption reads, Conclusion: Because the mother of the big F subscript 2 progeny has genotype small s superscript positive small s, all the F subscript 2 snails are dextral.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_d1BdwbEamB">A basic tenet of Mendelian genetics is that the parental origin of a gene does not affect its expression and, therefore, reciprocal crosses give identical results. We have seen, however, that there are some genetic characteristics—those encoded by X-linked genes and cytoplasmic genes—for which reciprocal crosses do not give the same results. In these cases, males and females do not contribute the same genetic material to the offspring. Males and females do contribute the same number of autosomal genes to their offspring, and paternal and maternal autosomal genes have long been assumed to have equal effects. However, the expression of some autosomal genes is significantly affected by their parental origin. This differential expression of genetic material depending on whether it is inherited from the male or the female parent is called

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_TWTUEQgQfY">Genomic imprinting has been implicated in several human disorders, including Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes. Children with Prader–Willi syndrome have small hands and feet, short stature, poor sexual development, and intellectual disability. These children are small at birth and nurse poorly, but as toddlers they develop voracious appetites and frequently become obese. Many people <span aria-label="134" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page134" role="doc-pagebreak" title="134"/>with Prader–Willi syndrome are missing a small region on the long arm of chromosome 15. The deletion of this region is always inherited from the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_gMt6seTgZF">father</i>. Thus, children with Prader–Willi syndrome lack a paternal copy of genes on the long arm of chromosome 15.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_fOozAAREID">The deletion of this same region of chromosome 15 can also be inherited from the <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_L2LZkYWEla">mother</i>, but this inheritance results in a completely different set of symptoms, producing Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome exhibit frequent laughter, uncontrolled muscle movement, a large mouth, and unusual seizures. They are missing a maternal copy of genes on the long arm of chromosome 15. For normal development to take place, copies of this region of chromosome 15 from both male and female parents are apparently required.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FvlCiip8ec">Many imprinted genes in mammals are associated with fetal growth. Imprinting has also been reported in plants, with differential expression of paternal and maternal genes in the endosperm, which, like the placenta in mammals, provides nutrients for the growth of the embryo. The mechanism of imprinting is still under investigation, but the methylation of DNA—the addition of methyl (CH<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_y74jLE8UTD">2</sub>) groups to DNA nucleotides (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch10_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_oJZ6HW27Pi" id="ben_9781319297145_ycIbMOA4l4">Chapters 10</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch17_03.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_h0RxTRZJqF" id="ben_9781319297145_ROuoAj2mQR">17</a>)—is essential to the process. In mammals, methylation is erased in the germ cells each generation and then reestablished in the course of gamete formation, with sperm and eggs undergoing different levels of methylation, which then cause the differential expression of male and female alleles in the offspring.

However, some traits are determined by modifications to DNA or chromatin—such as DNA methylation—that affect the way in which DNA sequences are expressed. These changes are often stable and heritable in the sense that they are passed from one cell to another. For example, in genomic imprinting, whether a gene passes through the egg or the sperm determines how much methylation of the DNA takes place. The pattern of methylation on a gene is copied when the DNA is replicated and therefore remains on the gene as it is passed from cell <span aria-label="135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" role="doc-pagebreak" title="135"/>to cell through mitosis. However, the methylation may be modified or removed when the DNA passes through a gamete, so a gene that is methylated in sperm may be unmethylated when it is eventually passed down to a daughter’s egg. Ultimately, the amount of methylation determines whether the gene is expressed in the offspring.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_aCs3aaFat6">These types of reversible changes to DNA that influence the expression of traits are termed epigenetic marks. The inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in female mammals (discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch04_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_f2TMw9nQp4" id="ben_9781319297145_1qrcPoFu2a">Chapter 4</a>) is another type of epigenetic change.

Epigenetic marks are reversible changes in DNA that do not alter the base sequence but may affect how a gene is expressed.</p>
