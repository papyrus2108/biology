<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_r91WiMEX6O">If all reproduction were accomplished through mitosis, life would be quite dull because mitosis produces only genetically identical progeny. With only mitosis, you, your children, your parents, your brothers and sisters, your cousins, and many people whom you don’t even know would be clones—copies of one another. Only the occasional mutation would introduce any genetic variation. All organisms reproduced in this way for the first 2 billion years of Earth’s existence (and some organisms still do today). Then, about 1.5 billion to 2 billion years ago, something remarkable evolved: cells that produce genetically variable offspring through sexual reproduction.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_lWV4BrODQS">The evolution of sexual reproduction is among the most significant events in the history of life. As will be discussed in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch24_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_9qSZO3sHgt" id="ben_9781319297145_v5uqBlTGa9">Chapters 24</a> and <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch25_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_TNqy757pBo" id="ben_9781319297145_yXq3fXITrj">25</a>, the pace of evolution depends on the amount of genetic variation present. By shuffling the genetic information from two parents, sexual reproduction greatly increases the amount of genetic variation and allows for accelerated evolution. Most of the tremendous diversity of life on Earth is a direct result of sexual reproduction.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_2Nb6uLvRhS">The words <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_2j6EqWPCzj">mitosis</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_1z9TFJNTFS">meiosis</i> are sometimes confused. They sound a bit alike and may appear superficially similar. But don’t be deceived. The outcomes of mitosis and meiosis are radically different, and several unique events that have important genetic consequences take place only in meiosis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_SyeZjbJanl">How does meiosis differ from mitosis? Mitosis consists of a single nuclear division and is usually accompanied by a single cell division. Meiosis, on the other hand, consists of two divisions. After mitosis, the chromosome number in the newly formed cells is the same as that in the original cell, whereas meiosis causes the chromosome number in the newly formed cells to be reduced by half. Finally, mitosis produces genetically identical cells, whereas meiosis produces genetically variable cells. Let’s see how these differences arise.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_6YN134CPp2">Like mitosis, meiosis is preceded by an interphase that includes G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_RKsBi3eS0k">1</sub>, S, and G<sub class="semantic-sub" id="ben_9781319297145_ycLZz4EHUO">2</sub> stages. Meiosis consists of two distinct processes: meiosis I and meiosis II, each of which includes a cell division. The first division, which comes at the end of meiosis I, is termed the reduction division because the number of chromosomes per cell is reduced by half (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_0vvaQdvepe" id="ben_9781319297145_MeONMDlHqa"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Gx4dAIFchQ">Figure 2.13</strong></a>). The second division, which comes at the end of meiosis II, is sometimes termed the equational division. The events of meiosis II are similar to those of mitosis. However, meiosis II differs from mitosis in that chromosome number has already been halved in meiosis I, so the cell does not begin with the same number of chromosomes as it does in mitosis (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_0vvaQdvepe" id="ben_9781319297145_wrKDnuNo2z">Figure 2.13</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_ePqJDk4ust">What are the overall consequences of meiosis? First, meiosis comprises two divisions, so each original cell produces four cells (although there are exceptions to this generalization, as, for example, in many female animals; see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_ZtL6pds7WD" id="ben_9781319297145_dvOsKa7sGc">Figure 2.20b</a>). Second, chromosome number is reduced by half, so cells produced by meiosis are haploid. Third, cells produced by meiosis are genetically different from one another and from the parent cell. These genetic differences result from two processes that are unique to meiosis: crossing over and the random separation of homologous chromosomes.</p>

Evidence from yeast suggests that crossing over is initiated in zygotene, before the synaptonemal complex develops, and is not completed until near the end of prophase I (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_nY73RK3tPv" id="ben_9781319297145_n8Rgz3myAH">Figure 2.14</a>).

The second picture shows the cell in prophase in mitosis and prophase 1 in meiosis, when there are 2 sets of intact X-shaped chromosomes (two red chromosomes where one chromosome is smaller than other and two blue chromosomes where one chromosome is smaller than other). Spindle fibers are produced over the nucleus as the centrosomes drift apart. No crossing over takes place in mitosis and 4 chromosomes are arranged randomly.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_NvbBOm26Qn">As we have seen, mitosis and meiosis differ fundamentally in the behavior of chromosomes in anaphase (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_1y9GV9aMBj" id="ben_9781319297145_po5M3jonw7">Figure 2.18</a>). Why do homologs separate in anaphase I of meiosis, whereas chromatids separate in anaphase of mitosis and anaphase II of meiosis? It is important to note that the forms of cohesin used in mitosis and meiosis differ. At the beginning of meiosis, the meiosis-specific cohesin is found along the entire length of a chromosome’s arms (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_WUZVHH95fe"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_GNyMZaW23q" id="ben_9781319297145_wXspqrzBpO">Figure 2.19c</a></strong>). The cohesin also acts on the chromosome arms of homologs at the chiasmata—the crossover points between homologous chromosomes—tethering two homologs together at their ends.</p>

The sister kinetochores are drawn as dots on the middle of the chromatids and originate from a grey structure at the center of the chromatids. The spindle fibers emerge out from these grey structures. The cohesion, represented by pink circles in between the chromatids, holds the sister chromatids together. A caption reads, “Sister kinetochores orient toward different poles, and cohesin keeps sister chromatids together.” This leads to next stage metaphase where breakdown of cohesin occurs. The breakdown in cohesin is shown by the pink circles breaking in half. As a result, the sister chromatids separate.

A caption reads, “Cohesin along chromosome arms breaks down, allowing homologs to separate but cohesin at the centromere is protected by shugoshin.” Breakdown of centromeric cohesion occurs and this leads to next stage anaphase 2. The third diagram shows anaphase 2. The shugoshin is degrade as the blue dots have disappeared. The spindle fibers emerge out from green structures and almost V shaped chromatids are pulled away from each other. A caption reads, “Shugoshin is degraded.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_OVJVLMaicF">In anaphase I, cohesin along the chromosome arms is broken, allowing the two homologs to separate. However, cohesin at the centromere is protected by a protein called shugoshin, which means “guardian spirit” in Japanese. Because of the protective action of shugoshin, the centromeric cohesin remains intact and prevents the separation of the two sister chromatids during anaphase I. Shugoshin is subsequently degraded.

Only the ovum is capable of being fertilized, and the polar bodies usually disintegrate. Oogenesis, then, produces a single mature gamete from each primary oocyte.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_PuQ364dPyf">In mammals, oogenesis differs from spermatogenesis in another way. The formation of sperm takes place continuously in a male throughout his adult reproductive life. The formation of female gametes, however, is often a discontinuous process and may take place over a period of years. Oogenesis begins before birth; at this time, oogonia initiate meiosis and give rise to primary oocytes. Meiosis is then arrested, stalled in prophase I. Thus, a female is born with primary oocytes arrested in prophase I. In humans, this period of suspended animation may last 30 or 40 years, until rising hormone levels stimulate one or more of the primary oocytes to recommence meiosis. The first division of meiosis is completed, and a secondary oocyte is ovulated from the ovary (a process called ovulation). In humans and many other species, the second division of meiosis is then delayed until contact with the sperm. When a sperm penetrates the outer layer of the secondary oocyte, the second meiotic division takes place, the second polar body is extruded from the ovum, and the nuclei of the sperm and newly formed ovum fuse, giving rise to the zygote.</p>

These two generations alternate; the sporophyte produces haploid spores through meiosis, and the gametophyte produces haploid gametes through mitosis (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_Q5fV87i028"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch02_04.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_Dfd71lyyVz" id="ben_9781319297145_sIi3N3x35K">Figure 2.21</a></strong>). This type of life cycle is sometimes called alternation of generations. In this cycle, the immediate products of meiosis are called spores, not gametes; the spores undergo one or more mitotic divisions to produce gametes. Although the terms used to describe the plant life cycle are somewhat different from those commonly used for animals (and from some of those employed so far in this chapter), the processes in plants and animals are basically the same: in both, meiosis leads to a reduction in chromosome number, producing haploid cells.</p>
