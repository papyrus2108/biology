<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_XB3TKtmJ8J">Millions of people with type 1 diabetes mellitus inject themselves daily with pure insulin to compensate for the lack of production of this critical hormone by their own pancreatic <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Gn5y3apCiZ">β</i> cells. Insulin injection is not a cure for diabetes, but it allows people who otherwise would have died young to lead long and productive lives. The discovery of insulin, which began with an accidental observation, illustrates the combination of serendipity and careful experimentation that led to the discovery of many hormones.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_TxeTCqX7rx">In 1889, Oskar Minkowski, a young assistant at the Medical College of Strasbourg, and Josef von Mering, at the Hoppe-Seyler Institute in Strasbourg, had a friendly disagreement about whether the pancreas, known to contain lipases, was important in fat digestion in dogs. To resolve the issue, they began an experiment on the digestion of fats. They surgically removed the pancreas from a dog, but before their experiment got any farther, Minkowski noticed that the dog was now producing far more urine than normal (a common symptom of untreated diabetes). Also, the dog’s urine had glucose levels far above normal (another symptom of diabetes). These findings suggested that lack of some pancreatic product caused diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Y0FuubKQgY">Minkowski tried unsuccessfully to prepare an extract of dog pancreas that would reverse the effect of removing the pancreas — that is, would lower the urinary or blood glucose levels. Despite considerable effort, no significant progress was made in the isolation or characterization of the “antidiabetic factor” until the summer of 1921, when Frederick G. Banting, a young scientist working in the laboratory of J. J. R. MacLeod at the University of Toronto, and a student assistant, Charles Best, took up the problem. By that time, several lines of evidence pointed to a group of specialized cells in the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_kVn99vUQSP" id="dav_9781319322342_HyzA3ORCgx">Fig. 23-23</a>) as the source of the antidiabetic factor, which came to be called insulin (from Latin <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_feRnQZWKRU">insula</i>, “island”).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6ORakfhaDs">Taking precautions to prevent proteolysis by the pancreatic proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin, Banting and Best (later aided by biochemist J. B. Collip) succeeded in December 1921 in preparing a purified pancreatic extract that cured the symptoms of experimentally induced diabetes in dogs. On January 25, 1922 (just one month later!), their insulin preparation was injected into Leonard Thompson, a 14-year-old boy severely ill with diabetes mellitus. Within days, the levels of ketone bodies and glucose in Thompson’s urine dropped dramatically; the extract saved his life and the lives of other seriously ill children who also received these early preparations (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_8VrtSkJSe4" id="dav_9781319322342_Z9VUSUydpn">Fig. 1</a>). In 1923, Banting and MacLeod won the Nobel Prize for their isolation of insulin. Banting immediately announced that he would share his prize with Best; MacLeod shared his with Collip.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_1MmiD5e3bh">By 1923, pharmaceutical companies were supplying thousands of patients throughout the world with insulin extracted from porcine pancreas. With the development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1980s, it became possible to produce unlimited quantities of human insulin by inserting the cloned human gene for insulin into a microorganism, which was then cultured on an industrial scale. Many people with diabetes are now fitted with implanted insulin pumps, which release adjustable amounts of insulin on demand to meet changing needs at meal times and during exercise. There is a reasonable prospect that, in the future, transplanted pancreatic tissue will provide a source of insulin that responds as well as a normal pancreas, releasing insulin into the bloodstream only when blood glucose rises.</p>

This disease responds to insulin injection, because the metabolic defect <span aria-label="876" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page876" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stems from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_KVPhsMRAgy">β</i> cells and a consequent inability to produce sufficient insulin. Type 1 diabetes requires both insulin therapy and careful, lifelong control of the balance between dietary intake, activity, and insulin dose. Characteristic symptoms of untreated type 1 (and type 2) diabetes are excessive thirst and frequent urination, leading to the intake of large volumes of water. These symptoms are due to excretion of large amounts of glucose in the urine. (“Diabetes mellitus” means “excessive excretion of sweet urine.”)</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_56tDXYviLz">Type 2 diabetes is slower to develop (typically but not always in obese adults), and the symptoms are milder <span aria-label="877" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page877" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and often go unrecognized at first. This is really a group of diseases in which the regulatory activity of insulin is disordered: insulin is produced, but some feature of the insulin-response system is defective. Many individuals with this disorder are insulin-resistant. The connection between type 2 diabetes and obesity (discussed below) is an active area of research.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZNaGmr0o02">The pathology of diabetes includes cardiovascular disease, renal failure, blindness, and neuropathy. In 2019, the global mortality from diabetes was estimated at 4.2 million and rising. It is essential to understand diabetes and its relationship to obesity and to find countermeasures that prevent or reverse the damage done by this disease.</p>

Recall that insulin triggers the movement of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane in muscle and adipose tissue (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZlYEZZHuqs" id="dav_9781319322342_LA40lxlJuB">Fig. 12-23</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_VMr6ztRzGo" id="dav_9781319322342_l29NX9i9Gy">Box 11-1</a>). Biochemical measurements on blood and urine samples are essential in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. A sensitive diagnostic criterion is the level of HbA1c, a glucose derivative of hemoglobin, which forms in the blood and reflects the average blood glucose level (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_c1XvSQj5GD" id="dav_9781319322342_7Op3xxlo3M">Box 7-2</a>). Another measurement to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes is the <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_oayIQa1Y9z">glucose-tolerance test</dfn>. The individual fasts overnight, then drinks a test dose of 100 g of glucose dissolved in a glass of water. The blood glucose concentration is measured before the test dose and at 30 min intervals for several hours thereafter. A healthy individual assimilates the glucose readily, the blood glucose rising to no more than about 9 or 10 m<span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_dimrw9sOXD">m</span>; little or no glucose appears in the urine. In diabetes, individuals assimilate the test dose of glucose poorly; their blood glucose level rises dramatically and returns to the fasting level very slowly. Because the blood glucose levels exceed the kidney threshold (about 10 m<span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_s4jrkwKA2o">m</span>), glucose also appears in the urine. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_MwfiNL40xm" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_14_pg523.png"/></p>

In overweight individuals, excess caloric intake results in enlarged adipocytes, engorged with TAG and unable to store more. Enlarged adipocytes secrete MCP-1 (monocyte chemotaxis protein-1), attracting macrophages. Macrophages infiltrate the adipose tissue and produce TNF<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_MJG6saDPa7">α</i> (tumor necrosis factor <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_EJ1tbki4RM">α</i>), which triggers lipid breakdown and release of fatty acids into the blood. The fatty acids enter myocytes, where they accumulate in small lipid droplets. This ectopic lipid storage in muscle somehow causes insulin resistance, perhaps by triggering lipid-activated protein kinases that inactivate some element in the insulin-signaling pathway. GLUT4 glucose transporters leave the myocyte surface, preventing glucose entry into muscle; the myocyte has now become insulin-resistant. It cannot use blood glucose for its fuel, so fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue and become the primary fuel. The increased influx of fatty acids into muscle leads to further deposition of ectopic lipids. In some individuals, insulin resistance develops into type 2 diabetes. [Information from A.

Stage 2: A box labeled overweight contains text reading, T A G subscript diet end subscript is greater than T A G subscript catabolized end subscript. A vertical fusiform muscle contains a mitochondrion with an arrow pointing to show that it produces an orange oval labeled A T P. Glucose outside of the muscle has a blue arrow pointing into the muscle. A clump of larger yellow spheres is labeled larger adipocytes. An arrow labeled fatty acids points from the adipocytes to the muscle. Stage 3: A box labeled pro-inflammatory state contains text reading, enlarged adipocytes produce monocyte chemotaxis protein (M C P – 1. The illustration is similar except that the adipocytes are labeled M C P -1 with arrows pointing in all directions. The arrow labeled fatty acids pointing from the adipocytes to the muscle is brown on top and thicker. Stages 1 through 3 are all linked by a bracket reading, Insulin-sensitive muscle with normal glucose transport. Stage 4: A box labeled chronic inflammation contains text reading, Macrophages infiltrate adipose tissue in response to M C P-1. A similar figure is shown that includes elements of stages 4 through 7. There are brown rosettes in the adipocytes with arrows pointing toward T N F alpha in the center. A thick red arrow labeled fatty acids points from the adipocytes to the muscle, indicating both the mitochondrion and a group of yellow spheres near the top. Glucose has a blue arrow pointing toward the muscle, but it bends instead of entering the muscle. This stage is labeled, Insulin-resistant muscle with reduced glucose transport. Stage 5: Macrophages in adipose tissue produce T N F alpha, which favors export of fatty acids. Stage 6: Adipocytes export fatty acids to muscle where ectopic deposits form. A line points to the yellow spheres in the top half of the muscle. Stage 7: Ectopic lipid interferes with G L U T 4 movement to the myocyte surface, producing insulin resistance.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_fj3ZMpmRS0">According to this hypothesis, excess stored fatty acids and TAGs are toxic to liver and muscle. Some individuals are less well equipped genetically to handle this burden of ectopic lipids and are more susceptible to the cellular damage that leads to development of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance probably involves impairment of several of the mechanisms by which insulin acts on metabolism, which include changes in protein levels and changes in the activities of signaling enzymes and transcription factors. For example, both adiponectin synthesis in adipocytes and adiponectin levels in the blood decrease with obesity and increase with weight loss.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eORtUl5xHR">There are genetic factors that predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes. Although 80% of people with type 2 diabetes are obese, most obese individuals do not develop type 2 diabetes. Given the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms we have discussed in this chapter, it is not surprising that the genetics of diabetes is complex, involving interactions among variant genes and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle. A growing number of genetic loci have been reliably linked to type 2 diabetes; variation in any of these “diabetogenes” alone would cause a relatively small increase in the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_hK89RPpIQ1" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_14_pg523.png"/></p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_HMLJIUIjIu">In cases of extreme obesity, dramatic weight loss can be achieved by bariatric surgery, which reroutes food movement through the stomach and small intestine. In many cases, this procedure also moderates or even reverses type 2 diabetes. In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP, named for César Roux, the Swiss surgeon who developed the procedure), the stomach is reduced to a small pouch attached to the esophagus, and the middle region of the small intestine (the jejunum) is attached directly to the pouch. Food bypasses most of the stomach and the duodenum, and goes primarily to the “Roux limb” of the intestine. Stomach acid and digestive enzymes travel through bypassed portions of the gut to join the food in the common channel. People who undergo RYGBP surgery not only experience dramatic weight loss but also are less hungry. Remarkably, this surgery also reverses type 2 diabetes in many cases. The explanations for these effects are likely to lie in altered communication among the gut, the brain, and other organs. This may result from changes in the kind and amount of peptide hormones (such as GLP-1 and <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_Az0XZwhkZF" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathalttext" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>PYY</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>–</mo><mn>36</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="PYY Subscript 3 en-dash 36" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch23_06EQ_0006.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>) secreted in the intestine that signal satiety and inhibit feeding behavior.
