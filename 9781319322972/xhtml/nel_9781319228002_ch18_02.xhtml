Across the top, three dark brown boxes are shown with arrows pointing into the brown rectangle. The left-hand box reads, glutamine from muscle and other tissues. An arrow points down to glutamine, shown as a five-carbon vertical chain. Numbered from top to bottom, C 1 forms C O O minus, C 2 is bonded to N H 3 plus to the left and to H to the right, C 3 and C 4 are each bonded to 2 H, and C 5 is bonded to O to the lower left and bonded to N H 2 in a beige box to the lower right. Two arrows point away from glutamine. To the right, an arrow points to glutamate, which is bolded, inside a darker brown box. Glutamate is a similar structure in which the N H 3 plus bonded to C 2 is enclosed in a light brown box and C 5 forms C O O minus. From glutamine, the second arrow curves down to the right to a beige box labeled N H 4 plus from which an arrow points out of the brown rectangle, through the membrane, to a brown box labeled N H 4 plus, urea, or uric acid. From glutamate, at arrow points down to the same N H 4 plus in a box, but an arrow branches from this downward arrow to alpha-ketoglutarate to the right. Alpha-ketoglutarate has C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 double bonded to O, C 3 and C 4 bonded to 2 H, and C 5 forming C O O minus. An arrow points left from alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate and meets an arrow that comes down from a molecule above, an amino acid from ingested protein, and then curves up to yield alpha-keto acids, shown as a vertical molecule with C 1 at the top forming C O O minus, C 2 double bonded to O, and R below. Above the brown molecule, the central brown box is labeled amino acids from ingested protein and has an arrow pointing into the brown rectangle to indicate an amino acid shown as a central C bonded to C O O minus above, H to the right, R below, and a beige box labeled N H 3 plus to the left. Arrows point to the left and right between this amino acid and cellular protein to the left, indicating a reversible reaction. Two single arrows point away from the amino acid. One arrow points left from R of the amino acid above text reading (glutamate), then curves down to indicate the same molecule of glutamate in dark brown box that was also produced from glutamine. The second arrow points down to meet the horizontal arrow pointing left from alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate before curving up to indicate alpha-keto acids. The right-hand box above the brown rectangle is labeled alanine from muscle and has an arrow pointing into a molecule within the brown box. This molecule has a central C bonded to C O O minus above, H to the right, C H 3 below, and N H 3 plus to the left with a beige box around N plus. An arrow points down from this molecule, then curves left near the bottom of the brown rectangle before bending upward to point to glutamate. About halfway down the vertical part of this arrow, an arrow curves in from alpha-ketoglutarate on the left and then immediately curves right to indicate that pyruvate is produced. Pyruvate is shown as a three-carbon chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 double bonded to O, and C 3 bonded to 3 H. Part b shows the structures of three molecules in which all N atoms are highlighted in red. Each structure has a gray text box beneath. Ammonia (as ammonium ion): N H 4 plus. The accompanying text box reads, Ammonotelic animals: most aquatic vertebrates, such as bony fishes and the larvae of amphibians. Urea: A central C is bonded to N H 2 to the left and right and double bonded to O below. The accompanying text box reads, Ureotelic animals: many terrestrial vertebrates; also sharks. Uric acid: A double-ring structure has a six-membered ring on the left that shares a double bond at its right side with a five-membered ring to its right. The left-hand six-membered ring has C at the top and lower left vertices double bonded to O and N substituted for C and further bonded to H at the upper left and bottom vertices. The right-hand five-membered ring has C double bonded to O at its right side vertex and N substituted for C and further bonded to H at its upper and lower right vertices. The accompanying text box reads, Uricoteloic animals: birds, reptiles.</p>

Excess ammonia generated in most other tissues is converted to the amide nitrogen of glutamine, which passes to the liver, then into liver mitochondria. Glutamine or glutamate or both are present in higher concentrations than other amino acids in most tissues. In skeletal muscle, excess amino groups are generally transferred to pyruvate to form alanine, another important molecule in the transport of amino groups to the liver. We begin with a discussion of the breakdown of dietary proteins, then proceed to a general description of the metabolic fates of amino groups.</p>

Part of the esophagus shown as a tube running vertically down before bending right to narrow as it joins the stomach, which is curved sac with a ridged texture that has a rounded portion that extends above the point of entry of the esophagus and that narrows as it curves to the left at the bottom to join the small intestine. There is tissue within the place where stomach and small intestine meet, forming a narrow passageway, then the opening widens. The small intestine curves down vertically and is labeled p H 7, then curves around the rounded left side of the pancreas before bending upward along the right side of the pancreas. In this region, the small intestine contains text reading zymogens with an arrow pointing right to active proteases. The small intestine then bends and extends vertically downward. The pancreas is a yellow structure containing many irregular oblongs that fits into the rounded portion of the small intestine to the left, then narrows as it extends to the right behind and beneath the stomach and above the small intestine before tapering to a narrow tip. At the left end of the pancreas, a darker line labeled pancreatic duct extends diagonally up to the right to run behind the stomach. Smaller, similar lines extend diagonally above and below it. Part a shows a close-up of a small piece of tissue from the top wall of the stomach labeled gastric glands in stomach lining. It is a vertical rectangular structure with a dark rectangular layer on top above a lighter rectangular layer. The tissue below is yellowish. The bottom boundary has individual cells shown. This boundary begins at the lower left and bends vertically upward, curves sharply, then bends downward again to form a narrow opening. A similar but wider and taller opening is to its right, extending almost to the two rectangular layers at the top. Above the left-hand opening and to the left of the top of the second, taller opening, there is a small, narrow oval with cells shown around its outer boundary. Two of the cells in this oval, one at the middle of the left side and one at the lower right, are colored light blue to represent parietal cells (secrete H C l). Across the bottom side of the overall piece of tissue, the cells are all beige, which represents gastric mucosa (secretes gastrin). Most of the cells in the invaginations are pink, representing Chief cells (secrete pepsinogen), but some blue cells are present. In the middle, there is a short invagination that is wider at the top beneath a wider oval. To its right, there is a longer narrow invagination slightly taller than the second one from the left. A short invagination is at the corner of the overall rectangle of tissue, then a medium height invagination is visible to its right, around the side, with a wider top portion just beneath a circular opening near the bottom rectangular layer. Part b, exocrine cells of pancreas, shows a close-up of a piece of the right side of the pancreas. It shows a yellow circle that has a narrow, tubular opening to its left with an arrow pointing outward. The circle is lined by six individual cells that are wider against the circle and narrower toward an opening in the center of the circle. From the side near the outer boundary of the circle to the center, each cell has a purple oval, then some wavy lines labeled rough E R, then multiple green spheres labeled zymogen granules. The second cell from the left, at approximately the twelve o’clock position, has an invagination at its bottom containing green material like that contained in the zymogens. This green material extends into the central opening, where there is a fuzzy green patch to the right of a second fuzzy green patch near the entry to the tube extending to the left. The open region where these fuzzy green patches approach the tube is labeled collecting duct. Part c, labeled villi of small intestine, shows a close-up of a piece of the lower wall of the small intestine beneath the pancreas. It is roughly rectangular with a dark brown rectangular layer at the bottom containing red, slightly wavy horizontal lines. The interior tissue is yellowish brown. Beginning slightly above the brown layer, there are long vertical protrusions. Part of a protrusion is visible at the left side, then a full protrusion is visible in the middle, then another protrusion is visible at the right corner, and finally a partial protrusion is visible to the rear right. Each protrusion, labeled a villus, is a narrow vertical structure with a yellowish brown interior and with many cells visible in the pinkish outer boundary, labeled intestinal mucosa (absorbs amino acids).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_m7rkL6RzRx">A yellow bar at the top of the figure is labeled “A” at the upper left. An L-amino acid, shown as a central C in a light red box bonded to H above, C O O minus to the right, N H 3 plus below, and R to the left, is added to pyridoxal phosphate (internal aldimine form, on enzyme). Pyridoxal phosphate is shown as a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left side, upper right side, and lower right side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex bonded to C H double bonded to N plus H to the upper left further bonded to L y s to its lower left further bonded to a blue oval labeled E n z to its lower left. From this point, a series of reactions extend to the right with step 1 and an additional series of reactions labeled C extends diagonally downward and to the right. The series of reactions in part A are as follows. Step 1: Formation of external aldimine with substrate. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. This yields a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left side, upper right side, and lower right side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex bonded to C H double bonded to N plus further bonded to H bonded to C above in a light red bond bonded to C O O minus to the right, H above, and R to the left. This is labeled Schiff base intermediate (external aldimine). A red arrow points from B further bonded to the left and with a red pair of electrons to H at the top of the molecule, bonded to C in a light red box. Red arrows also point from the bond between this H and C in a light red box to the bond between C in a light red box and N H plus below, from the double bond between N H plus and C H to the bond between C H and C at the top vertex of the ring, from the double bond at the upper left side of the ring to the right side of the ring, and from the double bond at the lower right side of the ring to N plus at the bottom vertex of the ring. From this point, this series of reactions continues to the right with step 2 and an additional series of reactions, labeled B, extends diagonally downward and to the right. Step 2: Abstraction of proton, leading to quinonoid formation. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. This yields a quinonoid intermediate, shown as a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left and right sides; an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N with a red pair of electrons substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; the top vertex double bonded to C H above bonded to N H with a positive charge on N further bonded to C in a light red box bonded to C O O minus to the right and R to the left. Red arrows point from the double bond between the upper vertex of the ring and C H to H plus to the right, from the right side bond of the ring to the upper right side of the ring, and from the pair of electrons on N at the bottom vertex to the lower right side of the ring. Step 3: Rearrangement. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. This yields a six-membered ring with double bonds at the upper right side, lower right side, and left side; with the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled C; with N plus at the bottom vertex further bonded to H; with the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; with the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and with the upper vertex bonded to C H 2 further bonded to N H with a positive charge on N and further double bonded to C in a light red box bonded to C O O minus to the right and bonded to R to the left. Step 4: Hydrolysis of Schiff base to form alpha-keto acid and pyridoxamine. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. H 2 O is added to the right-pointing arrow. This yields an alpha-keto acid and pyridoxamine phosphate. The alpha-keto acid is shown as a red highlighted C bonded to C O O to the right, bonded to R to the left, and double bonded to O below. Pyridoxamine phosphate is shown as a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left side, upper right side, and lower right side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to N H 3 plus. From the Schiff base intermediate (external aldimine) produced by step 2, arrows pointing diagonally to the lower right and back indicate a reversible reaction labeled B in a gray horizontal region. This yields quinonoid intermediate like the one in the previous series of reactions. The quinonoid intermediate is shown as a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left and right sides; an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N with a red pair of electrons substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; the top vertex double bonded to C H above bonded to N H with a positive charge on N further bonded to C in a light red box bonded to C O O minus to the right and R to the left. Red arrows point from the double bond between N H plus and C in a light red box to H plus to the left, from the double bond between C at the top vertex and C H above to the bond between the same C H and N H plus above, from the right side bond of the ring to the upper right bond of the ring, and from the pair of electrons on N to the lower right bond of the ring. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. This yields a six-membered ring with double bonds at the upper right side, lower right side, and left side; an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; the top vertex double bonded to C H above bonded to N H with a positive charge on N further bonded to C in a light red box bonded to C O O minus to the right, H to the left, and R above. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. A blue oval labeled E n z bonded to L y s above further bonded to N H 3 plus to the right is added to the right-pointing arrow. This yields a D-amino acid, shown as a central C in a light red bond bonded to C O O minus to the right, N H 3 plus below, H to the left, and R above, and pyridoxal phosphate (internal aldimine form, on regenerated enzyme. From the original starting molecule, pyridoxal phosphate (internal aldimine form, on enzyme), arrows pointing diagonally to the lower right and back indicate a reversible reaction labeled C in a green horizontal region. This yields a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left side, upper right side, and lower right side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex bonded to C H double bonded to N plus further bonded to H bonded further bonded to C above in a light red bond bonded to C to the right double bonded to O to the upper right and bonded to O minus to the lower right, bonded o R to the left, and bonded to H above. This is labeled Schiff base intermediate (external aldimine). Red arrows point from the negative charge on O minus bonded to C further bonded to C in the light red box to the bond between the same O and C, from the bond between this C and C in the light red box to the bond between C in the light red bond and N H plus below, from the double bond between N H plus and C H below to the bond between the same C H and C at the top vertex of the ring, from the bond at the upper right side of the ring to the right side of the ring, and from the bond at the lower right side of the ring to N plus at the bottom vertex of the ring. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. An arrow branches from the right-pointing arrow to show the loss of C O 2. This yields a quinonoid intermediate, shown as a six-membered ring with double bonds at the right and left sides; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N with a red pair of electrons substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex double bonded to C H double bonded to N plus further bonded to H bonded further bonded to C above in a light red bond bonded to R to the left and H above. Red arrows point from the double bond between N plus and C in the light red box to H plus to the right, from the double bond between C at the upper right vertex and C H to the bond between the same C H and N plus, from the right side double bond to the upper right side, and from the pair of electrons on N at the bottom vertex to the lower right side. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. This yields a six-membered ring with double bonds at the upper right side, lower right side, and left side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex double bonded to C H double bonded to N plus further bonded to H bonded further bonded to C above in a light red bond bonded to R to the left, H above, and H to the right. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that this is a reversible reaction. A blue oval labeled E n z bonded to L y s above further bonded to N H 3 plus to the right is added to the right-pointing arrow. This yields an amine, shown as a central C in a light red box bonded to N H 3 plus below, R to the left, H above, and H above, plus pyridoxal phosphate (internal aldimine form, on regenerated enzyme). To the left of this series of reactions, a carbanion is shown to the left of a quinoid intermediate with a double-headed arrow between them. These molecules are between brackets and text below reads, resonance structures for stabilization of a carbanion by P L P. The carbanion is a six-membered ring with double bonds at the upper right side, lower right side, and left side; the upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P; N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and further bonded to H; the lower left vertex bonded to C H 3; the upper left vertex bonded to O H; and the top vertex double bonded to C H connected by a double bond enclosed in a light red box to N plus further bonded to H and bonded to C above with a pair of electrons and a negative charge that is bonded to R to the left and H above. There is a light red box enclosing this C and the bond between it and N plus below. The quinoid intermediate is similar except that the top vertex of the ring is bonded to C H connected by a single bond in a light red box to N plus further bonded to H and connected by a double bond in a light red box to C in the same light red box further bonded to R on the left and H above.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Row3XpM2lU">Glutamine is the second major source of ammonia in hepatocyte mitochondria and is particularly important for intercellular transport of ammonia. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_7tImZHTmHo" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> Ammonia is quite toxic to animal tissues (we examine some possible reasons for this toxicity later). Significant amounts are present in blood, but the levels are tightly controlled. In many tissues, including the brain, some processes such as nucleotide degradation generate free ammonia. In most animals, much of the free ammonia is converted to a nontoxic compound before export from the extrahepatic tissues into the blood and transport to the liver or kidneys. For this transport function, glutamate, critical to <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_MmWRUYQjuP">intracellular</i> amino group metabolism, is supplanted by <span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_nJ4AjdGYA6">l</span>-glutamine.
