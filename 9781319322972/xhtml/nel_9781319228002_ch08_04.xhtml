The chemical transformations that do occur are generally very slow in the absence of an enzyme catalyst. The long-term storage of information without alteration is so important to a cell, however, that even very slow reactions that alter DNA structure can be physiologically significant. Processes such as carcinogenesis and aging may be intimately linked to slowly accumulating, irreversible alterations of DNA. Other, nondestructive alterations also occur and are essential to function, such as the strand separation that must precede DNA replication or transcription. In addition to providing insights into physiological processes, our understanding of nucleic acid chemistry has given us a powerful array of technologies that have applications in molecular biology, medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We now examine the chemical properties of DNA and a few of these technologies.</p>

However, if the two strands are completely separated, renaturation occurs in two steps. In the first, relatively slow step, the two strands “find” each other by random collisions and form a short segment of complementary double helix. The second step is much faster: the remaining unpaired bases successively come into register as base pairs, and the two strands “zipper” themselves together to form the double helix.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_BY94NoQ4Wm">The most important source of mutagenic alterations in DNA is oxidative damage. Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radicals arise during irradiation or (more commonly) as a byproduct of aerobic metabolism. These species damage DNA through any of a large, complex group of reactions, ranging from oxidation of deoxyribose and base moieties to strand breaks. Of these species, the hydroxyl radicals are responsible for most oxidative DNA damage. Cells have an elaborate defense system to destroy reactive oxygen species, including enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase that convert reactive oxygen species to harmless products. A fraction of these oxidants inevitably escape cellular defenses, however, and are able to damage DNA. Accurate estimates for the extent of this damage are not yet available, but every day the DNA of each human cell is subjected to thousands of damaging oxidative reactions.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_7WfqsyJIVs">An important practical advance in nucleic acid chemistry was the rapid and accurate synthesis of short oligonucleotides of known sequence. The methods were pioneered by H. Gobind Khorana and his colleagues in the 1970s. Refinements by Robert Letsinger and Marvin Caruthers led to the chemistry now in widest use, called the phosphoramidite method (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_qyDtDWWCEe"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_B3Q5kIT240" id="dav_9781319322342_GWrifeDT7A">Fig. 8-32</a></strong>). The synthesis is carried out with the growing strand attached to a solid support, using principles similar to those used by Merrifield for peptide synthesis (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zHu7CHLMYg" id="dav_9781319322342_FMrApuPqlA">Fig. 3-30</a>), and is readily automated. The efficiency of each addition step is very high, allowing the routine synthesis of polymers containing 70 or 80 nucleotides and, in some laboratories, much longer strands. The availability of relatively inexpensive DNA polymers with predesigned sequences revolutionized all areas of biochemistry.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_3R4O81TD2M">The PCR procedure has an elegant simplicity. Basic PCR requires four components: a DNA sample containing the segment to be amplified, the pair of synthetic oligonucleotide primers, a pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and a DNA polymerase. There are three steps (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gEU06mzpAL" id="dav_9781319322342_HMCa3qcyRo">Fig. 8-33</a>). In step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_eUlX2TbtZt" role="presentation" src="../images/1a.png"/>, the reaction mixture is heated briefly to denature the DNA, separating the two strands. In step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_E4hcqeKtGW" role="presentation" src="../images/2.png"/>, the mixture is cooled so that the primers can anneal to the DNA. The high concentration of primers increases the likelihood that they will anneal to each strand of the denatured DNA before the two DNA strands (present at a much lower concentration) can reanneal to each other. Then, in step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_aHtGxHNvDd" role="presentation" src="../images/3.png"/>, the primed segment is replicated selectively by the DNA polymerase, using the pool of dNTPs. The cycle of heating, cooling, and replication is repeated 25 to 30 times over a few hours in an automated process, amplifying the DNA segment between the primers until the sample is large enough to be readily analyzed or cloned (described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_iNKSWEBZuH" id="dav_9781319322342_uXCUXJ5HlP">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_p0e9Id5Zkp">Each replication cycle doubles the number of target DNA segment copies, so the concentration grows exponentially.

The double-helical structure of DNA is highly stable, but as we have seen, DNA does degrade slowly over time through various nonenzymatic reactions. PCR has allowed the successful cloning of rare, undegraded DNA segments isolated from samples more than 40,000 years old. Investigators have used the technique to clone DNA <span aria-label="286" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page286" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fragments from the mummified remains of humans and extinct animals, such as the woolly mammoth, creating the research fields of molecular archaeology and molecular paleontology.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_NAh3LQwf7b">One of the most accurate methods for placing an individual at the scene of a crime is a fingerprint. But with the advent of recombinant DNA technology (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_iNKSWEBZuH" id="dav_9781319322342_PhGhS9w1Pu">Chapter 9</a>), a much more powerful tool became available: <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_C1vcdnUwWc">DNA genotyping</strong> (also called DNA fingerprinting or DNA profiling). As first described by English geneticist Alec Jeffreys in 1985, the method is based on <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_4rbZKGA5g3"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_EdNuatLYSF" id="dav_9781319322342_cnYdDulWo5" role="doc-glossref">sequence polymorphisms</a></dfn>, slight sequence differences among individuals — 1 in every 1,000 bp, on average. Each difference from the prototype human genome sequence (the first human genome that was sequenced) occurs in some fraction of the human population; every person has some differences from this prototype.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_hj5gNlFFqX">Forensic work focuses on differences in the lengths of <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_wzTvGXFh7M"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_yw60TMajQ5" id="dav_9781319322342_90llROCR9i" role="doc-glossref">short tandem repeat (STR)</a></dfn> sequences. An STR locus is a specific location on a chromosome where a short DNA sequence (usually 4 bp long) is repeated many times in tandem. The loci most often used in STR genotyping are short — 4 to 50 repeats (16 to 200 bp for tetranucleotide repeats) — and have multiple length variants in the human population. More than 20,000 tetranucleotide STR loci have been characterized in the human genome. And more than a million STRs of all types may be present in the human genome, accounting for about 3% of all human DNA.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_CxIqulWvLY">The length of a particular STR in a given individual can be determined with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gEU06mzpAL" id="dav_9781319322342_AufT7c437f">Fig. 8-33</a>). The use of PCR also makes the procedure sensitive enough to be applied to the very small samples often collected at crime scenes. The DNA sequences flanking STRs are unique to each STR locus and are identical (except for very rare mutations) in all humans. PCR primers are targeted to this flanking DNA and are designed to amplify the DNA across the STR (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_oDpbwQxjYz"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_BK6IMek2Ne" id="dav_9781319322342_jn6HUyr3AV">Fig. 1a</a></strong>). The length of the PCR product then reflects the length of the STR in that sample. Because each human inherits one chromosome of each chromosome pair from each parent, the STR lengths on the two chromosomes are often different, generating two different STR lengths from one individual.</p>

(b) The PCR products from amplification of up to 16 STR loci can be run on a single capillary acrylamide gel (a “16-plex” analysis). Determination of which locus corresponds to which signal depends on the color of the fluorescent dye attached to the primers used in the process and on the size range in which the signal appears (the size range can be controlled by which sequences — those closer to or more distant from the STR — are targeted by the designed PCR primers).

The resulting bands are converted into a set of peaks that accurately reveal the size of each PCR fragment and thus the length of the STR in the corresponding allele. Analysis of multiple STR loci can yield a profile that is unique to an individual (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_BK6IMek2Ne" id="dav_9781319322342_E5XwtWNyPQ">Fig. 1b</a>). This is typically done with a commercially available kit that includes PCR primers unique to each locus, linked to colored dyes to help distinguish the different PCR products. PCR amplification enables investigators to obtain STR genotypes from less than 1 ng of partially degraded DNA, an amount that can be obtained from a single hair follicle, a small fraction of a drop of blood, a small semen sample, or samples that might be months or even many years old. When good STR genotypes are obtained, the chance of misidentification is less than 1 in <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_TqWzq3ppu3" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>18</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="10 Superscript 18" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch08_04EQ_0039.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> (a quintillion).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_RztAPORh7m">The successful forensic use of STR analysis required standardization, first attempted in the United Kingdom in 1995. The U.S. standard, called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), established in 1998, was originally based on 13 well-studied STR loci. These continue to be required in any DNA-typing experiment carried out in the United States (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_M2qYvJqM9a" id="dav_9781319322342_PNw00dYZlX">Table 1</a>) and are also used internationally. The amelogenin gene is also used as a marker in the analyses. Present on the human sex chromosomes, this gene has a slightly different length on the X and Y chromosomes. PCR amplification across this gene thus generates different-sized products that can reveal the sex of the DNA donor. By mid-2019, the CODIS database contained more than 18 million STR genotypes and had assisted in nearly 500,000 forensic investigations. As the CODIS database has expanded, the chance for adventitious matches has increased. The CODIS standard was expanded in 2017 to include 20 core loci. The new loci were incorporated with international agreement to ensure compatibility. Loci utilized in commercial kits have since expanded from 16 to 24.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8vbEVG1JqD">DNA genotyping has been used to both convict and acquit suspects, and to establish paternity with an extraordinary degree of certainty. In the United States, there have been many hundreds of postconviction exonerations based on DNA evidence. The impact of these procedures on court cases will continue to grow as standards are refined and as international STR genotyping databases grow. Even very old mysteries can be solved. In 1996, STR genotyping helped confirm identification of the bones of the last Russian czar and his family, who were assassinated in 1918.</p>

The bottom strand is labeled template strand and begins with its 3 prime end on the left. Sets of three horizontal lines represent hydrogen bonds between bases, and there are three such bonds between each G C pair and two between each A T pair. The top strand has alternating circles representing phosphates and five-membered rings with one- or two-ringed bases extending downward. The bottom strand is similar except that the bases extend up from the backbone. From left to right, the bases on top are G, A, T, T, and C with G in the process of being added. From left to right, the bottom strand has C, T, A, A, G, C, T, C, G, A, C, and T. The G in the process of being added has formed three hydrogen bonds with C on the bottom strand and has a five-membered ring above with O H bonded to its upper right vertex and C H 2 bonded to its upper right vertex and further bonded to a chain of three P. The sugar to the left of this phosphate chain has O H bonded to its upper right vertex, and there is an arrow from a pair of highlighted electrons on the O to the first P of the three-phosphate chain. A second arrow points from the bond between this P and the second P in the chain to the second P. The structure with G, a sugar, and three P is labeled lowercase d uppercase G uppercase T uppercase P. To the right, a similar structure is shown that has A instead of G and a red highlighted H instead of O H boded to the upper right vertex of the sugar ring. This structure is labeled lowercase d lowercase d uppercase A uppercase T uppercase P. Text reads, lowercase d lowercase d uppercase A uppercase T uppercase P terminates synthesis because 3 prime H cannot act as nucleophile in phosphodiester bond formation. Part b shows a molecule with a base, a five-membered sugar ring, and a chain of three phosphates. The five-membered ring has O at the top vertex between C 4 prime and C 1 prime, C 1 prime bonded to a base above the ring, C 2 prime bonded to H below the ring, C 3 prime bonded to red highlighted H below the ring, C 4 prime bonded to C 5 prime above the ring that is further bonded to 2 H and a chain of three phosphates. Part c shows a rectangle labeled autoradiograph of electrophoresis gel. On the left, it is numbered from 12 to 1 from top to bottom. On the right, it is labeled from top to bottom as 3 prime A G T C G A G C T T A G t prime. Text below the right side reads, sequence of complementary strand. Across the top of the gel from left to right, the lanes are labeled A, C, G, T. There are bands in the lanes as follows: A 12, 7, 2; C 9, 5; G 11, 8, 6, 1; T 10, 4, 3. A box above the gel shows two bars. The top bar is labeled on the left as primer 5 prime star and has O H extending from the right side. The bottom bar is labeled on the left as template 3 prime and has a strand extending from the right side that reads, C T A A G C T C G A C T. This is added to lowercase d uppercase A uppercase T uppercase P, lowercase d uppercase C uppercase T uppercase P, lowercase d uppercase G uppercase T uppercase P, and lowercase d uppercase T uppercase T uppercase P. Four arrows point down from this box.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_C5VTURtCal">Sanger sequencing exploited new (at the time) information about the mechanism of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase to distinguish between the four nucleotides, making use of nucleotide analogs called dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) to interrupt synthesis specifically at one or another type of nucleotide. Like PCR, Sanger’s method makes use of DNA polymerases and a primer to synthesize a DNA strand complementary to the strand under analysis. Each added deoxynucleotide is complementary, through base pairing, to a base in the template strand.

Once a ddNTP is added to a growing strand, that strand cannot be extended further.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_vD9YaRSq5w">For instance, to identify C residues, a small amount of ddCTP is added to a reaction system containing a much larger amount of dCTP (along with the other three dNTPs). A competition then occurs every time the DNA polymerase encounters a G in the template strand. Usually, dC is added, and synthesis of the strand continues. Sometimes, ddC will be added instead, and the strand will be terminated at that position. Thus, a small fraction of the synthesized strands are prematurely terminated at every position where dC would normally be added, opposite each template dG. Given the excess of dCTP over ddCTP, the chance that the analog will be incorporated instead of dC is small. But enough ddCTP is present to ensure that some of the strands will be terminated at each G residue in the template.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_b2ZF03P3ev">The result is a solution containing a mixture of fragments, each ending with a ddC residue. The fragments differ in length, and locating the C residues then relies on precise electrophoretic methods that allow separation of DNA strands differing in size by only one nucleotide residue. (See <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_lOiBM4Q2Y7" id="dav_9781319322342_y6RlF9eRVS">Fig. 3-18</a> for a description of gel electrophoresis.)

The DNA sequence is read by identifying the color sequences in the bands as they pass the detector and feeding this information directly to a computer.

With modest expense, a personal genomic sequence can be routinely included in each individual’s medical record. These advances have been made possible by methods sometimes referred to as next-generation, or “next-gen,” sequencing. The sequencing strategies have some similarities to the Sanger method. Innovations have allowed a miniaturization of the procedure, a massive increase in scale, and a corresponding decrease in cost. Two widely used approaches, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_rxd8mdNsTm"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Uo0Vza1sqC" id="dav_9781319322342_xAkqmEM3Zl" role="doc-glossref">reversible terminator sequencing</a></dfn> and <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_OFmF4pNIx3"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Mrax7SZKgI" id="dav_9781319322342_pE0t2M9BWY" role="doc-glossref">single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing</a></dfn>, both developed commercially, are described.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4e4j86nYqb">In both approaches, large genomes are sequenced by first collecting the DNA from many cells of the organism or individual. The DNA is sheared at random locations to generate fragments of a particular average size. The individual fragments — many with overlapping sequences — are immobilized on a solid support, and each is sequenced in place. Fluorescent dyes linked to the nucleotides and powerful optical systems that can detect incorporation of each new nucleotide by DNA polymerase allow the sequencing process to be monitored directly. The fluorescent dyes and the design of the methods solve both problems in DNA sequencing at <span aria-label="291" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page291" role="doc-pagebreak"/>once, identifying each nucleotide and fixing its location in the large sequence. Individual regions of a genome may be sequenced hundreds, even thousands, of times. The entire genomic sequence is reconstructed by computer programs that align the sequences of overlapping fragments.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AxWB6lK8Dx">In the reversible terminator sequencing method developed by Illumina, the genomic DNA to be sequenced is sheared so as to generate fragments a few hundred base pairs long. Synthetic oligonucleotides of known sequence are ligated to each end of each fragment, providing a point of reference on every DNA molecule. The individual fragments are then immobilized on a solid surface, and each is amplified in place by PCR to form a tight cluster of identical fragments. The solid surface is part of a channel on a flow cell that allows liquid solutions to stream over the samples. The result is a solid surface just a few centimeters wide with millions of attached DNA clusters, each cluster containing multiple copies of a single DNA sequence derived from a random genomic DNA fragment. To provide a starting point for DNA polymerase, an oligonucleotide primer is then added that is complementary to the oligonucleotides of known sequence ligated to the various fragment ends. All of these millions of clusters are sequenced at the same time, with the data from each cluster captured and stored by a computer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZEuqwsarYa">The actual sequencing of each cluster employs reversible terminator sequencing (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_4KHAQ9aC6y"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vwzQHqpVkw" id="dav_9781319322342_BpRV2shYXg">Fig. 8-36</a></strong>). Four different modified deoxynucleotides (A, T, G, and C), each with a particular fluorescent label that identifies the nucleotide by color, are added to the sequencing reaction, along with the DNA polymerase. The labeled nucleotides also incorporate blocking groups attached to their <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_BBxYzZjeng" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo>′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="3 prime" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch08_04EQ_0056.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> ends that permit only one nucleotide to be added to each strand. The polymerase adds the appropriate nucleotide to the strands in each cluster, giving each cluster a color that corresponds to the added nucleotide. Next, lasers excite all the fluorescent labels, and an image of the entire surface reveals the color (and thus the identity) of the base added to each cluster. The fluorescent label and the blocking groups are then chemically or photolytically removed. The surface goes dark until the solution with labeled nucleotides and DNA polymerase is again introduced to the surface, allowing the next nucleotide to be added to each cluster. The sequencing proceeds stepwise. Read lengths obtained with this technology (that is, the length of individual DNA sequences that can be accurately determined) are typically 100 to 300 nucleotides. Read length is limited by constraints on cluster density on the flow cell surface and by small inefficiencies in the PCR reactions needed to amplify each cluster accurately. Accuracy is high, with error rates as low as 0.1%.</p>

Attenuated light from an excitation beam penetrates only the lower 20 to 30 nm in each pore, producing a light volume small enough to accommodate just one DNA polymerase molecule (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZDibpXfJ08" id="dav_9781319322342_i4X0LhgcCN">Fig. 8-37a</a>). A single DNA polymerase is immobilized at the bottom of each pore. Genomic DNA is sheared to generate random fragments that are tens of thousands of base pairs in length. Hairpin oligonucleotides are ligated to both ends of each fragment, so that the two DNA strands are joined in one continuous circle (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZDibpXfJ08" id="dav_9781319322342_rGYS4bKn9R">Fig. 8-37b</a>). A primer is annealed to the open single-stranded DNA at one end of the fragment, and this is captured by a DNA polymerase in one of the pores to initiate DNA synthesis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_5WRbhNkhkf">Fluorescent nucleotides are introduced, with A, T, G, and C each having a specific colored dye attached to the triphosphate. When a nucleotide binds to the DNA polymerase in the pore, it is immobilized long enough to produce a brief fluorescent light pulse that can be read by a detector (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZDibpXfJ08" id="dav_9781319322342_Byhl8WdMsL">Fig. 8-37c</a>). The fluorescent dye is released with the pyrophosphate as each new phosphodiester bond is formed. The error rate is high, about 10% to 15%. However, as the DNA template is a continuous circle, one DNA polymerase can replicate the same fragment over and over. The light pulses continue without interruption as new nucleotides are added in real time, and each pore thus generates a movie of light pulses (sometimes several hours long) that corresponds to the repeated sequencing of the DNA fragment bound in that pore. A computer program deletes the known sequences of the hairpin ends. Error is reduced by compiling a consensus sequence of the fragment by automated alignment of the many repeated sequencing passes and acceptance of the most common nucleotide signal detected at each position.</p>
