<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_r02FxAqw3K">The bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_kq0EunPh7c">Escherichia coli</i> produces more than 3,000 different proteins; a human has ~20,000 genes that may produce over a million different proteins (through genetic processes discussed in Part III of this text). In both species, each type of protein has a unique amino acid sequence that confers a particular three-dimensional structure. This structure in turn confers a unique function.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_P0hSMA9VZx">Amino acid sequences are important elements of the broader realm of biological information. They are a major functional expression of information stored in DNA in the form of genes. The sequences are not at all random. Each protein has a distinctive number and sequence of amino acid residues. As we shall see in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_h2H1GbPZdU" id="dav_9781319322342_J3nC5jOTp5">Chapter 4</a>, <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_CJrKGfaFqy" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> the primary structure of a protein determines how it folds up into its unique three-dimensional structure, and this in turn determines the function of the protein.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_xkjRO0iJsx">Some simple observations illustrate the functional importance of primary structure, or the amino acid sequence of a protein. First, as we have already noted, proteins with different functions always have different amino acid sequences. Second, thousands of human genetic diseases have been traced to the production of proteins with less activity or altered activity. The alteration can range from a single change in the amino acid sequence (as in sickle cell disease, described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch05_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_idIyOmduYS" id="dav_9781319322342_1575BQCX9L">Chapter 5</a>) to deletion of a larger portion of the polypeptide chain (as in most cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a large deletion in the gene encoding the protein dystrophin leads to production of a shortened, inactive protein). Finally, on comparing functionally similar proteins from different species, we find that these proteins often have similar amino acid sequences. Thus, a close link between protein primary structure and function is evident.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8wrB9F97M7">The amino acid sequence for a particular protein is not absolutely fixed, or invariant. Virtually all of the proteins in humans are <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_0441zYj5oE"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_HdfiBzeo9t" id="dav_9781319322342_AE1sE7cVJp" role="doc-glossref">polymorphic</a></dfn>, having amino acid sequence variants in the human population. Many human proteins are polymorphic even within an individual, with amino acid variations occurring due to processes that will be described in Part III of this text. Some of these variations have little or no effect on the function of the protein; others may affect function dramatically. Furthermore, proteins that carry out a broadly similar function in distantly related species can differ greatly in overall size and amino acid sequence.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_cM6f0BsiiI">Although the amino acid sequence in some regions of the primary structure might vary considerably without affecting biological function, most proteins contain crucial regions that are essential to their function and thus have sequences that are conserved. The fraction of the overall sequence that is critical varies from protein to protein, complicating the task of relating sequence to three-dimensional structure, and structure to function. Before we can consider this problem further, however, we must examine how sequence information is obtained.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qLxV6xAF6c">In 1953, Frederick Sanger worked out the sequence of amino acid residues in the polypeptide chains of the hormone insulin <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_6694K35yxB">(<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_76o6TGdB4w" id="dav_9781319322342_3OYWuNxpBy">Fig. 3-24</a>)</strong>, surprising many researchers who had long thought that determining the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide would be a hopelessly difficult task. The elucidation of DNA structure in that same year by Watson and Crick telegraphed a likely relationship between DNA and protein sequences. Barely a decade after these discoveries, the genetic code relating the nucleotide sequence of DNA to the amino acid sequence of protein molecules was elucidated (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_6BnfNoHGVH">Chapter 27</a>).</p>

A few chemical reagents also cleave the peptide bond adjacent to specific residues. Among proteases, the digestive enzyme trypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of only those peptide bonds in which the carbonyl group is contributed by either a Lys or an Arg residue, regardless of the length or amino acid sequence of the chain. A polypeptide with three Lys and/or Arg residues will usually yield four smaller peptides upon cleavage with trypsin. Moreover, all except one of these will have a carboxyl-terminal Lys or Arg.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_TcCD3f5r1W">The capacity to modify proteins in specific ways has many applications in the lab. The methods used to break disulfide bonds can also be used to denature proteins when that is required. The development of reagents to label the amino-terminal amino acid residue led eventually to the development of an array of reagents that could react with specific groups at many locations on a protein. For example, the sulfhydryl group on Cys residues can be modified with iodoacetamides, maleimides, benzyl halides, and bromomethyl ketones <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_aSzoayHXgi">(<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_EXxDajPLi5" id="dav_9781319322342_G2270eOgtu">Fig. 3-27</a>)</strong>. Other amino acid residues can be modified by reagents linked to a dye or other molecule to aid in protein detection or functional studies. The cleavage of proteins into smaller parts with proteases has numerous applications that will be explored in subsequent chapters of this book.</p>

In 1988, two different techniques were introduced to permit transfer of macromolecules to the gas phase while limiting decomposition; these new capabilities revolutionized protein sequencing. In one technique, proteins are placed in a light-absorbing matrix. With a short pulse of laser light, the proteins are ionized and then desorbed from the matrix into the vacuum system.

In a second method, macromolecules in solution are forced directly from the liquid phase to the gas phase. A solution of analytes is passed through a charged needle that is kept at a high electrical potential, dispersing the solution into a fine mist of charged microdroplets. The solvent surrounding the macromolecules rapidly evaporates, leaving multiply charged macromolecular ions in the gas phase. This technique is called <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_PFHgXfSoMW">electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</dfn>, or <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_1pi5eq6Unp">ESI MS</dfn>.

The arrow points into the center of this smaller structure, where two small, irregular, solid pieces are shown. A tubular protrusion extends from the right side of this structure and its end lines up with an opening in another large rectangle. An arrow points through the tubular protrusion and into the second large rectangle, which is labeled M S-2.

This process generates one or more sets of peaks. A given set of peaks (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Wb5D56NqwA" id="dav_9781319322342_af7X0LfxcC">Fig. 3-29b</a>) consists of all the charged fragments that were generated by breaking the same type of bond (but at different points in the peptide). One set of peaks includes only the fragments in which the charge was retained on the amino-terminal side of the broken bonds; another includes only the fragments in which the charge was retained on the carboxyl-terminal side of the broken bonds. Each successive peak in a given set has one less amino acid than the peak before. The difference in mass from peak to peak identifies the amino acid that was lost in each case, thus revealing the sequence of the peptide. The only ambiguities involve leucine and isoleucine, which have the same mass. Although multiple sets of peaks usually are generated, the two most prominent sets generally consist of charged fragments derived from breakage of the peptide bonds. The amino acid sequence derived from one set can be confirmed by the other, improving the confidence in the sequence information obtained.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_jCzGYv9bDG">The analysis of complex mixtures of proteins â even entire cellular proteomes â is facilitated by liquid chromatography (LC) that is integrated into the instrument (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Mz4mJYrdFO">LC-MS/MS</strong>). The organism of interest is generally one in which the genomic sequence is known. Cellular proteins are first isolated in an extract, then digested into relatively short peptides by a protease such as trypsin. The very complex mixture of peptides is subjected to chromatography, so that resolved peptides are introduced to the mass spectrometer successively. Transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase is facilitated by MALDI or ESI. Each peptide is analyzed for amino acid sequence, and that sequence is compared to the known genomic sequence available in databases to identify the protein it came from. Because more peptides are generated from the more common proteins in the mixture, the exercise also provides a measure of protein abundance. MS/MS scans of dozens of different peptides can be generated in less than a second. The entire proteome of a yeast cell can be analyzed in less than an hour.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ThM8p2KFKS">Mass spectrometry provides a wealth of information for proteomics research, enzymology, and protein chemistry in general. The accurately measured molecular mass of a protein is critical to its identification. Changes in the cellular proteome can be monitored as a function of metabolic state or environmental conditions. Mass changes in the peptides scanned during a proteome analysis can reveal protein modifications of all kinds. Amino acid sequencing can reveal changes in protein sequence that result from the editing of messenger RNA in eukaryotes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_1akbgXO6Am">Chapter 26</a>).

F m o c has three fused rings on the left with a five-membered ring that has a benzene ring fused to its upper left and lower left sides and that is further bonded from its right side vertex, which bonds to C H 2 that is further bonded to C that is double bonded to O above and bonded to N H of the amino acid residue on the right. This N H is bonded to C H that is bonded to R 1 above and to C on the right that is double bonded to O and single bonded to O minus. The reaction begins with a benzene ring that has C H 2 further bonded to C l extending left from its left side vertex and a spherical insoluble polystyrene bead extending from its right vertex. Step 1: Text reads, Carboxyl-terminal amino acid is attached to receive reactive group on resin. F m o c bonded to the amino acid residue is shown being added. Text reads, amino acid 1 with alpha-amino group protected by F m o c group. During this step, C l minus leaves. The product resembles the reactant except that C l has been replaced by F m o c bonded to the amino acid. The O minus on the right side of the amino acid has formed a bond to C H 2 extending from the left side vertex of the benzene ring bonded to the polystyrene bead. Step 2: Text reads, Protecting group is removed by flushing with solution containing a mild organic base. This produces a similar molecule in which F m o c has been removed and N H at the left side of the amino acid has become N H 3 plus. This molecule continues on to step 4, where it reacts with a molecule produced in step 3. The reactant entering step 3 is F m o c bonded to an amino acid residue similar to the previous amino acid residue except that it has R 2 in place of R 1 and is highlighted differently, with no highlight on O minus. Step 3: Text reads, Amino acid 2 with protected alpha-amino group is activated at carboxyl group by D C C. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (D C C) is added and is shown to consist of a hexagonal ring that has a bond from its right side carbon to N that is double bonded to C that is further double bonded to N that is further bonded to the left side vertex of a second hexagonal ring. The product resembles the reactant except that the O minus of the amino acid residue is now bonded to C between two N of D C C, which is the same except that one double bond from C to N has become a single bond with N becoming N H. Step 4: Text reads, Alpha-amino group of amino acid 1 attacks activated carboxyl group of amino acid 2 to form peptide bond. The product of step 3 is added to the product of step 2. A dicyclohexylurea byproduct is removed at this step. Its structure is similar to D C C, except that the central C is double bonded to O, both double bonds to N have been replaced by single bonds, and each N is now bonded to H. The product is similar to the product of step two with a benzene ring that has a polystyrene bead bonded to its right side vertex and a bond to C H 2 that is further bonded to amino acid residue 1 from its left side vertex. The N H 3 plus at the left side of the amino acid residue has become N H and is now bonded to the C of amino acid residue 2, which also has a double bond to O and is further bonded to the central carbon of its amino acid residue that is further bonded to F m o c. An arrow pointing back to the product of step 1 is accompanied by text reading, reactions 2 to 4 repeated as necessary. Step 5: Text reads, Completed peptide is deprotected as in reaction 2; T F A cleaves ester linage between peptide and resin. Trifluoracetic acid (T F A) is added at this step. The product is similar to the product of step 4 except that F m o c has left, the amino terminus of amino acid residue 1 is now N H 3 plus, the O minus of amino acid residue 2 is no longer bonded to C H 2 and has a negative charge, and the C H 2 bonded to the benzene ring that is bonded to the polystyrene bead is now bonded to F instead of to amino acid residue 1.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_FEJ31G3gyW">The technology for chemical peptide synthesis has been automated. An important limitation of the process is the efficiency of each chemical cycle. Incomplete reaction at one stage can lead to formation of an impurity (in the form of a shorter peptide) in the next. The chemistry has been optimized to permit the synthesis of proteins of 100 amino acid residues in a few days in reasonable yield. A very similar approach is used to synthesize nucleic acids (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gEU06mzpAL" id="dav_9781319322342_LMO6XWoOwQ">Fig. 8-33</a>). It is worth noting that this technology, impressive as it is, still pales when compared with biological processes. The same 100-residue protein would be synthesized with exquisite fidelity in about 5 seconds in a bacterial cell.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_PnakgrNG0l">Methods for the efficient ligation (joining together) of peptides allow the assembly of synthetic peptides into larger polypeptides and proteins. Novel forms of proteins can be created with precisely positioned chemical groups, including those that might not normally be found in a cellular protein. This provides one approach to test theories of enzyme catalysis, to create proteins with altered chemical properties, and to design protein sequences that will fold into particular structures. This last application provides the ultimate test of our ability to relate the primary structure of a peptide to the three-dimensional structure that it takes up in solution.</p>

Most of these insights are derived by searching for similarities between a protein of interest and previously studied proteins. Comparison of a newly obtained sequence with sequence data in international repositories often reveals relationships both surprising and enlightening.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_A9NFOOZ384">We do not understand in detail exactly how the amino acid sequence determines three-dimensional structure, nor can we always predict function from sequence. However, protein families that have some shared structural or functional features can be readily identified on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities. Individual proteins are assigned to families based on the degree of similarity in amino acid sequence. Members of a family are usually identical across 25% or more of their sequences, and proteins in these families generally share at least some structural and functional characteristics. Some families, however, are defined by identities involving only a few amino acid residues that are critical to a certain function. A number of similar substructures, or âdomainsâ (to be defined more fully in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_h2H1GbPZdU" id="dav_9781319322342_rgaHuwpynS">Chapter 4</a>), occur in many functionally unrelated proteins. These domains often fold into structural configurations that have an unusual degree of stability or that are specialized for a certain environment. Evolutionary relationships can also be inferred from the structural and functional similarities within protein families.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tBvqDFKF0f">Certain amino acid sequences serve as signals that determine the cellular location, chemical modification, and half-life of a protein. Special signal sequences, usually at the amino terminus, are used to target certain proteins for export from the cell; other proteins are targeted for distribution to the nucleus, the cell surface, the cytosol, or other cellular locations. Other sequences act as attachment sites for prosthetic groups, such as sugar groups in glycoproteins and lipids in lipoproteins. Some of these signals are well characterized and are easily recognized in the sequence of a newly characterized protein (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_gG3W9TIKyK">Chapter 27</a>).</p>

A position where any amino acid is allowed is designated x. Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids for a given position between square brackets. For example, in (a), [AG] means Ala or Gly. If all but a few amino acids are allowed at one position, the amino acids that are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_WLTNX9RlEW">not</i> allowed are listed between curly brackets. For example, in (b), {W} means any amino acid except Trp. Repetition of an element of the pattern is indicated by following that element with a number or range of numbers between parentheses. In (a), for example, x(4) means x-x-x-x; x(2,4) means x-x, or x-x-x, or x-x-x-x. When a pattern is restricted to either the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus of a sequence, that pattern starts with &lt; or ends with &gt;, respectively (not so for either example here). A period ends the pattern. Applying these rules to the consensus sequence in (a), either A or G can be found at the first position. Any amino acid can occupy the next four positions, followed by an invariant G and an invariant K. The last position is either S or T.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_weCHxJH3qk">Sequence logos provide a more informative and graphic representation of an amino acid (or nucleic acid) multiple sequence alignment. Each logo consists of a stack of symbols for each position in the sequence. The overall height of the stack (in bits) indicates the degree of sequence conservation at that position, whereas the height of each symbol (letter) in the stack indicates the relative frequency of that amino acid (or nucleotide). For amino acid sequences, the colors denote the characteristics of the amino acid: polar (G, S, T, Y, C, Q, N), green; basic (K, R, H), blue; acidic (D, E), red; and hydrophobic (A, V, L, I, P, W, F, M), black. The classification of amino acids in this scheme is somewhat different from the classification in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Quh2XjfsFy" id="dav_9781319322342_R587ZanU6V">Table 3-1</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gpxPh13orJ" id="dav_9781319322342_hrujooaOjp">Figure 3-5</a>. The amino acids with aromatic side chains are subsumed into the nonpolar (F, W) and polar (Y) classifications. Glycine, always hard to classify, is assigned to the polar group. Note that when multiple amino acids are acceptable at a particular position, they rarely occur with equal probability. One or a few usually predominate. The logo representation makes the predominance clear, and a conserved sequence in a protein is made obvious. However, the logo obscures some amino acid residues that may be allowed at a position, such as the Cys that occasionally occurs at position 8 of the EF hand in (b).</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_R5bkFEobpJ"><span aria-label="97" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page97" role="doc-pagebreak"/><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_B8WZAu5WV6" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> Each proteinâs function relies on its three-dimensional structure, which in turn is determined largely by its primary structure. Thus, the biochemical information conveyed by a protein sequence is limited only by our understanding of structural and functional principles. The constantly evolving tools of bioinformatics make it possible to identify functional segments in new proteins and also help to establish both their sequence and their structural relationships to proteins already in the databases. On a different level of inquiry, protein sequences <span aria-label="98" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" role="doc-pagebreak"/>are beginning to tell us how the proteins evolved and, ultimately, how life evolved on this planet.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pxTVwk1oyo">The field of molecular evolution is often traced to Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, whose work in the mid-1960s advanced the use of nucleotide and protein sequences to explore evolution. The premise is deceptively straightforward. If two organisms are closely related, the sequences of their genes and proteins should be similar. The sequences increasingly diverge as the evolutionary distance between two organisms increases. The promise of this approach began to be realized in the 1970s, when Carl Woese used ribosomal RNA sequences to define the Archaea as a group of living organisms distinct from the Bacteria and Eukarya. The information in genome and protein sequence databases can be used to trace biological history if we can learn to read the genetic hieroglyphics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LuOWGQQhnT">Evolution has not taken a simple linear path. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Tdvpwc1BvI" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> For a given protein, the amino acid residues essential for the activity of the protein are conserved over evolutionary time. The residues that are less important to function may vary over time â that is, one amino acid <span aria-label="99" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page99" role="doc-pagebreak"/>may substitute for another â and these variable residues can provide the information to trace evolution. Some proteins have more variable amino acid residues than others. For these and other reasons, different proteins evolve at different rates.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_yEaSNTLQnU">Another complicating factor in tracing evolutionary history is the rare transfer of a gene or a group of genes from one organism to another, a process called <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_dAdAxGUATk">horizontal gene transfer</dfn>. The transferred genes may be similar to the genes they were derived from in the original organism, whereas most other genes in the two organisms may be only distantly related. An example of horizontal gene transfer is the recent rapid spread of antibiotic-resistance genes in bacterial populations. The proteins derived from these transferred genes would not be good candidates for the study of bacterial evolution, because they share only a very limited evolutionary history with their âhostâ organisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eo8BNLB4ZT">The study of molecular evolution generally focuses on families of closely related proteins. In most cases, the families chosen for analysis have essential functions in cellular metabolism that must have been present in the earliest viable cells, thus greatly reducing the chance that they were introduced relatively recently by horizontal gene transfer. For example, a protein called EF-1<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_S0spqHTwIm">Î±</i> (elongation factor 1<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Fzt2fTAvrp">Î±</i>) is involved in the synthesis of proteins in all eukaryotes. A similar protein, EF-Tu, with the same function, is found in bacteria. Similarities in sequence and function indicate that EF-1<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_S0hK4J58FB">Î±</i> and EF-Tu are members of a family of proteins that share a common ancestor.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_S7M52L8gQS">Homologs are identified using computer programs that can directly compare specific protein sequences or that can search databases to identify any protein with an amino acid that matches within defined parameters. The electronic search process can be thought of as sliding one sequence past the other until a section with a good match is found. Within this sequence alignment, a positive score is assigned for each position where the two sequences are identical, and a negative score is introduced wherever gaps need to be introduced in one sequence or the other to bring them into register. The overall score provides a measure of the quality of the alignment <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_TqwQwlkRlA">(<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_p2kWrxNxAD" id="dav_9781319322342_XoHOUkkS1s">Fig. 3-31</a>)</strong>.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZoDgRxw91S">Finding identical amino acids is often inadequate in attempts to identify related proteins or, more importantly, to determine how closely related the proteins are on an evolutionary time scale. A more useful analysis also considers the chemical properties of substituted amino acids. Many of the amino acid differences within a protein family may be conservative â that is, an amino acid residue is replaced by a residue that has similar chemical properties. For example, a Glu residue may substitute in one family member for the Asp residue found in another; both amino acids are negatively charged. Logically, such a conservative substitution should receive a higher score in a sequence alignment than a nonconservative substitution does â for example, in replacement of the Asp residue with a hydrophobic Phe residue.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_k8e6hke4ou"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_lkM7BCr4PX" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> For most efforts to find homologies and explore evolutionary relationships, protein sequences are superior to nucleic acid sequences that do not encode a protein or functional RNA. For a nucleic acid, with its four different types of residues, random alignment of nonhomologous sequences will generally yield matches for at least 25% of the positions. Introduction of a few gaps can often increase the fraction of matched residues to 40% or more, and the probability of chance alignment of unrelated sequences becomes quite high. The 20 different amino acid residues in proteins greatly lower the probability of uninformative chance alignments of this type.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_MUpznK07KP">The programs used to generate a sequence alignment are complemented by methods that test the reliability of the alignments. A common computerized test is to shuffle the amino acid sequence of one of the proteins being compared in order to produce a random sequence, then to instruct the program to align the shuffled sequence with the other, unshuffled one. Scores are assigned to the new alignment, and the shuffling and alignment process is repeated many times. The <span aria-label="100" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page100" role="doc-pagebreak"/>original alignment, before shuffling, should have a score significantly higher than any of those within the distribution of scores generated by the random alignments; this increases the confidence that the sequence alignment has identified a pair of homologs. Note that the absence of a significant alignment score does not necessarily mean that no evolutionary relationship exists between two proteins. As we shall see in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_h2H1GbPZdU" id="dav_9781319322342_9yo4njMotI">Chapter 4</a>, three-dimensional structural similarities sometimes reveal evolutionary relationships where sequence homology has been wiped away by time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_D7LdUfb6eO">To use a protein family to explore evolution, researchers identify family members with similar molecular functions in the widest possible range of organisms. The sequence divergence in these protein families allows segregation of organisms into classes based on their evolutionary relationships.

From Patescibacteria at the 11 oâclock position, the names are written around the outside of the circle in that order and end with a small gap between Proteobacteria and Patescibacteria. There are concentric color-coded rings that are smallest in the center (with a larger gap on the left) and narrowest at the outermost ring. The Patescibacteria and Bacteroidetes are relatively small, the Actinobacteria is intermediate, the Firmicutes is large, and the Proteobacteria is very large. The branching is limited in the center but substantial along the outside, where there are lines extending all along the outer surface.</p>
