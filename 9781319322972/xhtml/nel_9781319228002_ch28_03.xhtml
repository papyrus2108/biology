<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_dSgW4kImUh">As in many other areas of biochemical investigation, the study of the regulation of gene expression advanced earlier and faster in bacteria than in other experimental organisms. The examples of bacterial gene regulation presented here are chosen from among scores of well-studied systems, partly for their historical significance, but primarily because they provide a good overview of the range of regulatory mechanisms in bacteria. Many of the principles of bacterial gene regulation are also relevant to understanding gene expression in eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nA9MTtUfzL">We begin by examining the lactose and tryptophan operons; each system has regulatory proteins, but the overall mechanisms of regulation are very different. This is followed by a short discussion of the SOS response in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_RzGDxg8Aog">E. coli</i>, illustrating how genes scattered throughout the genome can be coordinately regulated. We then describe two bacterial systems of quite different types, illustrating the diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms: regulation of ribosomal protein synthesis at the level of translation, with many of the regulatory proteins binding to RNA (rather than DNA), and regulation of the process of “phase variation” in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_wRNZSu8NmJ">Salmonella</i>, which results <span aria-label="1066" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1066" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from genetic recombination. Finally, we examine some additional examples of posttranscriptional regulation in which the RNA modulates its own function.</p>

A bacterium’s environment is too complex for its genes to be controlled by one signal. Other factors besides lactose, such as the availability of glucose, affect the expression of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_MCwUo9JoaZ">lac</i> genes. Glucose, metabolized directly by glycolysis, is the preferred energy source in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_bW9Pg1TutR">E. coli</i>. Other sugars can serve as the main or sole nutrient, but extra enzymatic steps are required to prepare them for entry into glycolysis, necessitating the synthesis of additional enzymes. Clearly, expressing the genes for proteins that metabolize sugars such as lactose or arabinose is wasteful when glucose is abundant.</p>

A horizontal strand is shown with its 5 prime end on the left and its 3 prime end on the right. From left to right, the strand is a consist of the following pieces: short blue, purple P subscript I end subscript, light red italicized lac I end italics, orange O subscript 3 end subscript, dark blue C R P-binding site, short light blue, long purple P, orange O subscript 1 end subscript,, tan italicized lac Z end italics, orange O subscript 2 end subscript, tan, light orange italicized lac Y end italics, yellow italicized lac A end italics, short blue. A repressor is present as a structure with four ovals, two on the left and two on the right, that each connect to smaller ovals on top. These ovals contact O subscript 3 end subscript and O subscript 1 end subscript, where the horizontal strand forms a loop that begins with orange O subscript 3 end subscript bending up to the dark blue C R P-binding site to the light blue piece, then to the purple P piece that makes up most of the loop before reaching the upper left of orange O subscript 1 end subscript, which returns to horizontal. At the boundary between P subscript I end subscript and italicized lac I end italics, a short vertical line extends down to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the green word O N. An arrow points from O N to the repressor. At the boundary between O 1 end subscript and italicized lac Z end italics, a short vertical line extends down to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the red word O F F. Text below reads, No gene expression. Part b is labeled, Glucose low, c A M P high, lactose absent. This shows a very similar structure except that a green rounded structure labeled C R P is visible behind the purple P loop attached to the dark blue C R P-binding site and extending against the light blue region above it. Additionally, there is a purple rectangle labeled c A M P positioned just above the blue region near the start of the P region on its rear side,, before it loops back down to O subscript 1 end subscript. Text below reads, No gene expression. Part c is labeled, Glucose high, c A M P low, lactose present. A similar structure is shown, but there is no loop. The strand runs horizontally through O subscript 3 end subscript, the dark blue region, the light blue region, P, and O subscript 1 end subscript. At the boundary between P subscript I end subscript and italicized lac I end italics, a short vertical line extends down to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the green word O N. An arrow points down to show a repressor that is not bound to the horizontal strand but that has an allolactose molecule bound to each side. Each allolactose molecule is shown as two six-membered rings joined together and attached by one ring to one of the vertical ovals of the repressor. An arrow with a red “X” over it points from the repressor to O subscript 1 end subscript. At the boundary between O subscript 1 end subscript and italicized lac Z end italics, a short vertical line extends down to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the light green word O N. Text below reads, Low level of gene expression. An arrow points down to a wavy green strand labeled R N A. Part d is labeled, Glucose low, c A M P high, lactose present. This illustration is similar to the illustration in part c except that R N A polymerase is shown as an irregular purple oval that covers the light blue and P regions and extends above and below O subscript 1 end subscript, where it has an oval cutout. A green sphere labeled C R P is attached to the dark blue region, extending slightly over the light blue region to the right, and a purple triangle labeled c A M P is bound at the top of C R P extending to the upper right of R N A polymerase.

The part from the left end to the end of the leader is labeled regulatory region and everything to the right of the leader is labeled regulated genes. An arrow points up from italicized t r p R end italics to a wavy green horizontal strand, from which an arrow points up to the T r p repressor. This is shown as a dark pink rounded structure with protrusions to the lower left and right in front of a similarly-shaped orange structure. Right- and left-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. The right-pointing arrow is joined by a curved arrow showing the addition of T r p, which is shown as a red structure with a six-membered ring that shares its top bond with a five-membered ring above that has an upper right vertex bonded to a short zigzag chain. This yields a pink repressor and an orange repressor that each contain T r p within the rounded opening formed by the protrusions to the lower left and right. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction in which these repressors bound to T r p can bind to orange O in the D N A molecule. Arrows point down from each of the five regulated genes to a long wavy green strand accompanied by text reading, italicized t r p end italics m R N A (low tryptophan levels). Below, a much shorter wavy green strand is accompanied by text reading, Attenuated m R N A (high tryptophan levels). Arrows point down from the top strand of m R N A for each regulatory gene.

It begins with a green region of p p p A A G U U C A C G U A A A A A G G G U A U C G A C A, then begins a purple region of bases accompanied by a series of amino acids labeled leader peptide. The purple bases are A U G A A A G C A A U U U U C G U A C U G A A A G G Y Y G G Y G G C G beneath 1 C A C U U C C, followed by red A G U (stop). The amino acids are M e t – L y s – A l a – I l e – P h e – V a l – L e u – L y s – G l y – T r p – T r p – A r g – T h r – S e r. Next, there is a blue region of m R N A of C G G G C A G U G U beneath 2 A U U C A C C A U G, then a green region of C G U A A A G C A A U C A G, then a yellow region of A U A C C C beneath 3 A G C C C G C C, then a green region of U A A U, then a pink region of G A G C G beneath 4 G G C U, then a green region of U U U U U labeled 139 and site of transcription attenuation, then U U G A A C A A A A U U A G A G A A U A A C A labeled 162 followed by an arrow indicating the space between this and the next A labeled end of leader region (italicized t r p L end italics). Immediately after the arrow, the A is followed by U G C A A A C A and then an arrow pointing to the right. Beneath the bases after the end of the leader region, the T r p E polypeptide is shown as M e t – G l n – T h r with an arrow pointing to the right. Part b shows a strand of m R N A color-coded to match the labeled components shown in part a. This strand of m R N A begins at the 5 prime end with a short green region, followed by a purple region with the number 1 under its left half. Two brackets just to the right of the center of this region are labeled T r p codons, with the second one inside of the bottom half of a ribosome. The m R N A runs through the orange lower subunit of a ribosome with a large yellow subunit on top. From the top of the ribosome, beginning with the part touching the ribosome, there is a red strand of letters as follows: S T R W W G K L V F I A K M. This is labeled, Completed leader peptide. To the right of the ribosome, there is a red piece of m R N A followed by a small green piece, then it becomes blue and emerges from the ribosome. The number 2 is under the center of this blue piece. Next, there is a green piece. This is followed by a yellow piece that curves down, where it is labeled 3, forms a loop, and then joins a pink region that runs up parallel to the yellow piece and is numbered 4. A bracket indicates that this is the attenuator structure. Beginning at the top of the pink region, there is a green region of seven Us that enters the small opening at the upper left of R N A polymerase and ends at its 3 prime end after looping beneath the transcription bubble of double stranded D N A. This double-stranded D N A extends upward out of the R N A polymerase and becomes tan, then runs horizontally to its left end. This tan region is labeled italicized t r p L. The R N A polymerase is a rounded structure with an opening in the center, a narrow opening at the upper left, a narrow vertical channel opening downward, and a wider opening to the right through which the blue double stranded D N A continues to the right. Text in a gray box below reads, When tryptophan levels are high, the ribosome quickly translates sequence 1 (open reading frame encoding leader peptide) and blocks sequence 2 before sequence 3 is transcribed. Continued transcription leads to attenuation at the terminator-like structure formed by sequences 3 and 4. Below, a similar structure is shown in which the ribosome has moved farther along the purple region so that both T r p codons are near its right side. From its top, the peptide is G K L V F I A K M and is labeled incomplete leader peptide. To the right of the ribosome, the red piece of m R N A is outside of the ribosome followed by a green piece, then blue piece 2 bends down, forms a green loop at the bottom, and becomes yellow part 3 near the upper right of a loop before becoming horizontal and green again. This vertical piece has three loops: a fully green bottom loop, a center loop that is blue on the let and green on the right, and a top loop that is blue on the left and yellow on the right. After the green horizontal piece, there is pink piece 4 and then more green m R N A that enters the ribosome. Text above this green region reads, italicized t r p end italics-regulated genes. The m R N A is shown looping against the lower strand of blue D N A in the transcription bubble. A gray arrow points right from R N A polymerase. Text in a gray box below reads, When tryptophan levels are low, the ribosome pauses at the T r p codons in sequence 1. Formation of the paired structure between sequences 2 and 3 prevents attenuation, because sequence 3 is no longer available for form the attenuator structure with sequence 4. The 2:3 structure, unlike the 3:4 attenuator, does not prevent transcription. Part c shows the 3:4 pair (attenuator) and the 2:3 pair. The 3:4 pair (attenuator) begins with a green piece at the lower left. From the left, it is A G, then the strand becomes yellow and has A U A labeled 110 C C, then C moving upward, then a series of bases bonded to bases on the right-hand strand. These are A G C C C G C. This yellow piece is labeled 3. There is a C that begins to curve away, then a green loop of U A A U, then the strand becomes pink as piece 4 starts. This begins with G A as the loop finishes, then begins a series of bases bonded to bases on the let-hand strand. These are G C G G G C U. Next, the strand becomes green and unpaired. It becomes horizontal and continues as U U U U U U. The 2:3 pair begins with a green piece that angles upward with A A, then begins blue piece 2 with a series of bases paired with the right-hand strand. These are C G G G C. The strand curves out with A, then G labeled 80, then U. It then starts a paired sequence of G U A, then has an unpaired U, then has paired U C, then has an unpaired loop of A C C labeled 90 A before reaching paired U G. The strand becomes green with a final paired base, C. It then forms a loop of G U A A A before reaching another series of paired bases, G labeled 100 followed by C and A. It then forms an unpaired loop of A U C A, then begins a paired series of bases with G. The strand becomes yellow with paired bases A U A numbered 110 and C, then forms an unpaired loop of C C A, then forms a paired strand with G C C C G, then curves outward with C C before reaching a green U.</p>

The narrow red bands are labeled Lex A operators. There are orange spheres labeled Lex a repressors attached to the inside of all of the narrow red bands except for the one at the lower left to the left of italicized lex A end italics. A dashed arrow from the green band labeled italicized rec A end italics points to a green sphere labeled Rec A protein. Three additional similar green spheres are present elsewhere in the cell.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6lZ4OcRznT">The RecA protein provides the functional link between the biological signal (DNA damage) and induction of the SOS genes. Heavy DNA damage leads to numerous single-strand gaps in the DNA, and only RecA that is bound to single-stranded DNA can facilitate cleavage of the LexA repressor (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GBQPFX11u3" id="dav_9781319322342_ycNsPdDDze">Fig. 28-21</a>, bottom). Binding of RecA at the gaps eventually activates its co-protease activity, leading to cleavage of the LexA repressor and SOS induction.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_a5my8NZFRM">During induction of the SOS response in a severely damaged cell, RecA also promotes the autocatalytic cleavage of, and thus inactivates, the repressors that otherwise allow propagation of certain viruses in a dormant lysogenic state within the bacterial host. This provides a remarkable illustration of evolutionary adaptation. These repressors, like LexA, undergo self-cleavage at a specific Ala–Gly peptide bond, so induction of the SOS response permits replication of the virus and lysis of the cell, releasing new viral particles. Thus, the bacteriophage can make a hasty exit from a compromised bacterial host cell.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_mWQc26oro9">In bacteria, an increased cellular demand for protein synthesis is met by increasing the number of ribosomes rather than altering the activity of individual ribosomes. In general, the number of ribosomes increases as the cellular growth rate increases. At high growth rates, ribosomes make up approximately 45% of the cell’s dry weight. The proportion of cellular resources devoted to making ribosomes is so large, and the function of ribosomes so important, that cells must coordinate the synthesis of the ribosomal components: the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and RNAs (rRNAs). <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_2GfIMfKoHr" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> This regulation is distinct from the mechanisms described so far: it occurs largely at the level of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_5TkC9QHMV9">translation</i>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_vEg2OquFIO">The 52 genes that encode the r-proteins are distributed across at least 20 operons, each with 1 to 11 genes. Some of these operons also contain the genes for the subunits of DNA primase, RNA polymerase, and protein synthesis elongation factors — reflecting the close coupling of replication, transcription, and protein synthesis during bacterial cell growth.</p>

In general, the r-protein that plays the role of repressor also binds directly to an rRNA. Each translational repressor r-protein binds with higher affinity to the appropriate rRNA than to its mRNA, so the mRNA is bound and translation repressed only when the level of the r-protein exceeds that of the rRNA. This ensures that translation of the mRNAs encoding r-proteins is repressed only when synthesis of these r-proteins exceeds that needed to make functional ribosomes. In this way, the rate of r-protein synthesis is kept in balance with rRNA availability.</p>

In other operons this would affect only that one gene, because in bacterial polycistronic mRNAs, most genes have independent translation signals. In the r-protein operons, however, the translation of one gene depends on the translation of all the others. The translation of multiple genes seems to be blocked by folding of the mRNA into an elaborate three-dimensional structure that is stabilized both by internal base pairing and by binding of the translational repressor protein. When the translational repressor is absent, ribosome binding and translation of one or more of the genes disrupts the folded structure of the mRNA and allows all the genes to be translated.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_rDkppy3QPQ">As described throughout this chapter, proteins play an important and well-documented role in regulating gene expression. But RNA also has a crucial role — one that is becoming increasingly recognized as more examples of regulatory RNAs are discovered. Once an mRNA is synthesized, its functions can be controlled by RNA-binding proteins, as seen for the r-protein operons just described, or by an RNA. A separate RNA molecule may bind to the mRNA “in trans” and affect its activity. Alternatively, a portion of the mRNA itself may regulate its own function. When part of a molecule affects the function of another part of the same molecule, it is said to act “in cis.”</p>

The eukaryotic TPP riboswitch is found in the introns of certain genes and modulates the alternative splicing of those genes. It is not yet clear how common riboswitches are.

The sRNAs and riboswitches, like ribozymes and ribosomes, may be vestiges of an RNA world obscured by time but persisting as a rich array of biological devices still functioning in the biosphere. The laboratory selection of aptamers and ribozymes with novel ligand-binding and enzymatic functions tells us that the RNA-based activities necessary for a viable RNA world are possible. Discovery of many of the same RNA functions in living organisms tells us that key components for RNA-based metabolism do exist. For example, the natural aptamers of riboswitches may be derived from RNAs that, billions of years ago, bound to cofactors needed to promote the enzymatic processes required for metabolism in the RNA world.</p>
