<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ombs7gavqq">Bicarbonate is shown as a red highlighted molecule with a central C double bonded to O to the upper left, bonded to O to the lower left further bonded to H below, and bonded to O minus to the right. A T P is shown to its right has a rectangle labeled adenosine bonded to a vertical chain of a circle labeled P bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to O bonded to P double bonded to O to the right and bonded to O minus below and to the left. Curved red arrows point from O minus at the right side of bicarbonate to P of the bottom phosphate group of A T P and from the bond between P of the bottom phosphate group of A T P and the O above it. To the lower right, pyruvate carboxylase is shown as a curved surface of pyruvate carboxylase with crescent-shaped pieces on the left and right ends labeled as catalytic site 1 and catalytic site 2, respectively. Biotinyl-lysine is shown extending up from L y s in the center of pyruvate carboxylase. L y s has a bond that extends into the open region above pyruvate carboxylase, where it joins N bonded to H and bonded to a five-carbon zigzag chain with the first carbon, adjacent to N H, double bonded to O, and the fifth carbon at the top bonded to the lower right vertex of a five-membered ring joined with another five-membered ring above. The bottom five-membered ring has S at its bottom vertex, to the left of the lower right vertex bonded to the vertical zigzag chain, and shares its top side with the bottom side of another five-carbon ring that has N substituted for C and bonded to H at its upper left and right vertices and its top vertex double bonded to O. Step 1: Bicarbonate is activated by A T P, forming carboxyphosphate. An arrow points right with a curved arrow that branches away to show the loss of A D P. This yields carboxyphosphate, shown in brackets as a red highlighted piece bonded to phosphate. It has red highlighted C connected by a red double bond to red highlighted O to its upper left, connected by a red bond to red highlighted O to its lower left further connected by a red bond to red highlighted H below, and a nonhighlighted bond to O further bonded to P double bonded to O above and bonded to O minus to the right and below. Curved red arrows are shown from the bond between red highlighted O and H beneath the central red highlighted C to the bond between the same red highlighted O and red highlighted C and from the bond between the red highlighted C and the nonhighlighted O to its right to the same O. Step 2: Carboxyphosphate breaks down to C O 2. A right-pointing arrow has a curved arrow branching away to show the loss of P subscript i. This yields a product of red highlighted C connected by red double bonds to red highlighted O to its upper left and lower right next to biotinyl-lysine that now has a pair of red electrons on N at the upper left vertex of the top ring. Curved red arrows point from the pair of red electrons to the red highlighted C and from the red double bond between the same C and O to its lower right and the O to it lower right. Step 3: C O 2 reacts with biotin to form carboxybiotin. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow that branches away to show the loss of H plus. This yields a similar molecule except that N H at the upper left vertex of the top ring of biotin is bonded to red highlighted C to its left connected by a red double bond to O to its upper left and by a red bond to O minus to its lower left. Step 4: Biotin transports the C O 2 from one active site to the other. An arrow points down. A similar structure is shown except that biotin has changed its orientation so that the first C of the zigzag chain is now double bonded to O to the left and the N that had been at the upper left vertex of the top ring is now at the upper right vertex, where it is bonded to red highlighted C connected by a red double bond to O to its upper right and by a red bond to O minus to its lower right. Curved red arrows point from the double bond between the top vertex of the upper five-membered ring and O to the same O, from the bond between the red highlighted C and N at the upper right vertex of the top ring to the upper right bond of the same ring, and from the negative sign on the red highlighted O to the bond between the same O and the red highlighted C. Step 5: Biotin is decarboxylated. Pyruvate is converted to its enolate form. An arrow points right and is joined by a line showing the addition of pyruvate. This yields a similar structure except that the upper ring of biotin now has a double bond at the upper right side and the top vertex has a single bond to O minus above. A red highlighted molecule with C double bonded to O on each side is shown. To the right of the upper ring of biotin, a pyruvate molecule is shown with a vertical three-carbon chain with the top carbon bonded to O minus to the upper left and double bonded to O to the upper right, the middle carbon double bonded to O to the right, and the bottom carbon bonded to 2 H and to H below. Curved red arrows point from the negative charge on O bonded to the top vertex of the top ring to the bond connecting the same O to the top vertex, from the double bond at the upper right side of the top ring to H bonded beneath the bottom C of the pyruvate, from the bond between H bonded to the bottom C of pyruvate and the bond between the bottom and middle carbons of pyruvate, and from the double bond between the middle carbon of pyruvate and oxygen to the same oxygen. Step 6: Pyruvate enolate reacts with C O 2 to form oxaloacetate. An arrow points to the right. Biotin appears similar except that there is a double bond between the top vertex and O and N at the upper right vertex is bonded to H. Pyruvate enolate is shown as a vertical three-carbon chain with the top C bonded to O minus to the upper left and double bonded to O to the upper right, the middle C bonded to O minus to the right and double bonded to the bottom C below, and the bottom C bonded to 2 H. The red highlighted molecule with C double bonded to O on each side is also present. Curved red arrows point from the negative charge on O bonded to the middle C of pyruvate enolase to the bond between the same O and the middle C, from the double bond between the middle and bottom carbons of pyruvate enolate and the red highlighted C in C O 2, and from the double bond between C in C O 2 and O to its lower right and the same O. Step 7: Oxaloacetate is released. This yields oxaloacetate, shown as a vertical four-carbon chain with the top carbon bonded to O minus to the upper left and double bonded to O to the upper right, the second carbon double bonded to O to the right, the third carbon bonded to 2 H, and the red highlighted fourth carbon connected by a red double bond to red highlighted O to the lower right and connected by a red bond to red highlighted O minus at the lower right.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_jiS8VbcF2B">The top molecule has a large green sphere labeled dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E subscript 2) at the right side. Two bonds extend from its left side. The top bond extends to C double bonded to O above, from which a bond extends down to the left to C H. The bottom bond extends to N bonded to H, from which a bond extends up to the left to the same C H, forming a triangular opening between the upper and lower chains and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase. A four-carbon zigzag chain extends to the left from the C H where the right-hand chains join, then bonds to N. A bracket shows that the entire piece from this N to the bonds connecting these chains to dihydrolipoyl transacetylase represent a lysine residue. N is further bonded to a five-carbon zigzag chain with the first carbon, adjacent to N, double bonded to O above and the terminal carbon bonded to the upper right vertex of a five-membered ring that has S substituted for C at the lower left and right vertices with both S atoms and the bond connecting them highlighted in red. The part of the structure to the left of the N at the end of the L y s residue is labeled lipoate. The middle molecule has a medium-sized green sphere labeled pyruvate carboxylase at the left side. To its left, there is a L y s residue similar to the one in the top molecule and joined to a similar five-carbon chain with its first carbon, adjacent to N, double bonded to O above. The five-carbon chain ends by bonding to the lower right vertex of a five-membered ring with S at the bottom vertex and a top side shared with the bottom side of a second five-membered ring above in the opposite orientation (with a single vertex pointing up instead of down). The top five-membered ring has N substituted for C at the upper left and right vertices and each bonded to H with the left-hand N H enclosed in a red box. The top vertex is double bonded to O. The part of the molecule to the left of the terminal N of the L y s residue is labeled biotin. The bottom molecule has a small green sphere labeled acyl carrier protein at its right side. This has a bond extending to S e r to the left, from which a bond extends to O bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the left that begins an eight-member pantothenate chain. Beginning at O on its right side, this chain has C H 2, C bonded to 2 C H 3 above, C bonded to O H below, C double bonded to O above, N substituted for C and bonded to H, C H 2, C H 2, and C double bonded to O above and further bonded to N outside of pantothenate. This N is bonded to H and forms the right end of Greek letter beta-mercaptoethylamine. N is bonded to a two-carbon zigzag chain that ends at S H in a red box.</p>
