Obesity is life-threatening. It significantly increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as heart attack, stroke, and cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and endometrium. Consequently, there is great interest in understanding how body mass and the storage of fats in adipose tissue are regulated. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_kjH7PqTe6J" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_14_pg523.png"/></p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qHfXn2cet7">To a first approximation, obesity is the result of taking in more calories in the diet than are expended by the body’s fuel-consuming activities. The body can deal with an excess of dietary calories in three ways: (1) convert excess fuel to fat and store it in adipose tissue, (2) burn excess fuel by extra exercise, and (3) “waste” fuel by diverting it to heat production (thermogenesis) by uncoupled mitochondria. <span class="keep" id="dav_9781319322342_au4l5vx2X0"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_XrXscj5XBK" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> In mammals,</span> a complex set of hormonal and neuronal signals acts to keep fuel intake and energy expenditure in balance so as to hold the amount of adipose tissue at a suitable level. Dealing effectively with obesity requires understanding how the various checks and balances work under normal conditions and how these homeostatic mechanisms can fail.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_wPci2U8pJ4">One early hypothesis to explain body-mass homeostasis, the “adiposity negative-feedback” model, postulated a mechanism that inhibits eating behavior and increases energy expenditure whenever body weight exceeds a certain value, called the set point; the inhibition is relieved when body weight drops below the set point (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZEByantu0P" id="dav_9781319322342_GpN7dW9glm"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_3JWiRNzPsc">Fig. 23-29</strong></a>). This model predicts that a feedback signal originating in adipose tissue influences the brain centers that control eating behavior and metabolic and motor activity. The first such signal to be discovered was leptin, in 1994. Subsequent research revealed that <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_RCXKt6Y8Nn" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that produces peptide hormones, known as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_R0M7MDci20">adipokines</dfn>. Adipokines may act locally (autocrine and paracrine action) or systemically (endocrine action), carrying information about the adequacy of the energy reserves (TAGs) stored in adipose tissue to other tissues and to the brain. Normally, adipokines produce changes in fuel metabolism and feeding behavior that reestablish adequate fuel reserves and maintain body mass. When adipokines are over- or underproduced, the resulting dysregulation may result in life-threatening disease.</p>

Leptin carries the message that fat reserves are sufficient, and it promotes reduction of fuel intake and increase in expenditure of energy. Leptin-receptor interaction in the hypothalamus alters the release of neuronal signals to the region of the brain that affects appetite. Leptin also stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, increasing blood pressure, heart rate, and thermogenesis by uncoupling the mitochondria of brown adipocytes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_8LgFSJXwWq" id="dav_9781319322342_vOiUj59uwv">Fig. 23-31b</a>). Recall that the uncoupling protein UCP1 forms a channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that allows protons to reenter the mitochondrial matrix without passing through the ATP synthase complex. This permits constant oxidation of fuel (fatty acids in a brown or beige adipocyte) without ATP synthesis, dissipating energy as heat and consuming dietary calories or stored fats in potentially large amounts.</p>

The Ragulator-Rag complex is tethered to the lysosomal membrane by covalently linked lipids. When mTORC1 is docked to the Ragulator-Rag complex, it is in contact with another G protein, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_8lkcShnaqo">Rheb</dfn> (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_FWxB3eadcr" id="dav_9781319322342_0TZ8ICSWV3"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_LuLGz0c1L8">Fig. 23-35</strong></a>). This massive complex integrates signals from inside and outside of the lysosome about the energy status of the cell, the availability of critical amino acids needed for protein synthesis, and the presence of growth factors. When these signals indicate that the cell has what it needs to grow, GTP-bound Rheb activates the protein kinase activity of mTOR, which then phosphorylates many different proteins required for transcription, increased ribosome synthesis, and expression of genes encoding the enzymes of lipid synthesis and mitochondrial proliferation (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_olI2KWmKPb" id="dav_9781319322342_7F8AYHheUe"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_aovQWHUYuT">Fig. 23-36</strong></a>). Because the lysosome is where the cell recycles defective or unneeded components, or extracellular substances brought into the cell through phagocytosis, it is, in effect, the warehouse of parts for cellular construction. The mTORC1-Ragulator-Rag complex is the supply chain manager determining whether the assembly line can operate.</p>

Chronic activation of mTORC1 by overeating results in excess deposition of TAGs in adipose tissue, as well as in liver and muscle, which may contribute to insulin insensitivity and type 2 diabetes. Mutations that produce constantly activated mTORC1 are commonly associated with human cancers.</p>

These microbes function as a major endocrine organ, producing a variety of metabolites with profound effects on host metabolism, feeding behavior, and body mass. Lean and obese individuals harbor different combinations of microbial symbionts in the gut. Investigation of this observation led to the discovery that gut microbes release fermentation products — the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate — that enter the bloodstream and trigger metabolic changes in adipose tissue (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_tLFsXufuE1" id="dav_9781319322342_OBGK197xM5"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Qa2HNvqnZA">Fig. 23-41</strong></a>). Propionate, for example, drives the expansion of white adipose tissue by acting on GPCRs in the plasma membranes of several cell types, including adipocytes. These receptors trigger differentiation of precursor cells (preadipocytes) into adipocytes and inhibit lipolysis in existing adipocytes, leading to an increase in white adipose tissue mass — that is, obesity. Gut microbes also convert primary bile acids, synthesized in the liver, into the secondary bile acids deoxycholate and lithocholate, which enter the bloodstream and act through GPCRs and steroid receptors to activate beige adipocytes to produce UCP1 and increase energy expenditure.</p>

For example, the metabolism of primary bile acids by microbiota produces secondary products that act through nuclear receptors to stimulate thermogenesis in host brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increase both energy consumption and insulin sensitivity, while reducing inflammation. Metabolism of undigested carbohydrates by microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that signal expansion of the host’s white adipose tissue (WAT), promoting obesity. SCFAs produced by microbiota are also a readily metabolizable energy source for the host. Microbial production of the SCFA propionate prevents lipogenesis in the liver and lowers blood cholesterol, both favorable to health.
