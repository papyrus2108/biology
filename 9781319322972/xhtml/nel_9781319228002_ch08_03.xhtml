<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_OTHDfzttSn">The discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 gave rise to entirely new disciplines and influenced the course of many established ones. In this section we <span aria-label="270" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page270" role="doc-pagebreak"/>focus on DNA structure, some of the events that led to its discovery, and more recent refinements in our understanding of DNA. We also introduce RNA structure.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_TnN2buHs6d">As in the case of protein structure (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_h2H1GbPZdU" id="dav_9781319322342_bCLTE06X1g">Chapter 4</a>), it is sometimes useful to describe nucleic acid structure in terms of hierarchical levels of complexity (primary, secondary, tertiary). The primary structure of a nucleic acid is its covalent structure and nucleotide sequence. Any regular, stable structure taken up by some or all of the nucleotides in a nucleic acid can be referred to as secondary structure. Most structures considered in the remainder of this chapter fall under the heading of secondary structure. The complex folding of large chromosomes within eukaryotic chromatin and bacterial nucleoids, or the elaborate folding of large tRNA or rRNA molecules, is generally considered tertiary structure. DNA tertiary structure is discussed in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_NiXMIb5pnu" id="dav_9781319322342_T5Z0v3OEWC">Chapter 24</a>.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_24b98hGDOk">DNA was first isolated and characterized by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. He called the phosphorus-containing substance “nuclein.” Not until the 1940s, with the work of Oswald T. Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, was there any compelling evidence that DNA was the genetic material. Avery and his colleagues found that an extract of a virulent strain of the bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_V0FI8yeMLf">Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (causing disease in mice) could be used to transform a nonvirulent strain of the same bacterium into a virulent strain. They were able to demonstrate through various chemical tests that it was DNA from the virulent strain (not protein, polysaccharide, or RNA, for example) that carried the genetic information for virulence. Then in 1952, experiments by Alfred D. Hershey and Martha Chase — in which they studied the infection of bacterial cells by a virus (bacteriophage) with radioactively labeled DNA or protein — removed any remaining doubt that DNA, not protein, carried the genetic information.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tL5dMEFuOh">Another important clue to the structure of DNA came from the work of Erwin Chargaff and his colleagues in the late 1940s. Examining dozens of species, they found that the four nucleotide bases of DNA occur in different ratios in the DNAs of different organisms. However, the base composition remains constant in different tissues of the same species, and does not vary with age, environment, nutritional state, or generation. Furthermore, regardless of the species, the number of adenosine residues is equal to the number of thymidine residues (that is, A = T), and the number of guanosine residues is equal to the number of cytidine residues (G = C). From these relationships it follows that the sum of the purine residues equals the sum of the pyrimidine residues; that is, A + G = T + C. These quantitative relationships, sometimes called “Chargaff’s rules,” were a key to establishing the three-dimensional structure of DNA.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_wbzLmzvsCn">To shed more light on the structure of DNA, in the early 1950s Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used the powerful method of x-ray diffraction (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qjoNXstTVX" id="dav_9781319322342_hU8mnPyXvJ">Fig. 4-30</a>) to analyze DNA fibers. Although lacking the molecular definition of diffraction from crystals, the x-ray diffraction pattern generated from the fibers was informative (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_pDUJtQzyX4"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_CmJYy9diqw" id="dav_9781319322342_bMp6oj0tV9">Fig. 8-12</a></strong>). The pattern revealed that DNA molecules are helical, with two periodicities along their long axis: a primary one of 3.4 Å and a secondary one of 34 Å. The problem then was to formulate a three-dimensional model of the DNA molecule that could account not only for the x-ray diffraction data but also for the specific A = T and G = C base equivalences discovered by Chargaff and for the other chemical properties of DNA.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_lpKZmhjqhQ">James Watson and Francis Crick relied on this accumulated information about DNA to set about deducing its structure. In 1953 they postulated a three-dimensional model of DNA structure that accounted for all the available data. It consists of two helical DNA chains wound around the same axis to form a right-handed double helix. (See <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Bt20AcwaEt" id="dav_9781319322342_5AyDfm3co7">Box 4-1</a> for an explanation of the right- or left-handed sense of a helical structure.)

The purine and pyrimidine bases of both strands are stacked inside the double helix, with their hydrophobic and nearly planar ring structures very close together and perpendicular to the long axis. The offset pairing of the two strands creates a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_ml1kHWTVBY">major groove</dfn> and a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_wGrqzQoLPy">minor groove</dfn> on the surface of the duplex (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_CRBw9FP3mz"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_xDiN64k4LB" id="dav_9781319322342_2leI4j9NwS">Fig. 8-13</a></strong>). Each nucleotide base of one strand is paired in the same plane with a base of the other strand. Watson and Crick found that the hydrogen-bonded base pairs illustrated in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_F9a3TIvm0j" id="dav_9781319322342_2IaZbPojhW">Figure 8-11</a>, G with C and A with T, are those that fit best within the structure, providing a rationale for Chargaff’s rule that in any DNA, G = C and A = T. It is important to note that three hydrogen bonds can form between G and C, symbolized G≡C, but only two can form between A and T, symbolized A═T. Pairings of bases other than G with C and A with T tend (to varying degrees) to destabilize the double-helical structure.</p>

The complementarity between the DNA strands is attributable to the hydrogen bonding between base pairs; however, the hydrogen bonds do not contribute significantly to the stability of the structure. The double helix is primarily stabilized by metal cations, which shield the negative charges of backbone phosphates, and by base-stacking interactions between successive base pairs.

A fourth begins at the rear right and curves along the rear up to the top left. Single and double ring bases extend into the center from all four strands. Part e shows two structures. The one on the left, labeled parallel, has three horizontal layers that each contain four sets of double rings, each with one six-membered ring and one five-membered ring, with one pair of rings in each corner in the same location on each layer. Arrows run from below the bottom layer to above the top layer along each corner, and all point upward. The structure on the right, labeled antiparallel, has a similar structure except that the left front and right back arrows point up and the left rear and right front arrows point down.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_7bnqpD9wFU">We now turn our attention to the expression of the genetic information that DNA contains. Given that the DNA of eukaryotes is largely confined to the nucleus, whereas protein synthesis occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm, some molecule other than DNA must carry the genetic message from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As early as the 1950s, RNA was considered the logical candidate: RNA is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and an increase in protein synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the amount of cytoplasmic RNA and an increase in its rate of turnover. These and other observations led several researchers to suggest that RNA carries genetic information from DNA to the protein-synthesizing machinery of the ribosome. In 1961, François Jacob and Jacques Monod presented a unified (and essentially correct) picture of many aspects of this process. They proposed the name “messenger RNA” (mRNA) for that portion of the total <span aria-label="275" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page275" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cellular RNA carrying the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_A2F0biz9Cc" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/><span class="keep" id="dav_9781319322342_xfgB17Ug7l"> </span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_S09AdYXMvi" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01b.png"/> The mRNAs are formed on a DNA template by the process of <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_8voIFHxf4L"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_uDgXZGo1QD" id="dav_9781319322342_ON82VsvmZR" role="doc-glossref">transcription</a></dfn>. Once they reach the ribosomes, the messengers provide the templates that specify amino acid sequences in polypeptide chains.

In eukaryotes, most mRNAs are monocistronic. (For the purposes of this discussion, “cistron” refers to a gene. The term itself has historical roots in the science of genetics, and its formal genetic definition is beyond the scope of this text.) The minimum length of an mRNA is set in part by the length of the polypeptide chain for which it codes. For example, a polypeptide chain of 100 amino acid residues requires an RNA coding sequence of at least 300 nucleotides, because each amino acid is coded by a nucleotide triplet (this and other details of protein synthesis are discussed in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_BYqFhEgCmw">Chapter 27</a>). However, mRNAs transcribed from DNA are always somewhat longer than the length needed simply to code for a polypeptide sequence (or sequences).

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_opzQ1xwRSX">Messenger RNA is only one of several classes of cellular RNA. Transfer RNAs are adapter molecules that act in protein synthesis; covalently linked to an amino acid at one end, each tRNA pairs with the mRNA in such a way that amino acids are joined to a growing polypeptide in the correct sequence. Ribosomal RNAs are components of ribosomes. There is also a wide variety of noncoding RNAs, including some (called ribozymes) that have enzymatic activity. All the RNAs are considered in detail in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_3Se0cYPuFz">Chapter 26</a>.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_yvl3zASeOO">The product of transcription of DNA is always single-stranded RNA. The single strand tends to assume a right-handed helical conformation dominated by base-stacking interactions (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_MVD9WQdO1U"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fRCDKIOEDV" id="dav_9781319322342_rGKxEMdfMc">Fig. 8-22</a></strong>), which are stronger between two purines than between a purine and a pyrimidine or between two pyrimidines. The purine-purine interaction is so strong that a pyrimidine separating two purines is often displaced from the stacking pattern so that the purines can interact. Any self-complementary sequences in the molecule trigger folding into structures with more complexity. RNA can base-pair with complementary regions of either RNA or DNA. Base pairing matches the pattern for DNA: G pairs with C and A pairs with U (or with the occasional T residue in some RNAs). One difference is that base pairing between G and U residues is allowed in RNA (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_WEjwq3XQzL" id="dav_9781319322342_FaNIQsE6R1">Fig. 8-24</a>) when complementary sequences in two single strands of RNA (or within a single strand of RNA that folds back on itself to align the residues) pair with each other.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_kdMNvdoDhM">When two strands of RNA with perfectly complementary sequences are paired, the predominant double-stranded structure is an A-form right-handed double helix. However, strands of RNA that are perfectly paired over long regions of sequence are uncommon. The three-dimensional structures of many RNAs, like those of proteins, are complex and unique. Weak interactions, especially base-stacking interactions, help stabilize RNA structures, just as they do in DNA. Z-form helices have been made in the laboratory (under very high-salt or high-temperature conditions). The B form of RNA has not been observed. Breaks in the regular A-form helix caused by mismatched or unmatched bases in one or both strands are common and result in bulges or internal loops (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_AfX292QegS"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Ew3P9SptoS" id="dav_9781319322342_APdqFVYpLO">Fig. 8-23</a></strong>).

Specific short base sequences (such as UUCG) are often found at the ends of RNA hairpins and are known to form particularly tight and stable loops. Such sequences may act as starting points for the folding of an RNA molecule into its precise three-dimensional structure. Other contributions are made by hydrogen bonds that are not part of standard Watson-Crick base pairs.

The bottom of the right strand connects to a line that extends horizontally, then bends vertically, then extends horizontally to a piece that goes upward, piece 3, and has X-shaped bonds beneath a horizontal bond connecting it with a longer piece on its left from which a strand runs horizontally back to the bottom right strand of piece 1. The longer left strand has three angled bars to the left to a long strand that is connected below by a strand that runs horizontally, has a short vertical piece, and then runs horizontally to join the top right of piece 1 at the far left. A strand extends from the bottom left side of piece 1 and runs horizontally across the bottom, then bends vertically before bending to meet the top right side of a vertical piece, piece 4. The right side of piece 4 runs lower than the left side and has a line above to vertical piece 5, which has a slight bump on its left side. Its left side has a horizontal strand below that connects to the small piece with a single bond and an X-shaped bond to piece 3, before running back to the bottom right side of piece 2. A strand from the top right half of piece 5 bends horizontally and then down to the left side of piece 3. A strand from the top right of piece 5 extends up to a short horizontal piece, piece 6, with three horizontal bars and then a dot at the top. A line runs horizontally from the bottom right side of piece 6 to a small vertical single piece before bending to the left and then up again to join the right side of a diagonal piece, piece 7. A strand extends down from the bottom right of piece 7 to a horizontal piece, then jogs downward to a stem loop with the curved part at the bottom, piece 8. A strand extends from the top right of piece 8 and runs horizontally for a short distance before bending down to the previously referenced long piece that has three angled bars from which a strand runs to the to right of piece 1. The diagonal piece 7 has four sets of bonds and then opens into a loop. Two strands extend from the top of the loop and run diagonally up to the right, then horizontally, before joining the top of piece 9, which runs diagonally down to an opening with a half-loop on the left and a strand on the right before forming a vertical piece, piece 10, with one bar, a dot, and then two bars. A close-up of the region with the dot is shown to the right. Beneath piece 10, a strand runs from the bottom of the right side to the bottom of the right side of vertical piece 11 below, from which a strand runs up from the top left to the bottom left of piece 10. A strand runs from the bottom left side of piece 11 to the bottom of the first horizontal piece of the S domain, piece 12, and a strand runs horizontally from the top left side of piece 11 to bend down to meet a short vertical piece, piece 13, with a dot between the strands at the top and three bars below. A strand runs horizontally from the top of piece 13 and then bends vertically to meet the left end of the first piece of the S domain, piece 12. A strand runs horizontally from the bottom right of piece 13 to bend up through a small piece that connects to a strand that bends left and then up to join the top strand of diagonal piece 7. A strand runs from the bottom left of piece 13 to the left side of piece 5, which has a small bump on its left side. The S domain begins with piece 12, which is a small horizontal piece with a dot between the strand on the left and then four bars. The top connects to a strand that bends up, right, and then up to join the left side of an opening in the middle of piece 14, which is a horizontal piece with loops on each end connected by a short strand at the top. A strand runs down from the right half of the opening at the bottom of piece 14 and bends left to join the top half of diagonal piece 15, which is a large piece that angles down to the right. A strand runs from the bottom of piece 12 to the bottom half of diagonal piece 15. This piece has a loop on the top and a loop on the bottom. The top strand bends upward to an irregular, large, bumpy region before ending with another diagonal horizontal piece that ends in a loop. The complementary side of the loop runs straight apart from a small bump just before the large, bumpy region above and then has a small bump underneath the middle of the bumpy region before a strand runs down vertically to a horizontal piece, piece 16, with loops on each side. There are many irregular bonds at different angles in the wide bumpy region. A pair of strands runs down from piece 15 to the horizontal loop structure below, one from each side of an opening in diagonal piece 15 beneath the left side of the bumpy region. The horizontal loop structure has a small bump on the top just to the left of where the vertical strands join and has a strand with a small larger piece on it across the bottom beneath the open region. Part b shows a t R N A with three different parts. The bottom part extends up vertically to meet the top two parts, one extending out to the left and one extending out to the right.</p>

Some of the earliest evidence came from the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment, which showed that DNA isolated from one bacterial strain can enter and transform the cells of another strain, endowing the second strain with some of the inheritable characteristics of the donor. The Hershey-Chase experiment showed that the DNA of a bacterial virus, but not its protein coat, carries the genetic message for replication of the virus in a host cell.</li>
