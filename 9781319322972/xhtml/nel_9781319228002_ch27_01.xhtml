<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_041yhBE4B1">Almost every biological process requires one or more proteins. A typical cell requires thousands of different proteins at any given moment. These proteins must be synthesized in response to the cell’s current needs, modified to alter their activity or fate, transported (targeted) to their appropriate cellular locations, and degraded when no longer needed. Dozens of separate processes contribute to cellular <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_DvqhQgk2Yh">proteostasis</dfn>, the steady-state complement of proteins that enable the life of a cell at any given moment.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_btWyfg6QdX">Many of the fundamental components and mechanisms used by the protein biosynthetic machinery are remarkably well conserved in all life-forms, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, indicating that they were present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all extant organisms. Whereas the chapter focuses on protein biosynthesis, all aspects of proteostasis are considered. The principles that guide our approach are interrelated, reflecting all of these realities and more.</p>

Protein synthesis consumes more cellular resources than any other process in most cells. The 15,000 ribosomes, 100,000 molecules of protein synthesis–related protein factors and enzymes, and 200,000 tRNA molecules in a typical bacterial cell can account for more than 35% of the cell’s dry weight. Overall, almost 300 <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_NsBspECg4t">different</i> macromolecules cooperate to synthesize polypeptides. Protein synthesis can account for up to 90% of the chemical energy used by a cell for all biosynthetic reactions. Why? The enzymatic synthesis of an amide bond should require little energetic input. However, the sequence of amino acids in a protein is a form of biological information. Synthesis of each amide (peptide) bond between two <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_51IhdrOjsy">particular</i> amino acids is ensured by the investment of more than four nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs).</p></li>

However, proteins often function only in particular cellular locations and at particular times. Mechanisms for spatial and temporal regulation — protein targeting, activation, and eventual degradation — exhibit complexities that can approach those of the biosynthetic processes.</p></li>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_QXCIFwUalY">Several major advances set the stage for our present knowledge of protein biosynthesis (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_jU6OIL6wGg"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_uypbb30d5M" id="dav_9781319322342_ZVbCWew37a">Fig. 27-1</a></strong>). First, in the early 1950s, Paul Zamecnik and Elizabeth Keller discovered the ribonucleoprotein particles in which protein synthesis occurs. These particles, visible in animal tissues by electron microscopy, were later named ribosomes. Soon after, Francis Crick considered how the genetic information encoded in the 4-letter language of nucleic acids could be translated into the 20-letter language of proteins. In 1955, Crick postulated that a small nucleic acid could serve the role of an adaptor, with one part of the adaptor molecule binding a specific amino acid and another part recognizing the nucleotide sequence encoding that amino acid in an mRNA (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_d33WE2I5pP"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Qieao9mdNP" id="dav_9781319322342_E7VnsMqZDI">Fig. 27-2</a></strong>). Crick’s adaptor hypothesis was soon verified when Mahlon Hoagland and Zamecnik discovered tRNA. The structure of alanyl-tRNA was reported by Robert Holley in 1964. The tRNA adaptor “translates” the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The overall process of mRNA-guided protein synthesis is often referred to simply as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_vFaawumzl0"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_iUtYSHTeIO" id="dav_9781319322342_zrDKkQqJJf" role="doc-glossref">translation</a></dfn>. Hoagland, Zamecnik, and Elizabeth Keller also discovered that amino acids were “activated” for protein synthesis when incubated with ATP and the cytosolic fraction of liver cells.

The bases are rectangular below but have different shapes on top. The tops are as follows. Tan C has a triangular cutout, brown U has a rectangular protrusion, blue A has a rectangular cutout, and green G has a triangular protrusion. From left to right, the sequence of nucleotides is C U A U G A C U A G U C G G. A bracket enclosing A C U in the center of the strand is labeled, nucleotide triplet coding for an amino acid. Directly above this triplet, a vertical light green rectangle labeled adaptor (t R N A) is positioned so that protrusions and cutouts in its lower end match the cutouts and protrusions of the bases. It has a rectangular protrusion above the rectangular cutout in A, a triangular protrusion above the triangular cutout in C, and a rectangular cutout above the rectangular protrusion in U. The top of this green vertical rectangle is a concave shape that fits against a blue sphere above labeled amino acid.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_crMjVLGFDD">These developments soon led to recognition of the major stages of protein synthesis and ultimately to elucidation of the genetic code that specifies each amino acid. In subsequent decades, ribosomes were purified and their protein and rRNA components were dissected. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of ribosomes was completed by 2000, confirming a hypothesis first put forward by Harry Noller two decades earlier: it is the rRNA, rather than ribosomal proteins, that catalyzes peptide bond formation.</p>
