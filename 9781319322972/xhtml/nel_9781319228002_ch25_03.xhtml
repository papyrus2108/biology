Maintaining the integrity of the information in DNA is a cellular imperative, supported by an elaborate set of DNA repair systems. DNA can become damaged by a variety of processes, some spontaneous, others catalyzed by environmental agents (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_2gq4Esi0ce" id="dav_9781319322342_ceAeQn4IQi">Chapter 8</a>).

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_bLoLryLnSN">In mammals there is a strong correlation between the accumulation of mutations and cancer. A simple test developed by Bruce Ames in the 1970s measures the potential of a given chemical compound to promote certain easily detected mutations in a specialized bacterial strain (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_FS7RiVXNkf"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_cwPj7dhRZP" id="dav_9781319322342_rDxOZlWZah">Fig. 25-19</a></strong>). Few of the chemicals that we encounter in daily life score as mutagens in this test. However, of the compounds known to be carcinogenic from extensive animal trials, more than 90% are also found to be mutagenic in the Ames test. Because of this strong correlation between mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, the Ames test for bacterial mutagens is still widely used as a rapid and inexpensive screen for potential human carcinogens.</p>

Three identical nutrient plates (b), (c), and (d) have been inoculated with an equal number of cells. Each plate then receives a disk of filter paper containing progressively lower concentrations of a mutagen. The mutagen greatly increases the rate of back-mutation and hence the number of colonies. The clear areas around the filter paper indicate where the concentration of mutagen is so high that it is lethal to the cells. As the mutagen diffuses away from the filter paper, it is diluted to sublethal concentrations that promote back-mutation. Mutagens can be compared on the basis of their effect on mutation rate. Because many compounds undergo a variety of chemical transformations after entering cells, compounds are sometimes tested for mutagenicity after first incubating them with a liver extract. Some substances have been found to be mutagenic only after this treatment. [Bruce N. Ames, University of California, Berkeley, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.]</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_BIoHhyAkX0">Human cancers develop when genes that regulate normal cell division (oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_puAdTsYtlu" id="dav_9781319322342_YXMvolqMYg">Chapter 12</a>) fail to function, are activated at the wrong time, or are altered. As a consequence, cells may grow out of control and form a tumor. The genes controlling cell division can be damaged by spontaneous mutation or overridden by the invasion of a tumor virus (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_zZFjWU1IBM">Chapter 26</a>). Not surprisingly, alterations in DNA repair genes that result in a higher rate of mutation can greatly increase an individual’s susceptibility to cancer. Defects in the genes encoding the proteins involved in nucleotide-excision repair, mismatch repair, recombinational repair, and error-prone translesion DNA synthesis have all been linked to human cancers. Clearly, DNA repair can be a matter of life and death.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_bwaThvl0MZ">Nucleotide-excision repair requires a larger number of proteins in humans than in bacteria, although the overall pathways are very similar. Genetic defects that inactivate nucleotide-excision repair have been associated with several genetic diseases, the best-studied of which is xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Because nucleotide-excision repair is the sole repair pathway for pyrimidine dimers in humans, people with XP are extremely sensitive to light and readily develop sunlight-induced skin cancers. Most people with XP also have neurological abnormalities, presumably because of their inability to repair certain lesions caused by the high rate of oxidative metabolism in neurons. Defects in the genes encoding any of at least seven different protein components of the nucleotide-excision repair system can result in XP, giving rise to seven different genetic groups, denoted XPA to XPG. Note that XPC and XPE are parts of complexes that recognize damaged DNA, whereas XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF, and XPG are all components of a much larger multisubunit complex that represents the human excinuclease depicted in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_xpLV47nr7w" id="dav_9781319322342_u6IfpOVmsm">Figure 25-24</a>. These proteins are involved in making the DNA incisions and removing the 29mer segment of DNA.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_bJ4zkcDElW">Most microorganisms have redundant pathways for the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers — making use of DNA photolyases and sometimes base-excision repair as alternatives to nucleotide-excision repair — but humans and other placental mammals do not. This lack of a backup for nucleotide-excision repair for removing pyrimidine dimers has led to speculation that early mammals were small, furry, nocturnal animals with little need to repair UV damage. However, mammals do have a pathway for the translesion bypass of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, which involves DNA polymerase <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_6rjLp2ntOt" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mi>η</mi><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="eta" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch25_03EQ_0001.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>.

Clinical manifestations of XP-V are similar to those of the classic XP diseases, although mutation levels are higher in XP-V when cells are exposed to UV light. Apparently, the nucleotide-excision repair system works in concert with DNA polymerase <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_zfPPb22a8F" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mi>η</mi><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="eta" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch25_03EQ_0003.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> in normal human cells, repairing and/or bypassing pyrimidine dimers as needed to keep cell growth and DNA replication going.

As when other DNA repair systems are absent, the resulting increase in mutations often leads to cancer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_128zlKJ4NS">One of the most common inherited cancer-susceptibility syndromes is hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). This syndrome has been traced to defects in mismatch repair.

However, about 10% of cases are associated with inherited defects in two genes, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_3y3g8xgKpL">BRCA1</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_FihpEZhFZW">BRCA2</i>.

BRCA2 has been implicated in the recombinational DNA repair of double-strand breaks. One of the key roles of BRCA2 is to load the human RecA homolog, called Rad51, onto DNA at the sites of double-strand breaks. BRCA1 has as yet imperfectly defined roles in the repair of double-strand breaks, transcription, and some other processes of DNA metabolism.

When the integrity of the genetic information is at stake, the amount of chemical energy invested in a repair process seems almost irrelevant.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_aHAcJndAye">Accurate DNA repair is possible largely because the DNA molecule consists of two complementary strands. Damaged DNA in one strand can be removed and replaced, without introducing mutations, by using the undamaged complementary strand as a template.

The top blue strand has a bond to red highlighted C H 3 near its left end. Above halfway across the molecule, the blue strand has a sharp point upward (like a triangle with no base) and the tan strand has a similar sharp point downward. This is labeled, mismatched base pair. A close-up of a piece of D N A to the right shows a top blue strand with eight short vertical lines pointing down to represent bases and a bottom tan strand with eight short vertical lines pointing up to represent bases. Positions three through six are labeled on both strands. On the top strand, positions three through six contain G, A bonded to red highlighted C H 3, T, and C. On the bottom strand, positions three through six contain C, T, A, and G. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and loss of A D P plus P subscript i end subscript. A curved line shows the addition of blue highlighted M u t S as A T P is added and a second curved line shows the addition of blue highlighted M u t L after A D P plus P I leaves. M u t S is shown as a purple oval with an oval opening near the bottom and M u t L is shown as a roughly rectangular structure with a round opening inside that extends to a narrow opening at the bottom. This yields a double-stranded piece of D N A similar to the top strand except that the two strands run through the opening in M u t S just before the mismatch and through the opening in M u t L just after the mismatch. The opening at the bottom of M u t L is closed in this illustration. This structure is labeled M u t S L complex. To the right, a teal circle labeled M u t H overlaps both strands just to the left of a bond from the blue strand to red highlighted C H 3. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and loss of A D P plus P subscript i end subscript. Blue highlighted M u t H is added at the same time as A T P. Text in a gray box to the right reads, M u t S L complex forms around the D N A at the mismatch and moves along the D N A to M u t H bound at a hemimethylated G A T C. A similar D N A molecule is shown with the mismatch to the left of the M u t S L complex. This complex now shows a purple oval with two openings, with the blue strand passing behind the left side of the top opening and out across the right side of the top opening across the upper left of M u t L to disappear behind the right side of M u t L. A teal sphere of M u t H overlaps the right side of M u t L just before a bond from the blue top strand to red highlighted C H 3 above. An arrow points down accompanied by text in a gray box reading, M u t H cleaves the unmethylated strand on the 5 prime side of G in the G A T C sequence. This yields a similar strand of D N A with a blue top strand and tan bottom strand and with a mismatched base pair in the middle. There is a cut in the tan strand just beneath the bond from the blue strand to red highlighted C H 3 above on the right.</p>

Alterations in human genes encoding proteins of this type produce some of the most common inherited cancer-susceptibility syndromes (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GpUBZNePds" id="dav_9781319322342_poi2qMnnIY">Box 25-1</a>), further demonstrating the value to the organism of DNA repair systems. The main MutS homologs in most eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, are MSH2 (MutS homolog), MSH3, and MSH6. Heterodimers of MSH2 and MSH6 generally bind to single base-pair mismatches, and they bind less well to slightly longer mispaired loops. In many organisms, the longer mismatches (2 to 6 bp) may be bound instead by a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH3, or are bound by both types of heterodimers in tandem. Homologs of MutL, predominantly a heterodimer of MLH1 (MutL homolog) and PMS1 (post-meiotic segregation), bind to and stabilize the MSH complexes. Many details of the subsequent events in eukaryotic mismatch repair remain to be worked out. In particular, we do not know how newly synthesized DNA strands are identified, although research reveals that this process does not involve GATC sequences.</p>

This glycosylase does not remove uracil residues from RNA or thymine residues from DNA. The capacity to distinguish thymine from uracil, the product of cytosine deamination — necessary for the selective repair of the latter — may be one reason why DNA evolved to contain thymine instead of uracil (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#page280" id="dav_9781319322342_32NkZXAenP">p. 280</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZLouayduN4">Most bacteria have just one type of uracil DNA glycosylase, whereas humans have at least four types, with different specificities — an indicator of the importance of removing uracil from DNA. The most abundant human uracil glycosylase, UNG, is associated with the replisome, where it eliminates the occasional U residue inserted in place of a T during replication. The deamination of C residues is 100-fold faster in single-stranded DNA than in double-stranded DNA, and humans have an enzyme, hSMUG1, that removes any U residues occurring in single-stranded DNA during replication or transcription. Two other human DNA glycosylases, TDG and MBD4, remove either U or T residues paired with G, which are generated by deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine, respectively.</p>

Glycosylases that recognize other lesions, including pyrimidine dimers, have also been identified in some classes of organisms.

Both strands begin with a blue sugar on the left bonded to a blue circle labeled P bonded to a sugar further bonded to P and so on. The sequence of bases on the top strand is G, A, C, U, G, A, C, A, and C. The sequence of bases on the bottom strand is C, T, G, G, C, T, G, T G. All of the bases are properly paired except for U, which is shown in brown with two hydrogen bonds to G below. Step 1: An arrow points down accompanied by blue highlighted text reading D N A glycosylase (uracil glycosylase) and is accompanied by a branched arrow showing the loss of a brown hexagonal U. This yields a similar molecule in which there is a gap where U had been. Step 2: An arrow points down accompanied by blue text reading, A P endonuclease. This yields a similar molecule in which the bond between sugar bound to C to the left of where U had been is no longer bonded to P bonded to the sugar that had previously been bonded to U. This creates a break in the molecule and moves the sugar and phosphate associated with U upward. Step 3: An arrow labeled blue highlighted D N A polymerase Roman numeral 1 is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of N T P s and loss of deoxyribose phosphate plus d N M Ps. This yields a similar piece of D N A in which the uracil has been replaced by a C at the fourth position from the left and the nucleotides in the further through eighth positions from the left have all been replaced by new D N A indicated by red sugars and red circles around P. There is a nick between the eighth sugar and the blue P to its right, creating an opening in the strand. Step 4: An arrow points down accompanied by blue highlighted text reading, D N A ligase. The nick is sealed and the red sugar at the eighth position from the left is now bonded to the blue circle labeled P bonded to the blue sugar at the ninth position from the left.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_8unVBiiVgG">At the top of the illustration, a double stranded D N A molecule has two blue strands. The top strand runs from 5 prime to 3 prime with vertical lines extending down to represent bases and the bottom strand runs from 3 prime to 5 prime with vertical lines extending up to represent bases. At about three-quarters of the way across the molecule, after 14 blue bases, there is a red portion in the top strand where the strand bends up diagonally, runs horizontally, and then bends down diagonally again to continue with five blue vertical bases. There is a red box beneath the horizontal piece and one red line extends from each diagonal piece. This red region is labeled D N A lesion. An arrow points downward and splits to show italicized E coli end italics on the left and human on the right. Step 1: An arrow labeled blue highlighted excinuclease points downward on the left and on the right. For the bacterium, this yields a short blue piece of D N A with eight bases, then a gap, then the ninth base bonded to a circle labeled P to the upper left, then additional bases and the lesion, then three blue bases after the lesion before another gap followed by a base bonded to a circle labeled P. For the human, the process is similar but the piece of D N A is mch longer. There is a space after the fifth base from the left, a sixth base bonded to a circle labeled P, and then the lesion begins after the twenty sixth blue base. There are four base after the lesion, then a gap, then a blue base bonded to a circle labeled P followed by a final blue base. Step 2: An arrow labeled blue highlighted D N A helicase points downward. For the bacterium, a branched arrow shows the loss of a piece of blue D N A containing the lesion with text above the lesion reading, 13 mer. There are thirteen bases in total in the piece that is removed. This results in a strand of D N A in which the eighth blue base is now bonded to O H, then there is a gap of thirteen bases, then there is a blue base bonded to a circle labeled P followed by a final blue base. For the human, a branched arrow shows the loss of a long piece containing a lesion labeled 29 mer. There are 29 bases total in the piece that is removed. This leaves a long piece of single stranded D N A. On the left, there are five bases on the top strand with the fifth base bonded to O H. On the right, the second to last base is bonded to a circle labeled P and then the strand ends with a final blue base. Step 3: Arrows point down on each side. The arrow for italicized E. coli end italics is labeled blue highlighted D N A polymerase Roman numeral 1 and this yields a similar molecule in which the missing blue nucleotides are replaced by red nucleotides with a gap remaining between the right-hand red nucleotide and the blue nucleotide on the right bonded to a circle labeled P. The arrow for humans is labeled blue highlighted D N A polymerase epsilon and also yields a similar molecule in which the missing blue nucleotides are replaced by red nucleotides with a gap remaining between the right-hand red nucleotide and the blue nucleotide on the right bonded to a circle labeled P.

The term “excinuclease” is used to describe the unique capacity of this enzyme complex to catalyze two specific endonucleolytic cleavages, distinguishing this activity from that of standard endonucleases. A dimeric UvrA protein (an ATPase) scans the DNA and binds to the site of a lesion. A UvrB protein can bind to UvrA either before or after an encounter with the lesion.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_7XyDrwXy5l">M T H F poly G l u is shown at the upper left as a left-hand six-membered ring with N substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to H, N substituted for C at the upper left vertex and bonded to H, the lower left vertex bonded to N H 2, the top vertex double bonded to O, and a double bond at the right side shared with the left side of an adjacent central six-membered ring with N substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to H, N plus substituted for C at the top vertex and double bonded to C H bonded to N that is further bonded to the left side vertex of a six-membered ring and to C H 2 tot eh lower left further bonded to the upper right vertex of the central six-membered ring. The right-hand six-membered ring has double bonds at it slower left and lower right sides and a right side vertex bonded to (C l u) subscript italicized n end italics end subscript. Step 1: A wavy yellow to red arrow labeled light points to a right-pointing arrow above text in a yellow box reading, A blue-light photon (300 to 500 n m) is absorbed by M T H F poly G l u. This yields asterisk M T H F poly G l u, which is shown within brackets as a similar molecule. Step 2: A dashed blue arrow points from asterisk M T H F poly G l u to an arrow in a cycle pointing from F A D H minus to asterisk F A D H minus. A yellow box contains accompanying text reading, The excitation energy passes to F A D H minus in the active site. A cycle of reactions is shown partly in a brown box. F A D H minus on the right side within the box is a benzene ring with its upper and lower left vertices bonded to C H 3 and a double bond at its right side shared with the left side of a central six-membered ring with N substituted for C at its bottom vertex and bonded to H, N substituted for C at its top vertex and bonded to R, and a double bond at its right side shared with the left side of a right-hand six-membered ring. This right-hand six-membered ring has N substituted for C at its lower right vertex and bonded to H, a bottom vertex double bonded to O, an upper right vertex double bonded to O, and N minus substituted for C at its top vertex. An arrow points from F A D H minus to asterisk F A D H minus at the top center of the cycle. Asterisk F A D H minus is shown in brackets and resembles F A D H minus. An arrow from asterisk F A D H minus to flavin radical F A D H dot below meets a downward arrow labeled 3 next to e minus outside of the brown box. The flavin radical resembles asterisk F A D H minus except that N substituted for C at the bottom vertex of the central ring and bonded to H has a red dot and a positive charge. An arrow points right from the flavin radical F A D H dot and is joined by an arrow showing the addition of e minus from step 5 below to form F A D H minus to continue to cycle in the brown box. Step 3 is a downward-pointing arrow /labeled by a yellow box that reads, The excited flavin (asterisk F A D H minus) donates an electron to the pyrimidine dimer to generate an unstable dimer radical. The reactant is a cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer. This has a square ring that shares its right side with the left side of a right-hand six-membered ring and its left side with the right side of a left-hand six-membered ring. The right-hand six-membered ring has N substituted for C at the upper right vertex and bonded to H, a top vertex double bonded to O, a lower right vertex double bonded to O, and N substituted for C at the bottom vertex that is further bonded below to C H bonded to C H 3 to the right and to C H 2 below bonded to a circle labeled P to the left further bonded to C H bonded to C H 2 C H 3 below and to N substituted for C at the bottom vertex of the left-hand six-membered ring. The left-hand six-membered ring also has N substitute for C at its upper left vertex and bonded to H and its lower left and top vertices double bonded to O. The arrow labeled step 3 points down accompanied by e minus from the conversion of asterisk F A D H minus to flavin radical F A D H dot to yield a similar molecule in which the left-hand six-membered ring has a top vertex with a single red dot and a bond to O minus above. Red fishhook arrows point from the red dot to the upper right side bond and from the top bond of the central square ring to the upper right bond of the left-hand ring and the upper let bond of the right-hand ring. Step 4 is an arrow pointing down from this molecule to a similar product. The product is similar except there is no top bond connecting the upper left and right vertices of the six-membered rings to form a square ring and there is a red dot at the upper left vertex of the right-hand six-membered ring. Red fishhook arrows point from the red dot to the left side of the right-hand six-membered ring and from the bond connecting the lower right vertex of the left-hand ring and the lower left vertex of the right-hand ring, which had previously been the bottom of the square ring, to the lower right vertex of the left-hand ring and the left side of the right-hand ring. Another arrow labeled 4 points to a product with two six-membered rings with no square ring between them. Step 4 is accompanied by a yellow box containing text reading, electron rearrangement restores monomeric pyrimidines. The left-hand ring has the same structure as before except that there is a red dot at the lower right vertex instead of a bond. The right-hand ring has a double bond at its left side. Red fishhook arrows point from the red dot and from the double bond at the upper right side to the right side of the left-hand ring. A red arrow points from O minus to the bond between O minus and the top vertex of the left-hand ring. Step 5: An arrow points right to show that this yields monomeric pyrimidines in repaired D N A and an arrow branches away from this arrow showing that e minus joins with an arrow from flavin radical F A D H dot to form F A D H minus. The monomeric pyrimidines in repaired D N A are similar to the reactants except that the left-hand ring has a double bond at its right side and a double bond from it stop vertex to O.</p>

Guanine has a five-membered ring on the left with N substituted for C at the top vertex at position 7, N substituted for C at the lower left vertex at position 9 and further bonded to R, a double bond between C 7 and C 8, and a double bond between C 4 and C 5 shared with a six-membered ring to the right.

Cytosine is a six-membered ring with N substituted for C at the lower right vertex at position 1 and bonded to R, C 2 at the lower left vertex double bonded to O, N substituted for C at the left side vertex at position 3, C 4 at the upper left vertex bonded to N H 2, and double bonds between C 3 and C 4 and between C 5 and C 6. There are double bonds between O double bonded to C 6 of guanine and H bonded to N bonded to position 4 of cytosine, between H bonded to N at position 1 of guanine and N at position 3 of cytosine, and between H bonded to N bonded to position 2 of guanine and O double bonded to C 2 of cytosine. An arrow points down labeled methylation and replication. This yields O superscript 6 end superscript-methylguanine connected by two hydrogen bonds to thymine. O superscript 6 end superscript-methylguanine resembles guanine except that C 6 double bonded to O is bonded to O red highlighted C H 3 instead, N at position 1 is not bonded to H, and there is a double bond between C 1 and C 6. Thymine has N substituted for C at the lower right vertex at position 1 and bonded to R, C 2 at the lower left vertex double bonded to O, N substituted for C at the left side vertex at position 3, C 4 at the upper left vertex double bonded to O, C 5 at the upper right vertex bonded to C H 3, and a double bond between C 5 and C 6.

Part b shows a vertical double-stranded D N A molecule with a tan strand on the left and a blue strand on the right. Halfway along the molecule, G on the left is hydrogen bonded to C on the right. An arrow points right labeled methylation. This yields a similar molecule in which G is bonded to red highlighted C H 3 to the left. An arrow points down labeled replication. This yields a short blue vertical double-stranded piece of D N A that splits into left and right halves that have blue parent strands and tan daughter strands. The left half shows G in the blue strand bonded to red highlighted C H 3 to the left and hydrogen bonded to T in the tan strand to the right. The right half shows G in the tan strand hydrogen bonded to C in the blue strand. Arrows labeled replication point down from each one. The downward right-hand arrow from the right-hand daughter molecule points to text reading, correctly paired D N A (n o mutations). The left-hand arrow splits to show that two blue vertical molecules of D N A are produced.

The lesion remains in an unreplicated, single-stranded gap that is left behind the replication fork (left). In other cases, a replication fork may encounter a lesion that is actively undergoing repair such that a transient break is present in one of the template strands. When the replication fork encounters it, the single-strand break becomes a double-strand break (right). In each case, the damage to one strand cannot be repaired by mechanisms described earlier in this chapter, because the complementary strand required to direct accurate repair is damaged or absent. There are at least two possible avenues for repair: recombinational DNA repair or, when lesions are unusually numerous, error-prone repair. The latter mechanism involves translesion DNA polymerases such as DNA polymerase V, encoded by the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_N9kEOdqtEq">umuC</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_pJxIiYz7Vl">umuD</i> genes and activated by the RecA protein that can replicate, albeit inaccurately, over many types of lesions.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_QVbOPm5TFY">What emerges from research into cellular DNA repair systems is a picture of a DNA metabolism that maintains genomic integrity with multiple and often redundant systems. Most of the major DNA repair systems occur in all organisms. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_mQ1GUaLUeP" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> These repair systems are often integrated with the DNA replication systems and are complemented by recombination systems, which we turn to next.</p>
