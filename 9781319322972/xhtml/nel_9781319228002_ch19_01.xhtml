<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_OAPtqjqE9d">Oxidative phosphorylation is the culmination of energy-yielding metabolism (catabolism) in aerobic organisms. All oxidative steps in the degradation of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids converge at this final stage of cellular respiration, in which the energy of oxidation drives the synthesis of ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation accounts for most of the ATP synthesized by nonphotosynthetic organisms under most circumstances. In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in mitochondria and involves huge protein complexes embedded in the mitochondrial membranes. The pathway to ATP synthesis in mitochondria challenged and fascinated biochemists for much of the twentieth century. Our current exploration of the topic is guided by five principles:</p>

Mitochondria play host to the citric acid cycle, the fatty acid <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_s6BvYQzNJS">β</i>-oxidation pathway, and the pathways of amino acid oxidation. The mitochondria also act in thermogenesis, steroid synthesis, and apoptosis (programmed cell death). The discovery of these diverse and important roles of mitochondria has stimulated much current research on the biochemistry of this organelle.</p></li>

This electrochemical potential drives ATP synthesis by a membrane-bound enzyme (ATP synthase) that is fundamentally similar in mitochondria and chloroplasts, and in bacteria and archaea as well.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_b8gw21l1fx">An oval mitochondrion is shown. The outer boundary is labeled inner mitochondrial membrane and contains four electron carriers across the top and an A T P synthase at the bottom center. Plus signs and red highlighted H plus ions are shown around the outside of the membrane, whereas negative signs are shown along the inner boundary of the membrane. The electron carriers (respiratory chain) include a pink structure on the left with an upper horizontal portion that bends down to an oval portion inside. To its right, a beige structure has a vertical portion that crosses the membrane and a rounded portion below the membrane. To its right, a red horizontal upward arrow points from H plus below the membrane to H plus outside of the membrane. To its right, an irregular, wide blue structure has a roughly rectangular piece outside of the membrane that narrows at it passes through the membrane, then two protrusions to the left and right beneath the membrane, then a wider base with an invagination at the bottom center. To its right, there is a roughly rectangular light green structure that has a bump at the top center and a triangular invagination at the bottom. Step 1: Reduced substrate (fuel) donates e minus. A reduced e minus donor provides an electron that enters the pink left-hand structure of the chain of four electron carriers. Step 2: Electron carriers pump H plus as electrons flow to O 2. This is represented by the red horizontal upward arrow showing the movement of H plus across the membrane in the middle of the electron carriers, between structures two and three. An arrow shows that O 2 (e minus acceptor) leaves from the green structure at the right end of the respiratory chain. Step 3: Energy of e minus flow is stored as electrochemical potential. A T P synthase is shown with a rectangular portion across the bottom center of the membrane with a stalk up to a rounded portion above consisting of three joined ovals with a thin tubular portion that exits from its top center and curves right to run down along the right side of the A T P synthase to cross the membrane below. A red arrow begins at H plus beneath A T P synthase, below the membrane, and runs vertically through the right half of the rectangular piece in the membrane before bending right across the thin tubular portion to point to H plus inside the membrane. To the upper left of A T P synthase, a curved arrow runs from A D P plus P I through the left side of the rounded top portion of A T P synthase to an orange oval labeled A T P to the lower left of A T P synthase. This A T P is still above the bottom membrane. Step 4: A T P synthase uses electrochemical potential to synthesize A T P.</p>

Mitochondria are central to neuronal and muscular function, and to the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism and body weight. Human neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer, diabetes, and obesity, are recognized as possible results of compromised mitochondrial function, and one theory of aging is based on gradual loss of mitochondrial integrity. We consider the diverse functions of mitochondria, and the consequences of defective mitochondrial function in humans. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_pSgur7ulhI" role="presentation" src="../images/square4.png"/></p>
