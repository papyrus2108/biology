<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_hf5uuJpSDN">Protein function can be described on three levels. <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_xyxDWSyPk6">Phenotypic function</strong> describes the effects of a protein on the entire organism. For example, loss of the protein may lead to slower growth of the organism, an altered development pattern, or even death. <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_cD7Hf3hyh8">Cellular function</strong> is a description of the network of interactions a protein engages in at the cellular level. Identifying interactions with other proteins in the cell can help define the kinds of metabolic processes in which the protein participates. Finally, <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Xfn3xLFWly">molecular function</strong> refers to the precise biochemical activity of a protein, including details such as the reactions that an enzyme catalyzes or the ligands that a receptor binds. In response to the challenge of understanding these functions of the thousands of proteins in a typical cell, scientists have developed a variety of techniques in the broader discipline of genomics. We can apply these techniques to determine when a particular protein is expressed, what other proteins it might be related to, where it is located in the cell, what other cellular components it interacts with, and what happens to the cell when the protein is missing.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_KHv1ylGYj4">Using online tools that apply computational power to comparative genomics, scientists can define gene locations and assign tentative gene functions (where possible) based on similarity to genes previously studied in other genomes. The classic BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm allows a rapid search of all genome databases for sequences related to one that a researcher is exploring, and it is especially valuable for investigating the function of a particular gene.

These relationships are determined with the aid of sophisticated computer programs, limited only by the current information on gene and protein structure and by our capacity to associate sequences with particular structural motifs. Sequences at an enzyme active site that have been highly conserved during evolution are typically associated with catalytic function, and their identification is often a key step in defining an enzyme’s reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism, in turn, provides information needed to develop new enzyme inhibitors that can be used as pharmaceutical agents.</p>

Because many RNAs, particularly mRNAs and rRNAs, are quite long, the RNA is then fragmented to an average size commensurate with the DNA sequencing platform to be used. The RNA is converted to DNA using reverse transcriptase. Hexameric DNA oligonucleotides of random sequence are used to prime the reverse transcriptase if all RNA is to be included in the transcriptome. RNA-DNA hybrids are more stable than DNA-DNA hybrids, so hexameric duplexes are sufficient for this task. If the transcriptome is focused on expression of protein-coding genes, beads coated with poly(dT) can be used to hybridize to the poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs, allowing their precipitation and enrichment relative to other RNAs. After reverse transcription, the DNA fragments are ligated to duplex adapters that provide a universal priming location for the DNA sequencing as well as sequences that allow annealing to anchors on the sequencing flow cell (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vwzQHqpVkw" id="dav_9781319322342_AOEO2R65ua">Fig. 8-36</a>).

For example, a protein found exclusively in the nucleus could be involved in processes that are unique to that organelle, such as transcription, replication, or chromatin condensation. Researchers often engineer fusion proteins for the purpose of locating a protein in the cell or organism.

The N H is bonded to C that is double bonded to O extending from S e r below that is further bonded below. A red arrow points from the red highlighted pair of electrons on N to the C double bonded to O of S e r, and another red arrow points from the double bond of O of S e r to H plus to the right.

Identifying the associated proteins reveals some of the intracellular protein-protein interactions of the tagged protein. There are many variations of this process. For example, a crude extract of cells that express a tagged protein is added to a column containing immobilized antibody (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6hpiJ5l8On" id="dav_9781319322342_uVKKY7uU7p">Fig. 3-17c</a> for a description of affinity chromatography). The tagged protein binds to the antibody, and proteins that interact with the tagged protein are sometimes also retained on the column. The connection between the protein and the tag is cleaved with a specific protease. The protein complexes are eluted from the column, and the proteins in them are <span aria-label="321" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page321" role="doc-pagebreak"/>identified by mass spectrometry. Researchers can use these methods to define complex networks of interactions within a cell. In principle, the chromatographic approach to analyzing protein-protein interactions can be used with any type of protein tag (His tag, GST, etc.) that can be immobilized on a suitable chromatographic medium.</p>

The only cells that grow on the selective medium, or that produce the appropriate color, are those in which the gene of interest is binding to a partner, allowing transcription of the reporter gene.

An investigator can then examine how the genomic alteration affects cell growth or function. The methods available to modify genomes grow more sophisticated every year. The most common approach is to cut the gene of interest at a site that is functionally critical, generating a double-strand break. In eukaryotes, such breaks are most commonly repaired by cellular systems that promote nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a process described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_M2wsSgc1Dh">Chapter 25</a>. NHEJ seals the double-strand break, but the process is imprecise. Nucleotides are often deleted or added during the repair, inactivating the gene. In bacteria, introduced double-strand breaks are usually repaired more accurately, by homologous recombination systems (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_itKJKTZaWo">Chapter 25</a>), but inactivating mutations can appear. Many traditional approaches to targeting a gene in this way were supplanted by the advent of CRISPR/Cas systems in 2011.</p>

The sgRNA has a region complementary to the chosen genomic target sequence (purple); this region can be engineered to include any desired sequence. A complex consisting of the CRISPR sgRNA and the Cas9 protein forms within the cell and binds to the chosen target site in the DNA. The structure of the bound complex is shown in (b). In the pathway shown on the left in (a), two nuclease active sites in the Cas9 protein separately cleave each DNA strand in the target, producing a double-strand break. The double-strand break is usually repaired by nonhomologous end joining, which generally deletes or alters the nucleotides at the site where joining occurs. Alternatively, as shown in the pathway on the right, if one nuclease site is inactivated, Cas9 nuclease activity creates a single-strand break in the target sequence. In the presence of a recombination donor DNA fragment, identical to the target sequence but incorporating the desired sequence change (fragment shown in red), homologous DNA recombination will sometimes change the sequence at the site of the break to match that of the donor DNA. <span class="attribution" id="dav_9781319322342_XXHJwGFihT">[Data from PDB ID 4UN3, C.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_7zCx5r3DrB">Part a is divided into three sections. The top section is separated from the middle section by a double horizontal band representing a cell wall. The middle section is labeled cytosol, and a dotted horizontal line separates it from the nucleus at the bottom. At the top, outside the cell, is a circular plasmid labeled C R I S PR/CAS 9 plasmid. Almost the entire top half is yellow. There is a green segment from the 3 o’clock position to the 4 o’clock position, then a small blue piece followed by a very small green piece between the 4 and 5 o’clock positions, then a yellow piece and a pink piece from the 5 o’clock to 6 o’clock positions, then a purple piece from the 6 o’clock position to about halfway between the 6 and 7 o’clock positions, then a gray piece that runs to the 10 o’clock position to meet the large yellow piece that forms the top portion. This is added to a small curved piece labeled recombination fragment that has a red segment in the middle. An arrow points down through the cell wall accompanied by text that reads, plasmid and fragment introduced into cell by electroporation. The arrow continues through the cytosol into the nucleus. The plasmid is shown in the nucleus. An arrow points down accompanied by text reading, plasmid directs synthesis of C R I S P R/Cas 9 complex. A horizontal double stranded D N A molecule is shown below with a highlighted segment on both strands on the far right labeled chosen target sequence. The central region of the D N A is separated to form a bubble. Above the top half of the bubble, there is a horizontal green strand labeled lowercase s g uppercase R N A. On the left side of the strand, there is a purple segment labeled lowercase s g uppercase R N A target-seeking sequence. On the right side, the strand forms a loop and extends back to the left behind a piece of a large molecule which is shown surrounding the D N A bubble and associated structures. The green bends downward and then forms a loop to the right behind the D N A bubble, then forms another loop behind and beneath the D N A bubble, then extends vertically downward to emerge from the large molecule to form one more loop and then extend a short distance upward before ending. The large molecule has a irregular gray oval piece on top, mostly above the D N A but extending behind it on the right side. This joins to a curved gray oval that runs behind the right half of the bubble and curves to the left beneath it. Its left side meets a purple rounded structure with two protrusions on the right side, one in and one below the D N A bubble, and a slight invagination on the left side behind the lower strand of D N A. A pink irregular oval runs behind the top strand of D N A over the purple structure and extends upward above the lowercase s g uppercase R N A about halfway across the main irregular gray oval piece. The center of the pink structure is behind the purple segment labeled lowercase s g uppercase R N A target-seeking sequence. The pink and purple structures are labeled nuclease active domains. An arrow points down accompanied by text reading, C R I S P R/Cas 9 complex scans genome for target sequence. Two possible products are shown, one representing a double-strand break and one representing a single-strand break. The double-strand break produces a structure similar to the one above except that the bubble of D N A now has the highlighted target sequence lined up beneath the purple lowercase s g uppercase R N A target-seeking sequence. On both strands, the highlighted target sequences are broken evenly in the middle. An arrow points down to show the D N A with the bubble and the break in the middle of the target sequence on the top and bottom strands. An arrow points down accompanied by text reading, nonhomologous end joining leads to gene mutation. A horizontal piece of double stranded D N A is shown with the highlighted target sequence near the middle and a small yellow piece in the middle of the target sequence on both the top and bottom strands. The product of the single-strand break is similar to the product of the double-strand break except that the target sequence remains intact on the bottom strand and the purple rounded structure is labeled inactivated nuclease domain. An arrow points down and the recombination fragment is added. The D N A bubble is shown again with the break in the target D N A on the top strand. The recombination fragment is shown horizontally placed above the broken target sequence with its red segment in the middle. On each side of the red segment of the recombination fragment and of the target sequence in D N A, there is an X connecting the recombination fragment with the D N A. An arrow points down accompanied by text reading, recombination with added fragment leads to homology-directed repair. A horizontal double-stranded piece of D N A is shown with red segments on the top and bottom strands replacing the target sequence segments. Part b shows a model of the C R I S P R/Cas 9 complex, D N A, and lowercase s g uppercase R N A. The D N A is shown as a double helix running diagonally from a bumpy pink oblong oval on the lower left to the center before bending and extending horizontally to the right out of the molecule. The chosen target sequence of the D N A is indicated in the D N A within the pink oblong oval. There is a bumpy white piece of the C R I S P R/Cas 9 complex above the pink structure that curves up and around, down the right side, and back behind the horizontal D N A before curving toward the center. Beneath the pink oval, there is a bumpy purple rounded structure that extends downward and contacts the white C R I S P R/Cas 9 on the right. A tiny piece of purple is visible on the bottom far right emerging behind the large white complex. There is a small space between the purple structure and the white complex where the D N A emerges horizontally. The pink and purple structures are labeled nuclease active domains. A green piece of lowercase s g uppercase R N A begins vertically where the purple and white structures come together, then bends to run diagonally toward the upper right just above where the D N A emerges horizontally.</p>

For mammalian cells, the genes encoding the CRISPR/Cas9 components can be incorporated into engineered viruses that subsequently deliver them to the cell nuclei. For many organisms, the targeted gene is inactivated in a high percentage of the treated cells. If a genomic change (mutation) rather than a simple gene inactivation is required, it can be introduced by recombination when a DNA fragment encompassing the cleavage site and including the desired change enters the cell with the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids. This recombination is often inefficient, but success can be improved somewhat by introducing a nick rather than a double-strand break at the target site (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_OPZfoi8VnC" id="dav_9781319322342_1qL2mPwxQZ">Fig. 9-21</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ds5YQjiQLe">Invasive introduced plant and animal species can wreak havoc on any natural environment, and can also spread human disease. Mosquitoes that harbor Zika virus and other diseases in many parts of the world, introduced rats on almost every continent, cane toads and rabbits in Australia, the kudzu vine in the southern United States—represent just a few examples of invasive species that cause human misery and annual financial damage totaling billions of dollars. Traditional methods of control such as poisoning or trapping are often unsuccessful and can have detrimental effects on native species that become unintended targets.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9x7enSRV2d">The discovery of selfish DNA elements such as homing endonucleases and transposons that can spread through a population gave rise to the concept of <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_qwhn34hAlE">gene drives</strong> as a new approach to the control of invasive species. The most recent and promising iteration of this idea involves synthetic gene drives based on CRISPR/Cas9. The overall idea is to set up a system that skews the male to female ratio in a target species far away from the favored 1:1, resulting in population collapse. A strategy called X shredder, already proven in the laboratory with mosquitoes, is highlighted in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_wsrfTHD4vZ" id="dav_9781319322342_K8Vy1Js1qs">Figure 1</a>. A cassette that includes genes expressing Cas9, as well as several sgRNAs targeted to different unique sites on the X chromosome, is inserted into an intergenic region on the Y chromosome. The cassette is engineered into males, and is controlled by a gene regulatory system that is expressed only during spermatogenesis. Thus, during spermatogenesis, the cassette is expressed so that the X chromosome is cleaved at multiple locations, basically destroying it. This ensures that the only viable sperm have Y chromosomes. All the offspring of any cross with a female are all males, and all of them possess Y chromosomes containing the X-shredder cassette. When those male offspring mate with other females later, the same result ensues. As these males mate and spread the cassette through the population, a dearth of females occurs and the population collapses. In principle, this same strategy could be applied to rats, cane toads, and many other invasive species.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8xf2eOU1j3">To date, gene drives have been restricted to the laboratory. The potential for a gene drive escaping to species that are not intended targets is not yet clear. Resistance in the target species could occur by mutating the sgRNA target sites, although the use of multiple sites makes this less likely. The gene drive approach is a good illustration of the power and potential of CRISPR. However, once males with a gene drive are released, it would be essentially impossible to call a halt to the effects. Nature has a way of imposing consequences, both unintended and unexpected. The potential positive effects on health and agriculture continue to drive research to improve the technology and address potential problems.</p>

Libraries of sgRNAs have been generated to target virtually all genes in a mammalian genome, or specialized subsets of them. The targeting sequence in each sgRNA is 20 bp long. In addition to targeting a particular gene, each targeting sequence acts as a kind of unique bar code identifier that is readily recognized by computer programs after sequencing. The sgRNAs are packaged in a DNA cassette set up to also express the Cas9 protein or a Cas9 variant. The cassettes are incorporated into carefully engineered lentiviral vectors derived from HIV (with genes required for HIV multiplication eliminated). The viral vectors deliver the cassette to the nucleus as a single-stranded RNA, convert it to double-stranded <span aria-label="325" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page325" role="doc-pagebreak"/>DNA with the viral-encoded reverse transcriptase, and integrate the DNA into a chromosome.

The vectors infect cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) small enough so that most cells will gain only one vector. The vector RNA is converted to DNA and integrated into the genome.

RNA-Seq provides information on what genes are being expressed in a cell. Mass spectrometry can define cellular proteomes. By fusing a gene of interest with genes that encode green fluorescent protein or epitope tags, researchers can visualize the cellular location of the gene product, either directly or by immunofluorescence.</li>
