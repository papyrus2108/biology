An alternative process for double-strand break repair that does not entail recombination, called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Zx56tNwUzo">nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)</strong>, is also described here. Genetic recombination systems have functions as varied as their mechanisms. They include roles in specialized DNA repair systems, specialized activities in DNA replication, regulation of expression of certain genes, facilitation of proper chromosome segregation during eukaryotic cell division, maintenance of genetic diversity, and implementation of programmed genetic rearrangements during embryonic development. In most cases, genetic recombination is closely integrated with other processes in DNA metabolism, and this becomes a theme of our discussion.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_aa7v4bPKmM">A figure shows blue double-stranded D N A with a replication fork on the left side. The top blue strand runs from 3 prime to 5 prime and the bottom blue strand runs from 5 prime to 3 prime. At the replication fork, a continuous orange arrow points from its 5 prime end into the replication fork beneath the top strand and a series of two small orange arrows point from the replication fork toward the 3 prime end of the second arrow. There is a small gap in the top blue strand to the right of the replication fork labeled D N A nick. An arrow pointing down is labeled replication fork collapse. This yields two sets of double-stranded D N A. The top piece has a short blue piece that runs from the 3 prime end on the left to the right, where it is labeled double-strand break. Beneath it, an orange arrow runs from its 5 prime end to end beneath the end of the blue piece. Below, a longer blue strand runs from a 5 prime end on the left toward the right. Above it, a blue piece extends left to meet an orange arrow that points left to meet a short orange piece that ends at its 3 prime end. Step 1: 5 prime-end processing. An arrow points down to show the same two molecules as below. The top molecule has become shorter with a short arrow pointing left in place of its right end. The bottom molecule is unchanged. Step 2: Strand invasion: An arrow points down to show that the orange top strand of the bottom double-stranded D N A molecule has bent upward to overlap the right end of the orange bottom strand of the top double-stranded D N A molecule. This orange strand becomes blue an bends back down to meet its complementary bottom strand, which bends up to meet it to form a parallel double-stranded D N A molecule at the right. Step 3: Branch migration. A close-up shows two components, then an arrow points down to show the product. The top half of the close-up shows a top molecule with a horizontal orange strand below with a blue strand above that runs to three-quarters of the way across the orange strand, then bends diagonally down to run along the right end of a horizontal blue strand below that forms the bottom half of the bottom D N A molecule. An orange strand running above the bottom blue strand of the bottom molecule bends upward at three-quarters of the way across the blue strand to intercept the blue strand bending downward, then runs horizontally above the right end of the orange strand that forms the bottom half of the top molecule. It is briefly orange, then becomes blue as it runs above the orange horizontal strand that forms the bottom half of the top molecule. An arrow points down to show a similar structure labeled Holliday intermediate in which the interactions between the strands have shifted to the left. The top molecule still has a horizontal orange strand at the bottom. It has a short blue strand at the upper left that then bends down diagonally and then bends again to run horizontally along most of the top of the bottom molecule. The orange strand that begins at the top of the bottom double-stranded D N A molecule bends upward to cross the blue strand that is angled downward and then runs horizontally above the horizontal orange strand of the top molecule before turning blue at its right end. The arrow labeled 3 points down to show that the short top blue strand of the top double-stranded D N A molecule has bend downward to run diagonally to the lower right and then run parallel along the blue bottom D N A strand of the bottom molecule. The orange top strand of the bottom molecule has shifted so that it bends upward near the left end, instead of far to the right, and then runs above the orange bottom strand of the top molecule before turning blue bending back down to rejoin its complementary strand. Step 4: Holliday intermediate resolution and ligation. An arrow points down to show a molecule with blue double stranded D N A on the right that branches to form a fork to the left. The top half of the fork has a top strand that begins at a blue 3 prime end, rapidly becomes orange, and then becomes blue shortly before bending down to meet the complementary strand of the double-stranded part at the right side. The lower strand of the top half of the fork is an orange arrow that points from its five prime end at the left to end just beneath the end of the orange part of the strand above. The top strand of the lower half of the fork has a short orange piece that begins at its 3 prime end and then joins a short blue piece. The bottom strand of the lower half of the fork begins at its five prime end and runs right until it bends up to join the complementary strand from above to form a double-stranded molecule to the right of the fork.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_B5TAZxAk9s">Part a a roughly spherical structure is made of many parts. It has a green part at the top with two lobes labeled Rec D 5 prime to 3 prime helicase. It has a purple roughly rectangular piece to the right labeled Rec B nuclease. It has a tan roughly half-circle piece at the lower right. It has a large half-circle at the lower left running from the six o’clock to nine o’clock positions that is purple and labeled Rec B 5 prime to 3 prime helicase. It has a small tan piece that is wider on the left with protrusions to the upper left and right located at the upper left adjacent the green part and labeled Rec C. Tan pieces run diagonally from Rec C at the upper left to an oblong piece at the lower right. Incoming double-stranded D N A is shown entering just below the vertical midpoint along the top of the purple piece at the lower left. It reaches a tan oval labeled pin as it separates into upper and lower strands. The upper strand runs along the left side of the pin and through an opening between tan pieces, then runs right across the bottom of the green piece to end at its 5 prime end, where it is labeled outgoing 5 prime single-stranded D N A. The bottom strand runs down along the purple piece and then bends up through an opening between two tan pieces to exit between Rec B nuclease and the tan piece at the lower right at its 3 prime end. Accompanying text reads, outgoing single-stranded D N A. Part b shows the activity of the Rec B C D enzyme. At the top, a horizontal piece of D N A is shown with a short, single-stranded red region in the center labeled C h i. The right end of the molecule crosses a purple oval angled from upper left to lower right labeled Rec B t prime to 3 prime helicase. The two strands of the D N A molecule separate around a round tan structure labeled pin right beneath a long tan piece labeled Rec C that begins at the upper left and runs tot eh lower right, beyond the end of the purple oval below. The top strand of D N A runs across the tan region and beneath a green circle labeled Rec D 5 prime to 3 prime helicase and to end at its 5 prime end above a purple oval labeled Rec B nuclease domain. An arrow points downward accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and the loss of A D P plus P subscript I end subscript. This yields a similar structure in which the red region labeled C h I has moved up to the upper left edge of the lower purple oval labeled Rec B 5 prime to 3 prime helicase. The top strand of D N A now extends past the purple oval labeled Rec B nuclease domain and this end is now broken into three smaller pieces. The lower stand has become a dotted line beginning when it leaves the purple oval and enters the tan region until it ends at its 3 prime end to the lower right. A gray arrow points from the 5 prime end of this D N A strand left to the small purple oval representing the Rec B nuclease domain. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and loss of A D P plus P i. Accompanying text in a gray box reads, Rec B and Rec D helicase activities unwind D N A; the Rec B nuclease activity degrades both strands of D N A. This yields a similar structure in which the red piece labeled C h I is now in s a single stranded piece of D N A to the lower right of the pin on the bottom D N A strand. The top D N A strand now has extended further to the right and has been divided into seven pieces. A longer gray arrow points from the end of this strand tot the purple oval representing Rec B nuclease domain. The bottom strand is also longer and is still a dashed line from the time it leaves the purple oval representing Rec B 5 prime to 3 prime helicase until it reaches its 3 prime end. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and the loss of A D P plus P i. Accompanying gray text reads, C h I sequence is bound by Rec C, preventing further degradation of the 3 prime-ending strand. The enzyme continues to unwind and degrade the 5 prime-ending strand. This yields a similar structure in which the bottom strand folds to form a loop to the left with C h I remaining in the same place on the purple oval with a small white piece to its right extending to the tan portion. The dashed line representing the right end of this strand is now pale and separated from the enzyme. The top stand now has ten pieces and a slightly longer arrow pointing from its five prime end to the purple oval. An arrow points down and is joined by a curved line showing the addition of a green oval labeled Rec A. Accompanying text in a gray box reads, As the exposed are on the 3 prime-ending strand lengthens, Rec B C D facilitates locating of the Rec A recombinase. This yields a structure in which the main enzyme is visible to the left with a top strand of D N A emerging at the top of the purple oval and the bottom strand of D N A emerging across the tan region to a strand with a line of seven adjacent green ovals before ending with a small blue piece and then a red piece labeled C h i. The green ovals are angled slightly from lower left to upper right.</p>

Each replicated double-stranded DNA molecule is called a chromatid (sister chromatid). In prophase I, just before the first meiotic division, the two homologous sets of chromatids align to form tetrads, held together by covalent links at homologous junctions (chiasmata). Crossovers occur within the chiasmata (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_T6dTtuEXFL" id="dav_9781319322342_PlOz8GYtzL">Fig. 25-34</a>). These transient associations between homologs ensure that the two tethered chromosomes segregate properly in the next step, when attached spindle fibers pull them toward opposite poles of the dividing cell in the first meiotic division. The products of this division are two daughter cells, each with two pairs of different sister chromatids. The pairs now line up across the equator of the cell in preparation for separation of the chromatids (now called chromosomes). The second meiotic division produces four haploid daughter cells that can serve as gametes. Each has two chromosomes, half the number of the diploid germ-line cell.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AlHrjiw1GL">Meiosis begins with replication of the DNA in the germ-line cell so that each DNA molecule is present in four copies. Each set of four homologous chromosomes (tetrad) exists as two pairs of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres. The cell then goes through two rounds of cell division without an intervening round of DNA replication. In the first cell division, the two pairs of sister chromatids are segregated into daughter cells. In the second cell division, the two chromosomes in each sister chromatid pair are segregated into new daughter cells. In each division, the chromosomes to be segregated are drawn into the daughter cells by spindle fibers attached to opposite poles of the dividing cell. The two successive divisions reduce the DNA content to the haploid level in each gamete.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_GwECFTu3Rr">Proper chromosome segregation into daughter cells requires that physical links exist between the homologous chromosomes to be segregated. As the spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of chromosomes and start to pull, the links between homologous chromosomes create tension. This tension, sensed by cellular mechanisms not yet understood, signals that this pair of chromosomes or sister chromatids is properly aligned for segregation. Once the tension is sensed, the links are gradually dissolved and segregation proceeds. If improper spindle fiber attachment occurs (e.g., if the centromeres of a chromosome pair are attached to the same cellular pole), a cellular kinase senses the lack of tension and activates a system that removes the spindle attachments, allowing the cell to try again.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_YAF5RPHtzl">During the second meiotic division, the centromeric attachments between sister chromatids, augmented by cohesins deposited during replication (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_7PTDPF1DaW" id="dav_9781319322342_QFMpLSQP3c">Fig. 24-33</a>), provide the physical links that are needed to guide segregation. However, during the first meiotic cell division, the two pairs of sister chromatids to be segregated are not related by a recent replication event and are not linked by cohesins or any other physical association. Instead, the homologous pairs of sister chromatids are aligned and new links are created by recombination, a process involving the breakage and rejoining of DNA (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_3y29NLvbQg"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_T6dTtuEXFL" id="dav_9781319322342_sWBpkzfca4">Fig. 25-34</a></strong>). <span aria-label="945" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page945" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span aria-label="946" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page946" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This exchange, also referred to as crossing over, can be observed with the light microscope. Crossing over links the two pairs of sister chromatids together at points called chiasmata (singular, chiasma). Also during crossing over, genetic material is exchanged between the pairs of sister chromatids. These exchanges increase genetic diversity in the resulting gametes. The importance of meiotic recombination to proper chromosome segregation is well illustrated by the physiological and societal consequences of their failure (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_bD2VuAjOrn"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_PCCL6A2wDL" id="dav_9781319322342_CeAfX086RG">Box 25-2</a></strong>).</p>

The two homologous chromosomes (one shown in red, the other blue) involved in this recombination event have identical or very nearly identical sequences. Each of the two genes shown has different alleles on the two chromosomes. The steps are described in the text. (b) Crossing over occurs during prophase of meiosis I. The several stages of prophase I are aligned with the recombination processes shown in (a). Double-strand breaks are introduced and processed in the leptotene stage. The strand invasion and completion of crossover occur later. As homologous sequences in the two pairs of sister chromatids are aligned in the zygotene stage, synaptonemal complexes form and strand invasion occurs. The homologous chromosomes are tightly aligned by the pachytene stage. (c) Homologous chromosomes of a grasshopper, viewed at successive stages of meiotic prophase I.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_NEZQ39YBUN">Two double-stranded pieces of D N A are shown. The top two pieces are orange and divided into left and right halves. Both top orange stands run from 5 prime to 3 prime and both bottom orange strands run from 3 prime to 5 prime. Short red bars near the left of the left-hand pieces are labeled gene A and similar short red bars near the end of the right-hand pieces are labeled gene B. The bottom double-stranded piece of D N A is blue and has short blue bars in similar positions on the left and right sides of each strand. Step 1: A double-strand break in one of two homologs is converted to a double-strand gap by the action of exonucleases. Strands with 3 prime ends are degraded less than those with 5 prime ends, producing 3 prime single-stranded extensions. An arrow points down to show that the orange strands are now shorter while the blue strands have stayed the same. The upper left orange strand is longer than the lower left orange strand and the upper right orange strand is shorter than the lower right orange strand. Step 2: An exposed 3 prime end pairs with its complement in the intact homolog. The other strand of the duplex is displaced. An arrow points down to show that this yields a similar structure in which the bottom orange strand has bent down about halfway across its length and then bent again to run horizontally above the lower blue strand of the double-stranded blue molecule below. Above this region, the top blue strand has angled up to the left and right with a horizontal piece connecting the two angled pieces. Step 3: The invading 3 prime end is extended by D N A polymerase plus branch migration, eventually, after a second end-capture event, generating a D N A molecule with two crossovers in the form of branched structures called Holliday intermediates. An arrow points down to show that this yields a structure in which the top two orange pieces are the same, the lower left orange piece has angled down toward the bottom blue piece, and the lower right orange piece has angled down and bent to run diagonally across the center of the bottom blue piece. The right-hand piece of this orange piece is orange, but the center and left of this orange piece are now purple. The top blue strand has angled upward near its ends to produce a long horizontal piece above that runs between the left and right pieces of the bottom orange strand above. Step 4: Further D N A replication replaces the D NA missing from the site of the original double-strand break. An arrow points down to show that this yields two molecules, one on the left and one on the right. The left-hand molecule has a top strand that has a red copy of gene A near its left end, a purple region in the center and center right, and a red copy of gene B near its right end. The second orange stand still has genes A and B in the same positions, but both sides angle down to meet a horizontal piece that runs along the bottom blue piece of the double-stranded blue molecule below. The left and center part of this horizontal piece of the bottom orange strand is purple. The bottom blue strand is horizontal and unchanged. The upper blue strand angles upward on the left and right to cross the orange strands angling downward and runs horizontally beneath the top strand between these crossovers. Arrows point to the crossovers of the orange and blue strands from the left and from the right. The right-hand structure is similar except that arrows point up and down at the left-hand crossover and from the right and left to the right-hand crossover. Step 5: Specialized nucleases called Holliday intermediate resolvases cleave the Holliday intermediate, generating either of two recombination products. In product set 2, the D N A on either side of the region undergoing repair is recombined. Arrows point down from the left- and right-hand products. The arrow from the left-hand product produces two products labeled product set 1. The first product is a double-stranded structure with red genes A and B still present int their original locations. The top strand is orange except for a purple region in the center to center right. The bottom strand is orange except for a blue region that runs through most of the center. The second double-stranded structure has sets of blue genes at the left and right sides as in the original molecule. The bottom strand is entirely blue. The top strand is blue on the left, then there is a purple region from the center left to center, then there is a small orange region, and then there is a blue region at the right end. The arrow from the right-hand product produces two double-stranded structures labeled product set 2. The top product is a double-stranded structure with blue genes near the left ends of both strands and red copies of gene B in the same locations as before on the right end. The top strand has a piece of blue, then a short orange region, then a purple region from the center to center right, and then is orange with gene B in its original location. The bottom strand of this product is blue across most of its length but orange at the right end beneath the orange region of the top strand. The bottom product has a top strand that is orange with gene A, then has a purple region from the center left to the center, then has a small orange region, then is blue until the right end. The bottom strand is orange with gene A, then becomes blue beneath where the top strand becomes purple and stays blue to the right end. Part b shows two joined blue strands next to two joined red strands. The blue strands curve up, then down, then up and the orange strands curve up and then down. This is labeled leptotene. Next, the strands are shown with their right ends closely aligned and so that the two blue strands are directly above the two orange strands. The sets of strands are angled from lower right to upper left, then separate to the left as the orange strands bend down before the blue strands bend down. This is labeled zygotene. The two sets of strands are aligned vertically in the next illustration. The right-hand blue strand bends to join the left-hand red strand, which bends to join the same blue strand at the same place. Both sets narrow near the bottom, then widen again. This stage is labeled pachytene. Next, the blue strands are shown in an “X” shape with the top arms longer than the bottom arms. The orange strands are shown similarly to the right. The right-hand blue arm overlaps the left-hand orange arm. The right-hand blue arm becomes orange as it overlaps the orange arm and the orange arm becomes blue at the same area of overlap. This is labeled diplotene. Part c shows a circular mass of chromosomes in the leptotene stage, then chromosomes that are more spread out in the zygotene stage, then chromosomes that are grouped together and thicker in the pachytene stage, then tightly linked chromosomes that join and overlap to form circular regions in the diplotene stage. The areas where chromosomes join are labeled chiasmata.</p>

<p class="subtitle" epub:type="subtitle" id="dav_9781319322342_wKxXNTEaT7" role="doc-subtitle">Why Proper Segregation of Chromosomes Matters</p></header>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_yGjSGRN8e0">When chromosomal alignment and recombination are not correct and complete in meiosis I, segregation of chromosomes can go awry. One result may be aneuploidy, a condition in which a cell has the wrong number of chromosomes. The haploid products of meiosis (gametes or spores) may have no copies or two copies of a chromosome. When a gamete having two copies of a chromosome joins with a gamete having one copy of a chromosome during fertilization, cells in the resulting embryo have three copies of that chromosome (they are trisomic).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_VXJyplVBDW">In <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_pdNIFwA2QN">S</i>. <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_BDlQGPJPs3">cerevisiae</i>, aneuploidy resulting from errors in meiosis occurs at a rate of about 1 in 10,000 meiotic events. In fruit flies, the rate is about 1 in a few thousand. Rates of aneuploidy in mammals are considerably higher. In mice, the rate is 1 in 100, and it is even higher in other mammals. The rate of aneuploidy in fertilized human eggs has been estimated as 10% to 30%; this is almost certainly an underestimate. Most of these aneuploid cells are monosomies (they have a single copy of a chromosome) or trisomies. Most trisomies are lethal, and many result in miscarriage long before the pregnancy is detected. Almost all monosomies are fatal in the early stages of fetal development. Aneuploidy is the leading cause of pregnancy loss. The few trisomic fetuses that survive to birth generally have three copies of chromosome 13, 18, or 21 (trisomy 21 is Down syndrome). Abnormal complements of the sex chromosomes are also found in the human population. The societal consequences of aneuploidy in humans are considerable. Aneuploidy is the leading genetic cause of developmental and mental disabilities. At the heart of these high rates is a feature of meiosis in female mammals that has special significance for the human species.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_X7Sdn9Bz72">In a human male, germ-line cells begin to undergo meiosis at puberty, and each meiotic event requires a relatively short time. In contrast, meiosis in the germ-line cells of human females is a highly protracted process. The production of an egg begins before a female is born, with the onset of meiosis in the fetus, at 12 to 13 weeks of gestation. Meiosis is initiated in all the developing fetal germ-line cells over a period of a few weeks. The cells proceed through much of meiosis I. Chromosomes line up and generate crossovers, continuing just beyond the pachytene stage (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_T6dTtuEXFL" id="dav_9781319322342_xD7xhUtaNJ">Fig. 25-34</a>) — and then the process stops. The chromosomes enter an arrested phase called the dictyate stage, with the crossovers in place, a kind of suspended animation where they remain as the female matures — so, typically remaining in this stage for anywhere from about 13 to 50 years. At sexual maturity, individual germ-line cells continue through the two meiotic cell divisions to produce egg cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_RkS0ZRctra">Between the onset of the dictyate stage and the final completion of meiosis, something may happen that disrupts or damages the crossovers linking homologous chromosomes in the germ-line cells. As a woman ages, the rate of trisomy in the egg cells she produces increases, dramatically so as she approaches menopause (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vAuoPy6n8l" id="dav_9781319322342_cGIaySVaV6">Fig. 1</a>). There are many hypotheses on why this occurs, and several different factors may play a role. However, most of the hypotheses are centered on recombination crossovers in meiosis I and their stability over the protracted dictyate stage.</p>

Meiotic homologous recombination can vary in many details from one species to another, but most of the steps outlined above are generally present in some form. There are two ways to resolve the Holliday intermediate with a RuvC-like nuclease so that the two products carry genes in the same linear order as in the substrates — the original, unrecombined chromosomes (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_ThiwqRrtFM" role="presentation" src="../images/5.png"/>).

Its molecular consequences for the generation of genetic diversity are subtle. To understand how this process contributes to diversity, we should keep in mind that the two homologous chromosomes that undergo recombination are not necessarily <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_4YRVAGBBQm">identical</i>. The linear array of genes may be the same, but the base sequences in some of the genes may differ slightly (in different alleles). In a human, for example, one chromosome may contain the allele for hemoglobin A (normal hemoglobin) while the other contains the allele for hemoglobin S (the sickle cell mutation). The difference may consist of no more than one base pair among millions.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_j1NdP0tw1m">Crossing over is not an entirely random process, and “hot spots” have been identified on many eukaryotic chromosomes. However, the assumption that crossing over can occur with equal probability at almost any point along the length of two homologous chromosomes remains a reasonable approximation in many cases, and it is this assumption that permits the mapping of genes on a particular chromosome. The frequency of homologous recombination in any region separating two points on a chromosome is roughly proportional to the distance between the points, and this allows determination of the relative positions of different genes and the distances between those genes. The independent assortment of unlinked genes on different chromosomes (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Be2V2mgewz"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZWFRg1sNvI" id="dav_9781319322342_GR8ziHvZjz">Fig. 25-35</a></strong>) <span aria-label="948" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page948" role="doc-pagebreak"/>makes another major contribution to the genetic diversity of gametes.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_9WulIHWga4">Each human chromosome contains many millions of DNA base pairs, all bound up in an elaborate chromatin structure (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_NiXMIb5pnu" id="dav_9781319322342_6Irf6KNwBu">Chapter 24</a>). If a strand break occurs somewhere in the DNA, how do the many proteins needed for its repair actually find it? The answer lies, at least in part, in a protein called poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1, or PARP1. PARP1 is a first responder, scanning the DNA for DNA damage and in particular for single-strand breaks. When it finds such sites, it binds and synthesizes an elaborate branched poly-ADP ribose polymer from an NAD precursor (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_E8sP3XBJLM" id="dav_9781319322342_maabvKoPmO">Fig. 1</a>). The polymers are attached to the PARP1 enzyme and also linked to some nearby proteins through Glu, Asp, or Lys residues. The resulting structure is a kind of signal, marking the chromosomal location of damage. A large number of DNA repair proteins bind to and are thus recruited to the poly-ADP ribose polymers, effecting DNA repair. If PARP1 activity is absent, repair is compromised and the number of single-strand breaks in all chromosomes increases. When the chromosome is replicated, the single-strand breaks become double-strand breaks (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_K60IH5ldMM" id="dav_9781319322342_cf0zeBzXzk">Fig. 25-29</a>).</p>

For example, breast or ovarian cancer is often associated with defects in double-strand break repair (e.g., in the genes encoding BRCA1 or BRCA2 or other proteins in the pathway). In these cells, the further loss of PARP1 activity is especially toxic, as single-strand breaks build up and chromosomes become broken during replication. This has led to the development of PARP1 inhibitors as a treatment for tumors in which double-strand break repair is defective. The first such pharmaceutical agent, olaparib, was approved for use in the United States in 2014. Many more PARP1 inhibitors have since been approved or are undergoing clinical trials. The effects have often been dramatic. For women with breast or ovarian tumors displaying deficiencies in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that have responded to more traditional therapies, subsequent maintenance treatment with PARP1 inhibitors has led to a fourfold increase in progression-free survival. PARP1 inhibitors are also showing promise for use with other breast and ovarian tumors, as well as other types of tumors, most of which have DNA repair deficiencies of some kind. As research continues, the use of PARP inhibitors is becoming an important part of the standard of care for a growing list of cancers.</p>

At these times, another path is needed to avoid the cell death that would result from a broken chromosome.

The importance of NHEJ increases with genomic complexity, and the process accounts for most double-strand break <span aria-label="949" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page949" role="doc-pagebreak"/>repair outside meiosis in mammals. In yeast, most double-strand breaks are repaired by recombination, and only a few by NHEJ. NHEJ is a mutagenic process, and a smaller genome, such as that of yeast, has relatively little tolerance for the loss of information. The small genomic alterations may be tolerable in mammalian somatic cells, because they are balanced by the undamaged information on the homolog in each diploid cell, and in these non-germ-line cells the mutations are not inherited. In vertebrates, a loss of the genes encoding NHEJ function can produce a predisposition to cancer.</p>

The Ku proteins are conserved in almost all eukaryotes and act as a kind of molecular scaffold to assemble the other protein components. Ku70-Ku80 interacts with another protein complex containing a protein kinase called DNA-PKcs and a nuclease known as Artemis. Once the complex is assembled, the two broken DNA ends are synapsed (held together). DNA-PKcs autophosphorylates in several locations and also phosphorylates Artemis.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_xzQq8FwfcJ">DNA ends are not joined randomly by NHEJ. Instead, when a double-strand break occurs, the ends are generally constrained by the structure of chromatin and thus remain close together. Very rare events linking end sequences that are normally far apart in the chromosome, or are on different chromosomes, may be responsible for occasional dramatic and usually deleterious genomic rearrangements.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_IYZq8zCuFM">Homologous genetic recombination can involve any two homologous sequences. The second general type of recombination, site-specific recombination, is a very different type of process: recombination is limited to specific sequences. Recombination reactions of this type occur in virtually every cell, filling specialized roles that vary greatly from one species to another. Examples include regulation of the expression of certain genes and promotion of programmed DNA rearrangements in embryonic development or in the replication cycles of some viral and plasmid DNAs. Each site-specific recombination system consists of an enzyme called a recombinase and a short (20 to 200 bp), unique DNA sequence where the recombinase acts (the recombination site). One or more auxiliary proteins may regulate the timing or outcome of the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_SfPnBBFzr8">There are two general classes of site-specific recombination systems, which rely on either Tyr or Ser residues in the active site. In vitro studies of many site-specific recombination systems in the tyrosine class have elucidated some general principles, including the fundamental reaction pathway (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_E4qolXo5hL"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_9wx8o0s3YS" id="dav_9781319322342_xFuM1I6Djz">Fig. 25-37a</a></strong>). Several of these enzymes have been crystallized, revealing structural details of the reaction. A separate recombinase recognizes and binds to each of two recombination sites on two different DNA molecules or within the same DNA. One DNA strand in each site is cleaved at a specific point within the site, and the recombinase becomes covalently linked to the DNA at the cleavage site through a phosphotyrosine bond (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_wGXd5i2Sii" role="presentation" src="../images/1a.png"/>). The transient protein-DNA linkage preserves the phosphodiester bond that is lost in cleaving the DNA, so high-energy cofactors such as ATP are unnecessary in subsequent steps. The cleaved DNA strands are rejoined to new partners to form a Holliday intermediate, with new phosphodiester bonds created at the expense of the protein-DNA linkage (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_1n6l1e8aFK" role="presentation" src="../images/2.png"/>). An isomerization then occurs (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_K6NuPNkDVt" role="presentation" src="../images/3.png"/>), and the process is repeated at a second point within each of the two recombination sites (steps <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_4CPrcxGMSC" role="presentation" src="../images/4.png"/> and <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_v6nyjJ8Iln" role="presentation" src="../images/5.png"/>). In systems that employ an active-site Ser residue, both strands of each recombination site are cut concurrently and rejoined to new partners without the Holliday intermediate. In both types of systems, the exchange is always reciprocal and precise, regenerating the recombination sites when the reaction is complete. We can view a recombinase as a site-specific endonuclease and ligase in one package.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_clbB1ICIwQ">Part a shows four spheres in a roughly cuboidal shape with lighter spheres at the upper left and lower right and darker spheres at the lower left and upper right. These spheres are labeled recombinase. A light blue strand begins at its 5 prime end at the upper left of the upper left sphere and runs diagonally down to the place where the two top spheres meet, then bends upward to end at its 3 prime end. A dark blue strand begins at its 3 prime end below and runs beneath the light blue strand into the very top of the lower left sphere, then loops over the bottom bend of the light blue sphere down again, and then up to end at its 5 prime end beneath the 3 prime end of the light blue sphere. A red arrow points from T y r to the place where the blue strand crosses behind the light blue strand. T y r is also shown at the lower right of the upper right sphere. The bottom two spheres show the same pattern flipped so that the strands run up instead of down and with dark and light red strands instead of blue strands. Step 1: Cleavage. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. This yields a product in which the blue strand follows a similar trajectory, but the light blue sphere begins at its 5 prime end at the upper right and runs diagonally down to curve up to a white circle labeled P bonded to T y r at the right side of the upper left sphere. In the upper right sphere, the light blue strand runs from its 3 prime end at the upper right down to the lower left, then vertically down to O H in the lower right sphere. The same pattern is present with the red lines except that they are flipped so that they run in opposite directions to the blue strands. Step 2: Rejoining. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows labeled rejoining indicate a reversible reaction. The dark blue and dark red strands remain the same. The light blue strand beginning at 5 prime at the upper left runs down to the lower right of the upper left sphere, then joins the light red strand and bends back to end at its 3 prime end to the lower left of the lower left sphere. The 3 prime end of the light blue sphere at the upper right of the upper right sphere runs to the lower left and then bends down and then to the lower right. Its lower right portion is light red. This structure forms a central square around a small opening between the spheres with light red on the left, dark blue on the top, light blue on the right, and dark red below. In this illustration, the upper left sphere is labeled (a). Step 3: Isomerization. Right- and left-pointing arrows labeled isomerization indicate a reversible reaction. This illustration resembles the previous illustration except that the dark gray spheres are now at the upper left and lower right and the light gray spheres are at the lower left and upper right. The stands are in the same orientations despite the movement of the spheres. Text beneath these spheres and those in the previous step reads, Holliday intermediates. T y r is shown with a red arrow pointing to the dark red strand near where it meets the light red strand in the lower left sphere and pointing to the dark blue strand near where it meets the light blue strand in the upper right sphere. Step 4: Cleavage. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. This yields a similar structure in which the central opening has become smaller, the red strand ends in O H right after crossing the light red strand, and the dark blue strand ends at O H just after crossing the light blue strand. The remaining dark red piece still begins at 5 prime at the lower left, but runs up and then curves left to end at a white circle labeled P bonded to T y r. The remaining dark blue piece still starts at 5 prime at the upper right and runs to the lower left, then bends to bind to a white circle labeled P bonded to T y r. Step 5: Rejoining. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. On the left, the 5 prime end of the light blue strand runs to the lower right to meet the light red strand, which bends left and then back right before looping back to end at the 3 prime end at the lower left. The dark blue 3 prime end is below the 5 prime end of the light blue piece and run right across the light red piece where it loops to the left before looping back under the light red piece and joining a bright red piece to end at the 5 prime end to the lower right. The 3 prime end of the light blue piece at the upper right runs to the lower left, then loops right, then back left, then back right to join a light red piece to end at the 5 prime end at the lower right. The 5 prime end of the dark blue piece begins beneath is and runs left before becoming red, then runs over the light blue piece before looping back under it to run diagonally to end at the 3 prime end at the lower right. Part b shows a surface contour illustration with roughly spherical white pieces at the upper left and lower right and roughly spherical gray pieces to the lower left and upper right. A blue piece begins at the upper left of the upper white piece, runs down to just above the opening between the pieces where it is open, and then runs up to end at the upper right in the dark gray piece. A red piece of D N A begins at the lower left, runs up to the central open area where it connects with the blue strands above, then bends down to the lower right.</p>

If the two sites are on the same DNA molecule, the reaction either inverts or deletes the intervening DNA, determined by whether the recombination sites have the opposite or the same orientation, respectively. If the sites are on different DNAs, the recombination is intermolecular; if one or both DNAs are circular, the result is an insertion. Some recombinase systems are highly specific for one of these reaction types and act only on sites with particular orientations.</p>

Recombinational DNA repair of a circular bacterial chromosome, while essential, sometimes generates deleterious byproducts.

The left-hand piece has arrows pointing down on either side of the top yellow piece and up at either side of the bottom yellow piece. This is labeled direct transposition. The right-hand piece is similar but has fewer arrows. It has an arrow pointing up to the left side of the bottom yellow piece and an arrow pointing down to the right side of the upper yellow piece. This is labeled replicative transposition. Arrows point down from each structure. Step 2: Free ends of transposons attack target D N A. In direct transposition, two double stranded red pieces are shown, a double stranded yellow piece is shown with the top right ending with 3 prime O H and the lower left ending with 3 prime O H. Each O has a red pair of electrons. Blue double stranded target D N A is below. Red arrows point from each red pair of electron on O to a location on the target D N A, one on the top piece and one on the bottom piece. In replicative transposition, a strand is shown with red attached to a yellow piece ending with 3 prime O H, then there is a loose red piece. Below, there is a loose red piece, then the end of a yellow piece with 3 prime O H that has a red piece bonded to the other end of the yellow piece. Each O has a red pair of electrons. An oval of double stranded D N A is below. Red arrows point from the red pairs of electrons on O to the target D N A, one pointing to the inner strand and one pointing to the outer strand. Arrows point down from each side. Step 3: Gaps filled (left) or entire transposon replicated (right). On the left, a blue piece has a small space before a yellow piece joined with a blue piece. Beneath, a blue piece is joined to a yellow piece and then there is a space before there is another blue piece. On the right, two yellow pieces are in the double-stranded oval with one in the outer strand and one in the outer strand. The yellow piece in the outer strand ends with a red piece that bends up with a parallel short red piece running up to its left with 3 prime below next to O H on the end of the adjacent blue piece to its left. The yellow piece in the inner strand ends with a red piece that bends inward. A small red piece runs along it with 3 prime above next to O H at the end of the blue piece. An arrow points down on the left accompanied by text reading, blue highlighted D N A polymerase, D N A ligase. This yields two strands. The top strand has a blue piece, then a short red piece, then a yellow piece, then a blue piece. The bottom strand has a blue piece, then a yellow piece, then a short red piece, then a blue piece. Step 4: Site-specific recombination (within transposon). The oval double-stranded D N A has separated so that there is a bottom piece that is almost an oval with a top piece that has a top strand that is red then light red with a lower strand that is yellow and then light red. The blue piece coils around below and back across the top so that its lower strand has red above the red below that joins to light red to the left. The strand above has yellow above the red in the strand below and this piece is also joined to light red. Lines joining the red pieces read, cointegrate. An arrow points down to show a blue oval with the top center having red followed by yellow in the top strand and yellow followed by red in the bottom strand. Above this, there are two linear strands. The top strand is light red, then yellow, then red, then light red. The bottom strand is light red, then red, then yellow, then light red.</p>

Both are described in the next chapter. As illustrated in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YonI6Mg8sG" id="dav_9781319322342_7HppMX1y5p">Figure 9-25</a>, nearly half of the human genome is made up of various types of transposable elements.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_FEji1G1w47">Some DNA rearrangements are a programmed part of development in eukaryotic organisms. An important example is the generation of complete immunoglobulin genes from separate gene segments in vertebrate genomes. <span aria-label="954" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page954" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A human (like other mammals) is capable of producing <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_g4imXAQxeQ">millions</i> of different immunoglobulins (antibodies) with distinct binding specificities, even though the human genome contains only ~20,000 genes. Recombination allows an organism to produce an extraordinary diversity of antibodies from a limited DNA-coding capacity. Studies of the recombination mechanism reveal a close relationship to DNA transposition and suggest that this system for generating antibody diversity may have evolved from an ancient cellular invasion by transposons.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_GgWLw1iAPD">We can use the human genes that encode proteins of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class to illustrate how antibody diversity is generated. Immunoglobulins consist of two heavy and two light polypeptide chains (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch05_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_TRdSyyMXTE" id="dav_9781319322342_ndjBDcoHZF">Fig. 5-20</a>). Each chain has two regions: a variable region, with a sequence that differs greatly from one immunoglobulin to another, and a region that is virtually constant within a class of immunoglobulins. There are also two distinct families of light chains, kappa and lambda, which differ somewhat in the sequences of their constant regions. For all three types of polypeptide chains (heavy chain, and kappa and lambda light chains), diversity in the variable regions is generated by a similar mechanism. The genes for these polypeptides are divided into segments, and the genome contains clusters with multiple versions of each segment. The joining of one version of each gene segment creates a complete gene.</p>

In undifferentiated cells, the coding information for this polypeptide chain is separated into three segments. The V (variable) segment encodes the first 95 amino acid residues of the variable region, the J (joining) segment encodes the remaining 12 residues of the variable region, and the C segment encodes the constant region. The genome contains 40 different V segments, 5 different J segments, and 1 C segment.</p>

Because any heavy chain can combine with any light chain to generate an immunoglobulin, each human has at least <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_48mu1go97m" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5,000</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>2.5</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mn>6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="500 times 5,000 equals 2.5 times 10 Superscript 6" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch25_04EQ_0032.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> possible IgGs. And additional diversity is generated by high mutation rates (of unknown mechanism) in the V sequences during B-lymphocyte differentiation. Each mature B lymphocyte produces only one type of antibody, but the range of antibodies produced by the B lymphocytes of an individual organism is clearly enormous.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_XxwPme0D0b">Did the immune system evolve in part from ancient transposons? The mechanism for generation of the double-strand breaks by RAG1 and RAG2 mirrors several reaction steps in transposition (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_e0anv5fdkv" id="dav_9781319322342_o8YXh6gzaF">Fig. 25-43</a>). In addition, the deleted DNA, with its terminal RSSs, has a sequence structure found in most transposons. In the test tube, RAG1 and RAG2 can associate with this deleted DNA and insert it, transposonlike, into other DNA molecules (probably a rare reaction in B lymphocytes). Although we cannot know for certain, the properties of the immunoglobulin gene rearrangement system suggest an intriguing origin in which the distinction between host and parasite has become blurred by evolution.</p>

Recombinases cleave the DNA at specific points and ligate the strands to new partners. This type of recombination is found in virtually all cells, and its many functions include DNA integration and regulation of gene expression.</li>
