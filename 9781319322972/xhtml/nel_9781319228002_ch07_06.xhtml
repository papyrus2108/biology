<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_lhbGnwJkNx">Oligosaccharide analysis is complicated by the fact that, unlike nucleic acids and proteins, oligosaccharides can be branched and are joined by a variety of linkages. The high charge density of many oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, and the relative lability of the sulfate esters in glycosaminoglycans, present further difficulties.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9OFp1HXIYo">For simple, linear polymers such as amylose, the positions of the glycosidic bonds are determined by the classical method of exhaustive methylation: treating the intact polysaccharide with methyl iodide in a strongly basic medium to convert all free hydroxyls to acid-stable methyl ethers, then hydrolyzing the methylated polysaccharide in acid. The only free hydroxyls in the monosaccharide derivatives so produced are those that were involved in glycosidic bonds. To determine the sequence of monosaccharide residues, including any branches that are present, exoglycosidases of known specificity are used to remove residues one at a time from the nonreducing end(s). The known specificity of these exoglycosidases often allows deduction of the position and stereochemistry of the linkages.</p>

Highly purified lectins, attached covalently to an insoluble support, can be used in affinity chromatography of carbohydrates.</p>

An arrow pointing downward to the next box is labeled, release oligosaccharides with endoglycosidase. The next box reads, oligosaccharide mixture. An arrow pointing downward to the next box reads 1) ion-exchange chromatography; 2) gel filtration; 3) lectin affinity chromatography. The next box reads, separated oligosaccharides. Five lines branch from this box. The first line leads to a box to the left labeled purified polysaccharide. The second line is an arrow that angles downward accompanied by text reading, hydrolysis with strong acid. This leads to a box labeled monosaccharides. An arrow labeled high-performance liquid chromatography or derivation and gas-liquid chromatography points to the bottom box, labeled composition of mixture; types and amounts of monosaccharide units. The third line from the separated oligosaccharides box is an arrow labeled exhaustive methylation with C H 3 I, strong base, that points to a box labeled fully methylated carbohydrate. An arrow pointing down from this is labeled acid hydrolysis yields monosaccharides methylated at every bonded O H except those involved in glycosidic bonds. The arrow points to a box labeled position(s) of glycosidic bonds. The fourth line from the separated oligosaccharides box is an arrow labeled enzymatic hydrolysis with specific glycosidases. This arrow points to a box labeled smaller oligosaccharides, from which one arrow points down and one points to the right. The right-hand arrow points to the fifth line on the right, which is a line that points from the box labeled separated oligosaccharides, is labeled N M R and mass spectrometry, and points to a box labeled sequence of monosaccharides; position and configuration of glycosidic bonds. The second arrow from the box labeled smaller oligosaccharides points downward and is labeled resolution of fragments in mixture. A second arrow points down and is labeled each oligosaccharide subjected to methylation or enzymatic analysis. This arrow points to a box labeled sequence of monosaccharides; position and configuration of glycosidic bonds.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_U3bu338ug7">Hydrolysis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in strong acid yields a mixture of monosaccharides, which can be identified and quantified by chromatographic techniques to yield the overall composition of the polymer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_3B7OlfIDjO">Oligosaccharide analysis relies heavily on mass spectrometry (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qvA8lojGqH" id="dav_9781319322342_1Sfh2DtWIR">Figs 3-28</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Wb5D56NqwA" id="dav_9781319322342_5yIri3tE9N">3-29</a>) and high-resolution NMR spectroscopy (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Stx3BpDtLo" id="dav_9781319322342_SdIbvHT6BB">Fig. 4-31</a>). NMR analysis alone, especially for oligosaccharides of moderate size, can yield much information about sequence, linkage position, and anomeric carbon configuration. Automated procedures and commercial instruments are used for the routine determination of oligosaccharide structure, but the sequencing of branched oligosaccharides joined by more than one type of bond remains a far more formidable task than determining the linear sequences of proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4P78hCou2Z">Another important tool in working with carbohydrates is chemical synthesis, which has proved to be a powerful approach to understanding the biological functions of glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides. The chemistry involved in such syntheses is difficult, but carbohydrate chemists can now synthesize short segments of almost any glycosaminoglycan, with correct stereochemistry, chain length, and sulfation pattern, and oligosaccharides significantly more complex than those <span aria-label="260" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" role="doc-pagebreak"/>shown in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RkEaKH4siG" id="dav_9781319322342_aMlYC4tg6S">Figure 7-27</a>. Solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis is based on the same principles (and has the same advantages) as peptide synthesis (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zHu7CHLMYg" id="dav_9781319322342_lE46woJDmU">Fig. 3-30</a>), but requires a set of tools unique to carbohydrate chemistry: blocking groups and activating groups that allow the synthesis of glycosidic linkages with the correct hydroxyl group. Synthetic approaches of this type currently represent an area of great interest, because it is difficult to purify defined oligosaccharides in adequate quantities from natural sources.</p>

Traditional chemical and enzymatic approaches, as well as mass spectrometry and high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, applicable to small samples of carbohydrate, yield essential information about sequence, configuration at anomeric and other carbons, and positions of glycosidic bonds. Solid-phase synthetic methods yield defined oligosaccharides that are of great value in exploring lectin-oligosaccharide interactions and may prove clinically useful.</li>
