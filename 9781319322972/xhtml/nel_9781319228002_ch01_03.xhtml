<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_P3VZLHKIEZ">Biochemistry aims to explain biological form and function in chemical terms. During the first half of the twentieth century, parallel biochemical investigations of glucose breakdown in yeast and in animal muscle cells revealed remarkable chemical similarities between these two apparently very different cell types; for example, the breakdown of glucose in yeast and in muscle cells involved the same 10 chemical intermediates and the same 10 enzymes. Subsequent studies of many other biochemical processes in many different organisms have confirmed the generality of this observation, neatly summarized in 1954 by the biochemist Jacques Monod: “What is true of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_2eIcR1vshc">E. coli</i> is true of the elephant.” The current understanding that all organisms share a common evolutionary origin is based in part on this observed universality of chemical intermediates and transformations, often termed “biochemical unity.”</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_CFPJSRiQps">Fewer than 30 of the more than 90 naturally occurring chemical elements are known to be essential to organisms. Most of the elements in living matter have a relatively low atomic number; only three have an atomic number above that of selenium, 34 (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_NA6SL7FA7r"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch01_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vv9ciKNMHu" id="dav_9781319322342_AMukrljx3m">Fig. 1-11</a></strong>). The four most abundant elements in living organisms, in terms of percentage of total number of atoms, are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, which together make up more than 99% of the mass of most cells. They are the lightest elements capable of efficiently forming one, two, three, and four bonds, respectively; in general, the lightest elements form the strongest bonds. The trace elements represent a miniscule fraction of the weight of the human body, but all are essential to life, usually because they are essential to the function of specific proteins, including many enzymes. The oxygen-transporting capacity of the hemoglobin molecule, for example, is absolutely dependent on four iron ions that make up only 0.3% of the molecule’s mass.</p>

It seems likely that the bonding versatility of carbon, with itself and with other elements, was a major factor in the selection of carbon compounds for the molecular machinery of cells during the origin and evolution of living organisms. No other chemical element can form molecules of such widely different sizes, shapes, and composition.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_CciSCyQXvY">Most biomolecules can be regarded as derivatives of hydrocarbons, with hydrogen atoms replaced by a variety of functional groups that confer specific chemical properties on the molecule, forming various families of organic compounds. Typical of these are alcohols, which have one or more hydroxyl groups; amines, with amino groups; aldehydes and ketones, with carbonyl groups; and carboxylic acids, with carboxyl groups (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_OYi5ZwFd7Q"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch01_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_rYsXmRlvVd" id="dav_9781319322342_RkqmwYzyUY">Fig. 1-14</a></strong>).

This model is linear but kinks back toward the left at its right end. From left to right, the structure begins with C H 3 that is bonded to C of a thioester group that also includes double bonded O below and S to the right. S is further bonded to C H 2, which is bonded to C H 2, which is bonded to N H of an amido group. This N is bonded to C that is double bonded to O below, forming the amido group, and then is further bonded to C H 2 that is bonded to C H 2 that is further bonded to the N H of another amido group. This N is bonded to C that is double bonded to O below, forming the amido group, and then is further bonded to C that is bonded to H above, O H below (a hydroxyl group), and C on the right that is bonded to C H 3 above, C H 3 below, and C H 2 to the right that is further bonded to O that is further bonded to P of a phosphoanhydride. The phosphoanhydride consists of the P bonded to O minus above, double bonded to O below, and bonded to O that is further bonded to P bonded to O minus above, double bonded to O below, and bonded to O outside of the amido group. The O is bonded to C H 2 that bonds to C H at the left side vertex of a five-membered ring. The ring has O at the top vertex. C H at the bottom left vertex is further bonded to O that is bonded to a phosphoryl group of P bonded to O minus, bonded to O H, and double bonded to O. The C H at the bottom right vertex is bonded to O H. The C H at the right side vertex is bonded to N at the bottom vertex of an imidazole-like five-membered ring that is fused with a six-membered ring to its right. The imidazole-like ring has N substituted for C at its bottom and top vertices, C H at its left side vertex, and double bonds at the top left vertex and the right side vertex shared with the six-membered ring. The rest of the six-membered ring is not part of the imidazole-like group. It has N substituted for C at the top right and bottom vertices, C H at the right side vertex, double bonds at the top and bottom right vertices, and an amino group, N H 2, bonded to C at the top vertex.</p>

These are the central metabolites in the major pathways occurring in nearly every cell — the metabolites and pathways that have been conserved throughout the course of evolution. This collection of molecules includes the common amino acids, nucleotides, sugars and their phosphorylated derivatives, and mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic acids. The molecules may be polar or charged and most are water-soluble. They are trapped in the cell because the plasma membrane is impermeable to them, although specific membrane transporters can catalyze the movement of some molecules into and out of the cell or between compartments in eukaryotic cells. The universal occurrence of the same set of compounds in living cells reflects the evolutionary conservation of metabolic pathways that developed in the earliest cells.</p>

Phosphate has P bonded to 2 O minus, bonded to O H, and double bonded to O. The five-carbon sugars are alpha-D-ribose and 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose. Alpha-D-ribose is a five-membered ring with O at the top vertex and the following structure: C 1, C 2, and C 3 have H above the ring and O H below the right; C 4 has H O C H 2 above the ring and H below the ring. 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose has a similar structure, except that C 2 has H above and below the ring. Part c, at the right of the figure, shows some components of lipids including palmitate, glycerol, and choline. Palmitate is a 16-carbon chain with C H 3 at one end, C H 2 for 14 carbons, and ending with C O O minus. Glycerol is a three-carbon chain with C 1 bonded to 2 H and O H, C 2 bonded to H and O H, and C 3 bonded to 2 H and O H. Choline has N plus bonded to 3 C H 3 and a chain consisting of C H 2 bonded to C H 2 O H. Part d at the bottom right is the parent sugar, which is alpha-D-glucose.

It has two gray atoms connected by a single bond. Each gray atom has three evenly spaced white atoms extending out from it. At the peaks, the three atoms around the central atom are lined up so that someone looking at the atom directly from the front would not see the atoms in the back. This is labeled, fully eclipsed conformation. At the minima on the curve, the front atom has been rotated clockwise so that the atoms around the central atom are not lined up. If viewed from the front, all six atoms would appear evenly spaced. This is labeled, fully staggered conformation.</p>
