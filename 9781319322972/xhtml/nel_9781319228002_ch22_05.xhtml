They are the precursors of DNA and RNA. They are essential carriers of chemical energy — a role primarily of ATP and to some extent GTP. They are components of the cofactors NAD, FAD, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_pXe7hR5KK8">S</i>-adenosylmethionine, and coenzyme A, as well as of activated biosynthetic intermediates such as UDP-glucose and CDP-diacylglycerol. Some, such as cAMP and cGMP, are also cellular second messengers.</p>

Salvage pathways recycle the free bases and nucleosides released from nucleic acid breakdown. Both types of pathways are important in cellular metabolism, and both are discussed in this section.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_rcmz9b4K8L">The de novo pathways for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis seem to be nearly identical in all living organisms. Notably, the free bases guanine, adenine, thymine, cytidine, and uracil are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_B13SKNhzRH">not</i> intermediates in these pathways; that is, the bases are not synthesized and then attached to ribose, as might be expected. The purine ring structure is built up one or a few atoms at a time, attached to ribose throughout the process. The <span aria-label="824" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page824" role="doc-pagebreak"/>pyrimidine ring is synthesized as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_xAG6VisYMx">orotate</dfn>, attached to ribose phosphate, and then converted to the common pyrimidine nucleotides required in nucleic acid synthesis. Although the free bases are not intermediates in the de novo pathways, they are intermediates in some of the salvage pathways.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_XxBYUfAuye">Several important precursors are shared by the de novo pathways for synthesis of pyrimidines and purines. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is important in both, and in these pathways the structure of ribose is retained in the product nucleotide, in contrast to its fate in the tryptophan and histidine biosynthetic pathways discussed earlier. An amino acid is an important precursor in each type of pathway: glycine for purines and aspartate for pyrimidines. Glutamine again is the most important source of amino groups — in five different steps in the de novo pathways. Aspartate is also used as the source of an amino group in the purine pathways, in two steps.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_exGFY5s7pR">Two other features deserve mention. First, there is evidence, especially in the de novo purine pathway, that the enzymes are present as large, multienzyme complexes or metabolons in the cell, a recurring theme in our discussion of metabolism. Second, the cellular pools of nucleotides (other than ATP) are quite small, perhaps 1% or less of the amounts required to synthesize the cell’s DNA. Therefore, cells must continue to synthesize nucleotides during nucleic acid synthesis, and in some cases, nucleotide synthesis may limit the rates of DNA replication and transcription. Because of the importance of these processes in dividing cells, agents that inhibit nucleotide synthesis have become particularly important in medicine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_m3K9aq6Pdq"><span aria-label="825" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page825" role="doc-pagebreak"/>We examine here the biosynthetic pathways of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and their regulation, the formation of the deoxynucleotides, and the degradation of purines and pyrimidines to uric acid and urea. We end with a discussion of chemotherapeutic agents that affect nucleotide synthesis.</p>

The bacterial ATCase molecule consists of six catalytic subunits and six regulatory subunits (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_mOfxO4E2tH" id="dav_9781319322342_hjdOJSDY3E">Fig. 6-36</a>). The catalytic subunits bind the substrate molecules, and the allosteric subunits bind the allosteric inhibitor, CTP. The entire ATCase molecule, as well as its subunits, exists in two conformations, active and inactive. When CTP is not bound to the regulatory subunits, the enzyme is maximally active. As CTP accumulates and binds to the regulatory subunits, they undergo a change in conformation. This change is transmitted to the catalytic subunits, which then also shift to an inactive conformation. ATP prevents the changes induced by CTP. <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_FBAAGGqQ9B"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_JFELV1opTF" id="dav_9781319322342_TjZNzlsCjO">Figure 22-40</a></strong> shows the effects of the allosteric regulators on the activity of ATCase.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_sFDJOIrkU1">Part a shows a structure that resembles a tall half-circle with a relatively flat bottom. The top half has two alpha subunits divided by a vertical line through the venter. The left half is labeled regulatory sites and the right half is labeled allosteric effectors. The left alpha subunit has a half-oval cutout at the eleven o’clock position labeled substrate specificity site and a shallower rounded cutout just above the nine o’clock position labeled primary regulation site. The right half has similar cutouts with the upper cutout indicated by an arrow from A T P, d A T P, d G T P, and d T T P and the lower cutout indicated by an arrow from A T P, d A T P. The bottom of each of these alpha subunits has a shallow horizontal rectangular cutout where there are two bonds from the subunit to S H. Beneath the left alpha subunit, there is a horizontal piece labeled beta subunit that curves up on its left side to approach the lower left end of the alpha subunit above and that curves down on its right side. A similar piece on the right curves up on its right end and curves down across the left-hand bottom piece at its left end. Each of these bottom pieces has a bond to X H that extends from the inner surface of the piece that bends upward into the open region between it and the subunit above. There are roughly oval openings between each alpha subunit and the beta subunit below with a flattened top formed by the bottom of the alpha subunit. A narrower opening connects the left and right halves. The narrow opening between the upper end of the left-hand beta subunit curves up to and the bottom of the alpha subunit above is labeled active site, indicating the openings between the subunits where substrates can bind. Within the left-hand beta subunit, the left side is bonded to the left side vertex of a benzene ring inside that has a right side vertex bonded to O with a dot above and that is located in a beige box. A dashed line connects the right-hand O to F e 3 plus to the lower right in a brown region. This F e plus is bonded to O to the right further bonded to F e 3 plus to the upper right, all within the brown region. A similar structure is visible with a reverse orientation in the right-hand beta subunit except that the Fe 3 plus is closer to O with the dot. This F e 3 plus is bonded to O to the left further bonded to F e 3 plus that has moved so that the brown structure containing iron has a diagonal side above the right-hand F e 3 plus that lines up with a similar diagonal side above just below O, leaving a narrow space between them. Beneath the word substrates, A D P, C D P, U D P, and G D P are shown with an arrow pointing through the narrow left-hand opening into the wider region between the right-hand alpha and beta subunits. Part b is labeled alpha subscript 2 end subscript beta subscript 2 end subscript and shows a rounded structure consisting of blue helices at the upper left labeled alpha and a rounded structure at the upper right consisting of purple helices and labeled alpha. A single blue helix extends diagonally up to meet a single purple helix to its right and two smaller helices are present beneath them in the area between the two rounded structures. Below, a roughly diagonal rectangular structure made of yellow helices angles from the center to the lower left and a brown structure emerges from behind it to the lower right. These yellows and brown structures are labeled beta. Space filling models are visible at the top center of the bottom piece, just below the top of the yellow and brown part, and at the lower left of the subunit a consisting of purple helices. Part c is labeled radical pathway. It shows surface contours of a structure with a blue rounded upper lobe, a purple rounded upper right lobe, and a yellow central lobe with a brown piece running along its right side up into the purple piece above. A space-filling model in the lower center of the purple piece, just above the brown piece that extends into the purple piece, is labeled C y s superscript 439 end superscript at the top, T y r superscript 730 end superscript in the center, and T y r superscript 731 end superscript at the lower right. This piece is purple, red, and blue. A yellow, blue, and orange sphere near the center top of the yellow portion is labeled T r p superscript 48 end superscript. A linear yellow structure with a blue sphere at its upper left and an orange sphere on its right side is located just below is labeled T y r superscript 122 end superscript. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_qJ0wP5tLsa">An oval opening with narrow passages to the left and right is between a blue region above labeled alpha subunit and a blue region below labeled beta subunit. These represent subunits of the ribonuclease reductase enzyme around the open active site. At the upper right boundary of the alpha subunit, two bonds each extend to S bonded to H in a green box. At the bottom center, a bond extends up from the beta subunit to X with a red dot. A five-membered ring in the open region has O at its top center vertex; a right side vertex bonded to a box labeled base above and H below; the lower right vertex labeled 2 prime bonded to H above and O H below; the lower left vertex labeled 3 prime bonded to H in a red box above and O H below; and the left side vertex bonded to H below and to C H 2 above further bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to another circle labeled P. A red arrow points from the dot on X to the lower left vertex labeled 3 prime. Step 1: A 3 prime-ribonucleotide radical is formed. An arrow points right to show that X at the bottom is now bonded to H in a red box and the lower left vertex labeled 3 prime has a red dot on it. A pair of red electrons is on O bonded to the lower right vertex labeled 2 prime and a red arrow points from this to the bottom H in a green box bonded to S bonded to the alpha subunit. Step 2: The 2 prime hydroxyl is protonated. An arrow points down to a similar structure in which the lower S extending from the alpha subunit is now connected by two bonds to the alpha subunit and O bonded to C 2 prime now has a positive charge and is bonded to H to the right and to H in a green box below. Step 3: H 2 O is eliminated to form a radical-stabilized carbocation. An arrow points down accompanied by an arrow that branches to show the loss of O bonded to H to the lower right and to H in a green box to the lower left. This yields a similar structure in with C 2 prime is bonded to H and has a positive charge. Red arrows point from one bond between the bottom S and the alpha subunit to the S above it and from the bond between the top S and H in a green box to the positive charge on C 2 prime. Step 4: Dithiol is oxidized on the enzyme; two electrons are transferred to the 2 prime-carbon. An arrow points left to a similar structure in which the two S atoms bonded to the alpha subunit are connected by a bond in a yellow box and C 2 prime is bonded to H above and to H in a green box below. A red arrow points from the red dot on C 3 prime to the bond between the X attached to the beta subunit and H in a red box above. Step 5: Step 1 is reversed, regenerating a tyrosyl (X) radical on the enzyme. An arrow points up to a similar structure in which the X bonded to the beta subunit has a red dot and C 3 prime is bonded to H in a red box above and O H below. Text below the molecule in the active site reads, d N D P. Step 6: The enzyme dithiol is reduced, to complete the cycle. An arrow points up to the starting structure accompanied by an arrow branching off to show the loss of d N D P in a yellow box beneath a curved arrow showing the addition of thioredoxin (S H 2) (glutaredoxin) and loss of thioredoxin S bonded to S (glutaredoxin) beneath a curved line showing the addition of N D P in a yellow box. The cycle is completed.</p>

When ATP or dATP is bound, reduction of UDP and CDP is <span aria-label="832" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page832" role="doc-pagebreak"/>favored.

ATP is also a general activator for biosynthesis and ribonucleotide reduction. The presence of dATP in small amounts increases the reduction of pyrimidine nucleotides. An oversupply of the pyrimidine dNTPs is signaled by high levels of dTTP. Abundant dTTP shifts the specificity to favor reduction of GDP. High levels of dGTP, in turn, shift the specificity to ADP reduction, and high levels of dATP shut the enzyme down. These effectors are thought to induce several distinct enzyme conformations with altered specificities.</p>

The immediate precursor of thymidylate (dTMP) is dUMP. In bacteria, the pathway to dUMP begins with formation of dUTP, either by deamination of dCTP or by phosphorylation of dUDP (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_ipbvQRt5mE"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zdklB6bEr8" id="dav_9781319322342_VB3dJ2XmcQ">Fig. 22-46</a></strong>). The dUTP is converted to dUMP by a dUTPase. The latter reaction must be efficient to keep dUTP pools low and prevent incorporation of uridylate into DNA.</p>

When the deficiency is severe, the symptoms can include heart disease, cancer, and some types of brain dysfunction. Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy can also produce neural tube defects in infants. At least some of these symptoms arise from a reduction in thymidylate synthesis, leading to an abnormal incorporation of uracil into DNA. Uracil is recognized by DNA repair pathways (described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_mjjTUkBLW6">Chapter 25</a>) and is cleaved from the DNA. The presence of high levels of uracil in DNA leads to strand breaks that can greatly affect the function and regulation of nuclear DNA, ultimately causing the observed effects on the heart and brain, as well as increased mutagenesis that leads to cancer. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_UVO51dddjr" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

An arrow labeled nucleosidase points down from guanosine to guanine accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of ribose. Guanine is a six-membered ring that shares a double bond at its right side with a five-membered ring. The six-membered ring has double bonds at its lower left and right sides, N substituted for C at its bottom vertex, a lower left vertex bonded to N H 2, and N substituted for C at its upper left vertex and bonded to H. The five-membered ring has a double bond at its upper right side, N substituted for C at its upper right vertex, and N substituted for C at its lower right vertex and bonded to H. An arrow labeled guanine deaminase points from guanine to xanthine (keto form) at the lower right and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of N H 3. Xanthine (keto form) has a similar structure except that the lower left vertex of the six-membered ring is bonded to O H. Xanthine (keto form) is also produced by a series of reactions that begin with A M P. An arrow labeled 5 prime-nucleotidase points down from A M P to adenosine accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of P subscript i end subscript. An arrow labeled adenosine deaminase points down from adenosine to inosine accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of N H 3. An arrow labeled nucleosidase points down from inosine to hypoxanthine (keto form), which has a similar structure to xanthine (keto form) except that the lower left vertex of the six-membered ring is not bonded to O H. An arrow labeled xanthine oxidase points down from hypoxanthine (keto form) to xanthine (keto form) accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O plus O 2 and loss of H 2 O 2. An arrow labeled xanthine oxidase points down from xanthine (keto form) to uric acid accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O plus O 2 and loss of H 2 O 2. Uric acid has a similar structure to xanthine except that the right-hand five-membered ring has a right side vertex bonded to O H. On the right, a series of reactions is shown that converts uric acid to 4 N H 4 plus accompanied by information on what type of organism excretes each sort of waste in a right-hand column labeled, excreted by. Uric acid is shown as a six-membered ring that shares a double bond at its right side with the left side of a five-membered ring. The six-membered ring has C at its top vertex double bonded to O. N is substituted for C at the upper left vertex and bonded to H, forming the top atom in a light red box that extends to the bottom vertex of the ring. The lower left vertex is bonded to O H within the box, there is a double bond at the lower left side, and N is substituted for C at the bottom vertex, all within the light red box. All of the five-membered ring is enclosed within a light red box except for the upper and lower left vertices and the double bond between them that are all shared with the six-membered ring. The five-membered ring has N substituted for C at the upper right vertex, a double bond at the upper right side, C at the right side vertex bonded to O H, and N substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to H. Uric acid is excreted by primates, birds, reptiles, insects. An arrow labeled urate oxidase points down from uric acid to allantoin accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of one-half O 2 plus H 2 O and loss of C O 2. Allantoin has a similar structure to uric acid, but has several differences. There is no upper left side for the partial six-membered ring, N substituted for C at the upper left vertex at the top of the light red box is bonded to 2 H instead of one H, C at the lower left vertex is double bonded to O, there is no double bond at the lower left side, and N at the bottom vertex is bonded to H. This ends the part of the partial six-membered ring that is enclosed in the light red box. C at the lower right vertex is bonded to H, there is no double bond at the right side shared with the five-membered ring, and C at the top vertex is double bonded to O that is in the top vertex position. Apart from the upper and lower left sides, the parts of the five-membered ring that are not shared are enclosed in a light red box. N at the upper right vertex is bonded to H, there is no double bond at the upper right side, C at the right side vertex is double bonded to O, and N at the lower right vertex is bonded to H. Allantoin is excreted by most mammals. An arrow labeled allantoinase points down from allantoin to allantoate accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of H 2 O. Allantoate has parts in red boxes on either side of a central region. The central C is bonded to H, bonded to C O O minus above, and bonded to N H to the left and right that begins each light red box. To the left of the central C, the light red box includes N H bonded to C to the upper right bonded to N H 2 above a double bonded to O to the lower right. To the right of the central C, the light red box includes N H bonded to C to the upper right bonded to N H 2 above and double bonded to O to the lower right. Allantoate is excreted by bony fishes. An arrow labeled allantoicase points down from allantoate to urea and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is shown as a two-carbon vertical chain with the top C forming C O O minus and the bottom C forming C H O. 2 urea are formed. Urea is shown in a light red box as C bonded to N H 2 on each side and double bonded to O above. Urea is excreted by amphibians, cartilaginous fishes. An arrow labeled urease points down from urea to 4 N H 4 plus and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of 2 H 2 O and loss of 2 C O 2. N H 4 plus is excreted by marine invertebrates.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_mekyXRaYGU">The devastating effects of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome illustrate the importance of the salvage pathways. Hypoxanthine and guanine arise constantly from the breakdown of nucleic acids. In the absence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, PRPP levels rise and purines are overproduced by the de novo pathway, resulting in high levels of uric acid production and goutlike damage to tissue (see below). The brain is especially dependent on the salvage pathways, and this may account for the central nervous system damage in children with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This syndrome is another potential target for gene therapy. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Fi7GRWhpux" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

The joints become inflamed, painful, and arthritic, owing to the abnormal deposition of sodium urate crystals. The kidneys are also affected, as excess uric acid is deposited in the kidney tubules. Gout occurs predominantly in males. Its precise cause is not known, but it often involves an underexcretion of urate.

When xanthine oxidase is inhibited, the excreted products of purine metabolism are xanthine and hypoxanthine, which are more water-soluble than uric acid and less likely to form crystalline deposits.

Cancer cells have greater requirements for nucleotides as precursors of DNA and RNA, and consequently are generally more sensitive than normal cells to inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis. A number of important chemotherapeutic agents — for cancer and other diseases — act by inhibiting one or more enzymes in these pathways. Several well-studied examples can illustrate productive approaches to treatment and help us understand how these enzymes work.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ShBOfgiWps">Important targets for pharmaceutical agents include thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, enzymes that provide the only cellular pathway for thymine synthesis (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_swGfGRMq3x"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_0LY9Fpp1Cb" id="dav_9781319322342_hNnn1M8quj">Fig. 22-51</a></strong>). One inhibitor that acts on thymidylate synthase, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_jh96gndq1e">fluorouracil</dfn>, is an important chemotherapeutic agent. Fluorouracil itself is not the enzyme inhibitor. In the cell, salvage pathways convert it to the deoxynucleoside monophosphate FdUMP, which binds to and inactivates the enzyme. Inhibition by FdUMP (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_KyiLjtmW1V"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_oadIXddXld" id="dav_9781319322342_etsI3EuOm2">Fig. 22-52</a></strong>) is a classic example of mechanism-based enzyme inactivation. Another prominent chemotherapeutic agent, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_Ir1GIKW9yS">methotrexate</dfn>, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. This folate analog acts as a competitive inhibitor; the enzyme binds methotrexate with about 100 times higher affinity than dihydrofolate. <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_dVYomj5bE8">Aminopterin</dfn> is a related compound that acts similarly.</p>

This cycle is a major target of several chemotherapeutic agents. (b) Fluorouracil and methotrexate are important chemotherapeutic agents. In cells, fluorouracil is converted to FdUMP, which inhibits thymidylate synthase. Methotrexate, a structural analog of tetrahydrofolate, inhibits dihydrofolate reductase; the shaded amino and methyl groups replace a carbonyl oxygen and a proton, respectively, in folate. Another important folate analog, aminopterin, is identical to methotrexate except that it lacks the shaded methyl group. Trimethoprim, a tight-binding inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, was developed as an antibiotic.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_cNLDQl5Pqg">Two vertical series of reactions are shown. The left series of reactions is labeled U M P and the right-hand series of reactions Is labeled F d U M P. On the upper left, a blue enzyme is shown with a rounded invagination at the lower right. A five-membered ring is in the enzyme shown at the upper boundary of the invagination. The ring has C at the top vertex bonded to H in a red box to the upper right and bonded to C H 2 to the left further bonded to a wavy diagonal line; C at the upper right vertex bonded to 2 H; N substituted for C at the lower right vertex, labeled 10, and bonded to R prime; C at the lower left vertex bonded to 2 H extending into the opening with all three atoms enclosed in a gray box; and N at the upper left vertex with a red pair of electrons labeled 5 and bonded to the same wavy diagonal line to the left. B with a red pair of electrons is in the blue enzyme to the right. A six-membered ring in the opening has a top vertex double bonded to O; red highlighted C at the upper right vertex connected by a red bond to H; a red highlighted double bond at the right side; red highlighted C at the lower right vertex connected by a red bond to H; N substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to R; the lower left vertex double bonded to O; and N substituted for C at the upper left vertex and bonded to H. Red arrows point from the pair of electrons on the N numbered 5 at the upper left vertex of the five-membered ring in the enzyme to the bond between it and C in the gray box at the lower left vertex; from the bottom bond of the same ring to H plus in the open region; from red highlighted S minus bonded to the enzyme below to red highlighted C at the lower right vertex of the six-membered ring in the open region; and from the red highlighted double bond of the same ring to the red highlighted C at its upper right vertex. Text to the right reads, italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-methylene H subscript 4 end subscript folate. The illustration on the right is similar except that the upper right vertex of the six-membered ring in the opening is bonded to red highlighted F instead of red highlighted H. In both the left and right series of reactions, upward- and downward-pointing arrows show a reversible reaction. The downward arrow is joined by a curved arrow showing the addition of H plus and the upward arrow is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of H plus. Text in the middle reads, enzyme thiolate adds to C-6 of d U M P, a Michael-type addition; italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript is protonated, and italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript-iminium ion is formed from methylene H subscript 4 end subscript folate. On the left, the five-membered ring in the enzyme has lost its bottom bond; the N labeled 5 is now N plus and is double bonded to C below that had formed the lower left vertex of the ring; the N labeled 10 is not bonded to H. The six-membered ring within the opening now has red highlighted C at the right bottom vertex bonded to S of the enzyme below, still connected by a red bond to H to the right, and connected by a red single bond to red highlighted C minus at the upper right vertex that is still connected by a single red bond to H to its right. Red arrows point from C minus sat the upper right vertex to C in the gray box and from the double bond between C in the gray box and N plus above to the same N plus. In the reaction on the right, the illustration is similar except that red highlighted C minus at the upper right vertex of the six-membered ring in the opening is bonded to F instead of to H. In both the left and right series of reactions, upward- and downward-pointing arrows show a reversible reaction. The downward arrow is joined by a curved arrow showing the addition of H plus. Text in the middle reads, C-5 carbanion adds to italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript-iminium ion. There is now a single bond between C in the gray box and N above, which is now N plus and bonded to H and to C to the upper right to form a five-membered ring again. There is a red bond between red highlighted C at the upper right vertex of the ring in the opening and C in the gray box. Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on B in the enzyme to red highlighted H bonded to C at the upper right of the six-membered ring in the opening, from the bond between the same H and C, and from the bond between C in the gray box and N plus above to N plus. The structure on the right is similar, but there are no red arrows to show continuing reactions. Text below reads, Dead end covalent complex. On the left, upward- and downward-pointing arrows show a reversible reaction. Text in the middle reads, methylidene is formed at C-5 of pyrimidine; italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript is eliminated to form H subscript 4 end subscript folate. This yields a similar molecule in which N in the five-membered ring in the enzyme no longer has a charge, but has a red pair of electrons and is bonded to H. The six-membered ring in the opening now has a red double bond between C at the upper right vertex and C in the gray rectangle above, which is still bonded to 2 H with in the gray rectangle. Arrows point from the red pair of electrons on N to the adjacent bond at the lower right side of the five-membered ring, from the bond between C at the right side vertex of the five-membered ring and H in a light red box to C in the gray box, from the double bond between C at the upper right vertex of the six-membered ring and C in the gray box to the right side bond of the six-membered ring, and from the bond between C at the lower right vertex of the ring to S to the lower right. A longer downward-pointing arrow and slightly shorter upward-pointing arrow indicate a reversible reaction that yields d T M P. The downward arrow is accompanied by an arrow that branches off to show the loss of enzyme plus dihydrofolate. Text in the middle reads, 1,3 hydride shift generates d T M P and dihydrofolate. The enzyme is gone. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond at its right side, an upper right vertex bonded to C H 3, a top vertex double bonded to O, N substituted for C at the upper left vertex and bonded to H, a lower left vertex double bonded to O, and N substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to R.</p>
