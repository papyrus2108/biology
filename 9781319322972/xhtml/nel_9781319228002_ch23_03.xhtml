Skeletal muscle allows directed motion; adipose tissue stores and distributes energy in the form of fats, which serve as fuel throughout the body and as thermal insulation; in the brain, cells pump ions across their plasma membranes to produce electrical signals. The liver plays a central processing and distribution role in metabolism and furnishes all other organs and tissues with an appropriate mix of nutrients via the bloodstream. The functional centrality of the liver is indicated by the common reference to all other tissues and organs as “extrahepatic.” We therefore begin our discussion of the division of metabolic labor by considering the transformations of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats in the mammalian liver. This is followed by brief descriptions of the primary metabolic functions of adipose tissue, muscle, brain, and the tissue that interconnects all others: the blood.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_9OP7fDzEDZ">During digestion in mammals, the three main classes of nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) undergo enzymatic hydrolysis into their simple constituents (monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids). This breakdown is necessary because the epithelial cells lining the intestinal lumen absorb only relatively small molecules. Many of the fatty acids and monoacylglycerols released by digestion of fats in the intestine are reassembled within these epithelial cells into triacylglycerols (TAGs).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_VkN1BS1i10">After being absorbed, most sugars and amino acids and some reconstituted TAGs pass from intestinal epithelial cells into blood capillaries and travel in the bloodstream to the liver; the remaining TAGs enter adipose tissue via the lymphatic system. The portal vein (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vbxmRXUYOx" id="dav_9781319322342_QPrPNF3aFU">Fig. 23-9</a>) is a direct route from the digestive organs to the liver, and the liver therefore has first access to ingested nutrients. The liver has two main cell types. <span aria-label="849" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page849" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Kupffer cells are phagocytes, important in immune function. <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_hV2ajQU0fx"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_4gWdDaKfuA" id="dav_9781319322342_wVxcQEstB7" role="doc-glossref">Hepatocytes</a></dfn>, of primary interest here, transform dietary nutrients into the fuels and precursors required by other tissues and export them via the blood. The kinds and amounts of nutrients supplied to the liver are determined by the composition of the diet, the interval between meals, and several other factors. The demand of extrahepatic tissues for fuels and precursors varies from one organ to another, and it also varies with the level of activity and overall nutritional state of the individual.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9QJ7tTXzTa">To meet these changing circumstances, the liver has remarkable metabolic flexibility. For example, when the diet is rich in protein, hepatocytes synthesize more of the enzymes needed for amino acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis. Within hours after a shift to a high-carbohydrate diet, the levels of these enzymes begin to drop and the hepatocytes increase their synthesis of enzymes essential to carbohydrate metabolism and fat synthesis. Liver enzymes turn over (that is, are synthesized and degraded) at 5 to 10 times the rate of enzyme turnover in other tissues, such as muscle. Extrahepatic tissues also can adjust their metabolism to prevailing conditions, but none of these tissues is as adaptable as the liver, and none is so central to the organism’s overall metabolism.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_aYyiiASdhk">We turn now to a survey of the possible fates of sugars, amino acids, and lipids that enter the liver from the bloodstream.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_mPMRa7NeDy">The glucose transporter of hepatocytes (GLUT2) allows rapid, passive diffusion of glucose, so that the concentration of glucose in a hepatocyte is essentially the same as that in the blood. Glucose entering hepatocytes is phosphorylated by glucokinase (hexokinase IV) to yield glucose 6-phosphate. Glucokinase has a much higher <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_BIBKXBq0wS" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathalttext" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>m</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="upper K Subscript m" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch23_03EQ_0001.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> for glucose (10 m<span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_oXwQrduxIw">m</span>) than do the hexokinase isozymes in other cells (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch14_05.xhtml#page539" id="dav_9781319322342_7DViVxXRxN">p. 539</a>) and, unlike these other isozymes, it is not inhibited by its product, glucose 6-phosphate. The presence of glucokinase allows hepatocytes to continue phosphorylating glucose when the glucose concentration rises well above levels that would overwhelm other hexokinases. The high <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_M7riZlTvhV" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathalttext" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>m</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="upper K Subscript m" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch23_03EQ_0002.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> of glucokinase also ensures that the phosphorylation of glucose in hepatocytes is minimal when the glucose concentration is low, preventing the liver from consuming glucose as fuel via glycolysis. This spares glucose for other tissues. Fructose, galactose, and mannose, all absorbed from the small intestine, are also converted to glucose 6-phosphate by enzymatic pathways examined in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch14_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_BQ9uPL0Qin" id="dav_9781319322342_hwRc1ZTvZw">Chapter 14 (see Fig. 14-9)</a>. Glucose 6-phosphate is at the crossroads of carbohydrate metabolism in the liver. It may take any of several major metabolic routes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_TyQmPbljRw" id="dav_9781319322342_dP6G0xmSo0"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_d82iFR5NrF">Fig. 23-10</strong></a>), depending on the current metabolic needs of the organism. By the action of various allosterically regulated enzymes, and through hormonal regulation of enzyme synthesis and activity, the liver directs the flow of glucose into one or more of these pathways.</p>

The blood is adequately supplied with glucose just after the digestion and absorption of dietary carbohydrate or, between meals, by the conversion of liver glycogen to blood glucose. During the interval between meals, especially if prolonged, some muscle protein is degraded to amino acids. These amino acids donate their amino groups (by transamination) to pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to yield alanine, which <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_vAnrWJAQSu" role="presentation" src="../images/11.png"/> is transported to the liver and deaminated.

The amino acid deficit incurred in muscles is made up after the next meal by incoming dietary amino acids.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4rtxUv5lLF">Adipocytes have an active glycolytic metabolism, oxidize pyruvate and fatty acids via the citric acid cycle, and carry out oxidative phosphorylation. During periods of high carbohydrate intake, adipose tissue can convert glucose (via pyruvate and acetyl-CoA) to fatty acids, convert the fatty acids to TAGs, and store the TAGs as large lipid droplets — although in humans, much of the fatty acid synthesis occurs in hepatocytes. Adipocytes store TAGs arriving from the liver (carried in the blood as very-low-density lipoproteins) and from the intestinal tract (carried in chylomicrons), particularly after meals rich in fat.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZIIZwxQjmY">When the demand for fuel rises (between meals, for example), lipases in adipocytes hydrolyze stored TAGs <span aria-label="852" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page852" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to release FFAs, which can travel in the bloodstream to skeletal muscle, the heart, and, during starvation, the liver. The release of fatty acids from adipocytes is greatly accelerated by epinephrine, which stimulates the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of perilipin and thus gives lipases that are specific for tri-, di-, and monoacylglycerols access to TAGs in lipid droplets (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch17_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zIWFzSauA4" id="dav_9781319322342_IC7m3j0sG6">Fig. 17-2</a>). Hormone-sensitive lipase is also stimulated by phosphorylation. Insulin counterbalances this effect of epinephrine, decreasing the activity of the lipase.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6PoTgNABOC">The breakdown and synthesis of TAGs in adipose tissue constitute a substrate cycle; up to 70% of the fatty acids released by the three lipases are reesterified in adipocytes, re-forming TAGs. Each cycle consumes ATP (used to activate the fatty acids as acyl-CoA esters), so the net effect of the substrate cycling is the breakdown of ATP and the accompanying release of heat. In adipose tissue, glycerol liberated by adipocyte lipases cannot be reused in the synthesis of TAGs, because adipocytes lack glycerol kinase. Instead, the glycerol phosphate required for TAG synthesis is made from pyruvate by glyceroneogenesis, requiring the action of the cytosolic PEP carboxykinase (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_DIayOKM26i" id="dav_9781319322342_vrZUPGEoiv">Fig. 21-22</a>).</p>

Muscle in light activity uses blood glucose in addition to fatty acids. The glucose is phosphorylated, then degraded by glycolysis to pyruvate, which is converted to acetyl-CoA and oxidized via the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.</p>

Each glucose unit degraded yields three ATP, because phosphorolysis of glycogen produces glucose 6-phosphate (via glucose 1-phosphate), sparing the ATP normally consumed in the hexokinase reaction. Lactic acid fermentation thus responds more quickly than oxidative phosphorylation to an increased need for ATP, supplementing basal ATP production by aerobic oxidation of other fuels via the citric acid cycle and respiratory chain. The secretion of epinephrine, which stimulates both the release of glucose from liver glycogen and the breakdown of glycogen in muscle tissue, greatly enhances the use of blood glucose and muscle glycogen as fuels for muscular activity. (Epinephrine mediates the so-called fight-or-flight response, discussed more fully below.)</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_QvcuXP1Le4">Animal tissues that have a high and fluctuating need for ATP, primarily skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, contain several isozymes of creatine kinase. A cytosolic isozyme (cCK) is present in regions of high ATP use (myofibrils and sarcoplasmic reticulum, for example). By converting ADP produced during periods of high ATP use back to ATP, cCK prevents the accumulation of ADP to concentrations that could inhibit ATP-using enzymes by mass action. Another isozyme of creatine kinase is located in regions where the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria come into contact. This mitochondrial isozyme (mCK) probably serves to shuttle ATP equivalents produced in mitochondria to cytosolic sites of ATP use (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_FnGtbrgIJf" id="dav_9781319322342_tya5KpPF09">Fig. 1</a>). The species that diffuses from the mitochondrion to ATP-consuming activities in the cytosol is therefore creatine phosphate, not ATP. The mCK isozyme co-localizes with the adenine nucleotide transporter (in the inner mitochondrial membrane) and porin (in the outer mitochondrial membrane), which suggests that these three components may function together to transport ATP equivalents formed in mitochondria into the cytosol.</p>

Cytosolic CK can also use ATP produced by glycolysis to synthesize PCr. During periods of little ATP demand, the pools of ATP and PCr are replenished in preparation for the next period of intense demand for ATP. In resting muscle, the concentration of PCr is three to five times that of ATP, buffering the cell against rapid depletion of ATP during short bursts of ATP demand. [Information from U.

To maintain high creatine levels, these losses have to be compensated for, either by dietary creatine, obtained primarily from meat (muscle) and dairy products, or by de novo synthesis from glycine, arginine, and methionine (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_K7nQLSOaBb" id="dav_9781319322342_yl7fIya2Sh">Fig. 22-28</a>), which occurs primarily in liver and kidney. De novo synthesis of creatine is a major consumer of these amino acids, particularly in vegans, for whom this is the only source of creatine; plants do not contain creatine. Muscle tissue has a specific system to take up creatine (exported by liver or kidney) from the blood, against a substantial concentration gradient. Efficient uptake of dietary creatine requires continuous exercise; without exercise, creatine supplementation is of little value.</p>

The blood level of MB begins to rise within 2 hours of the heart attack, typically peaks 12 to 36 hours after the heart attack, and returns to normal levels in 3 to 5 days. Measurement of the MB isozyme in blood therefore confirms a diagnosis of heart attack and indicates approximately when it occurred.</p>
