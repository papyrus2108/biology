<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_1AUHnaWBhv">The eukaryotic cell is made up of many structures, compartments, and organelles, each with specific functions that require distinct sets of proteins and enzymes. These proteins (with the exception of those produced in mitochondria and plastids) are synthesized on ribosomes in the cytosol, so how are they directed to their final cellular destinations?</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_USuYtqjFB8">We are now beginning to understand this complex and fascinating process. Proteins destined for secretion, integration in the plasma membrane, or inclusion in lysosomes generally share the first few steps of a pathway that begins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins destined for mitochondria, chloroplasts, or the nucleus use three separate mechanisms. And proteins destined for the cytosol simply remain where they are synthesized. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_y4efMSrzeW" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> The thermodynamic cost of protein synthesis is magnified by the processes used by cells to transport proteins to their correct cellular locations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tCDNnHBcUT">The most important element in many of these targeting pathways is a short sequence of amino acids called a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_NzA278p62G"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fvkxFgOlEm" id="dav_9781319322342_aFOqqwVfv5" role="doc-glossref">signal sequence</a></dfn>, whose function was first postulated by Günter Blobel and colleagues in 1970. The signal sequence directs a protein to its appropriate location in the cell and, for many proteins, is removed during transport or after the protein has reached its final destination. In proteins slated for transport into mitochondria, chloroplasts, or the ER, the signal sequence is at the amino terminus of a newly synthesized polypeptide. In many cases, the targeting capacity of particular signal sequences has been confirmed by fusing the signal sequence from one protein to a second protein and showing that the signal directs the second protein to the location where the first protein is normally found. The selective degradation of proteins no longer needed by the cell also relies largely on a set of molecular signals embedded in each protein’s structure.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_iXWUCSOham">In this concluding section we examine protein targeting and degradation, emphasizing the underlying signals and molecular regulation that are so crucial to cellular metabolism. Except where noted, the focus is now on eukaryotic cells.</p>

The carboxyl terminus of the signal sequence is defined by a cleavage site, where protease action removes the sequence after the protein is imported into the ER. Signal sequences vary in length from 13 to 36 amino acid residues, but all have the following features: (1) about 10 to 15 hydrophobic amino acid residues; (2) one or more positively charged residues, usually near the amino terminus, preceding the hydrophobic sequence; and (3) a short sequence at the carboxyl terminus (near the cleavage site) that is relatively polar, typically having amino acid residues with short side chains (especially Ala) at the positions closest to the cleavage site.</p>

A piece of m R N A is shown with a short red 5 prime cap at the one o’clock position that becomes green and loops all the way around in an oval to the five o’clock position to end at A A A (A) italicized subscript n end italics end subscript 3 prime. Arrow 1 points to a ribosome near the start of this m R N A that has a pink half-circle on top with its flat base against a purple roughly rectangular piece below. m R N A runs through this purple part, where it is dark green and reads G U A. An arrow points left to a similar ribosome with a growing blue polypeptide extending into the pink region that ends with an orange piece labeled signal sequence. Arrow 2 points down to another ribosome at the nine o’clock position that has a longer blue polypeptide with the orange piece extending beyond the pink piece. A green rectangle labeled S R P is nearby and has a half-circle cutout at its lower end. Arrow 3 points down to a similar ribosome at the seven o’clock position that has a longer polypeptide and green S R P in the lower right pink part with its cutout facing outward. This is shown above structures in the yellow E R membrane. There are two adjacent vertical brown bars labeled ribosome receptor that each have curved cutouts on top, with the left-hand one curving down to the right and the right-hand one curving up to the left. A brown triangle is at the lower left of the left-hand brown bar. Each of these brown bars is connected to a brown vertical oval that crosses the membrane and that is labeled peptide translocation complex. There is a white oval vertical bar extending up from the membrane to the right of these brown bars. This white bar is shorter and more rounded and is labeled S R P receptor. An arrow labeled 4 points right and is accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of G T P. This yields a ribosome that is pushed against the ribosome receptors, which fit against its rounded lower pink side, and which has the S R P receptor fitted into he cutout in S R P. A bright blue diamond labeled signal peptidase is shown to the lower right of a brown oval peptide translocation complex. The blue polypeptide extends through the space between eh two ribosome receptors and coils within the lumen, ending at the orange signal sequence. Two arrows point from this ribosome. Arrow 5 curves upward accompanied by an arrow that branches off to show the loss of G D P plus P subscript i end subscript. It then continues up to show S R P and then loops back to the ribosome at the nine o’clock position that had not yet bound S R P. This is labeled the S R P cycle. Arrow 6 points to the right from the ribosome bound to the ribosome receptors. This yields a similar ribosome with a longer polypeptide inside the lumen that ends near the bright blue triangle with the orange signal sequence now separate beneath number 7. To the lower right, the full polypeptide is shown beneath empty ribosome receptors and an empty S R P receptor. Arrow 8 points up to show the pink and purple subunits of the ribosome separated at the three o’clock position. Arrow 9 points back up through m R N A to the start of arrow 1 to restart the cycle.

Arrow 2 is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of 5 G D P-M a n and loss of 5 G D P. This yields a similar structure in which the top blue square is bonded to a green circle bonded to one green circle on the right and to a chain of three green circles to the left. An arrow labeled 3 accompanied by the word translocation points down to the upper right side of the membrane to a similar structure that has changed position. The orange diamond is outside of the membrane and connected by a gray strand to P bonded to the rest of the same molecule inside of the E R. Arrow 4 points down and curves to the right accompanied by two curved arrows. The first curved arrow shows the addition of 4 dolichol bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to M a n and loss of 4 dolichol bonded to a circle labeled P. The second curved arrow shows the addition of 3 dolichol bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to G l y and loss of 3 dolichol bonded to a circle labeled P. This yields a similar molecule in which the bottom green circle is now bonded to a green circle on the right further bonded to two chains of two green circles each and is bonded to a green circle on the left further bonded to a chain of two green circles further bonded to a chain of three blue circles. Arrow 5 points right to show a blue polypeptide extending through the membrane to N H 3 with a positive charge on N at the top within the E R and with the bottom extending down to a ribosome on a green strand of m R N A running from its 5 prime end on the left to its 3 prime end on the right. Just above the place that the blue polypeptide crosses the membrane, it has a bond to A s n with a red pair of electrons. A red arrow points from this red pair of electrons back to the top P of the structure before arrow 5. Arrow 6 points to a similar polypeptide extending up from a ribosome but the polypeptide is longer and there is a bond from the piece of the strand where A s n had been shown previously to a blue square bonded to a blue square bonded to a green circle bonded to a green circle on the right further bonded to two chains of two green circles each and bonded to a green circle on the left further bonded to a chain of two green circles further bonded to a chain of three blue circles. Arrow 7 points right to show the polypeptide loose inside the E R. The two blue squares bonded to a green circle bonded to green circles to the upper left and right is highlighted in yellow. An orange diamond in the cytosol has its top vertex against the membrane and is connected by a gray strand to a chain of to circles labeled P within the E R. An arrow numbered 1 points right to show the same structure inverted at the three o’clock position so that the diamond is inside the membrane and the phosphates are outside of the membrane. An arrow points up with a curved arrow branching off labeled 9 dolichol phosphate recycled that shows the loss of P subscript i end subscript. The arrow points back to the original orange diamond within the E R with its top vertex against the lumen connected by a gray strand to a single P outside of the membrane. All data are approximate.</p>

These are separated by a horizontal boundary with ovals with yellow boundaries in between cylindrical structures. The ovals are labeled nuclear envelope. The cylindrical structures are labeled nuclear pore complex. Each is wider at the top and bottom, has sides made of ovals, has four vertical wavy threads extending upward, and has four vertical lines extending down to meet a curved horizontal line across the bottom boundary. Step 1: A nuclear protein is shown as a coiled blue strand with a red region labeled N L S. An arrow from this nuclear protein joins an arrow from two structures labeled importin. One is a dark green structure labeled beta that resembles an oval with a cutout in the top. It has a rectangular cutout in the center with angled sides to the left and right. The second is a light green structure labeled alpha with a rectangular base and protrusions to the upper left and right. These come together so that alpha fits into the cutout in beta and the red part of the nuclear protein fits against the curved top of alpha. An arrow points down to the left to show this structure above a nuclear pore complex next to the arrow 2 with an arrow pointing down through the nuclear pore complex to show the structure in the nucleoplasm. Two arrows point fro this structure. Arrow 3 points to a light green circle labeled R a n – G T P attached to the top of beta, from which another arrow labeled 5 points up through a second nuclear pore to show beta next to alpha, together labeled importin, ready to repeat the cycle. The other arrow points down to show alpha with the protein still attached. Arrow 4 points right and splits to show that the protein separates and alpha binds to a light green circle labeled R a n – G T P above and to an orange rectangle labeled C A S below. An arrow points from this structure back through a nuclear pore complex to show alpha ready to repeat the process. Two arrows point away from alpha and beta above the nuclear pore complex to the left. Both arrows point to a light green circle labeled R a n – G D P, but the bottom arrow has an arrow that branches off to show the loss of an orange rectangle labeled C A S. An arrow points to the right from R a n – G D P and is joined by a curved line from blue N T F 2, which resembles a rectangular with a half-circle cutout. These join together so that the curved bottom of N T F 2 fits against the top of R a n – G T P. This is labeled 6 and an arrow points through a nuclear pore complex to show the same structure in the nucleoplasm. Arrow 7 points down and is accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of G T P, next to a purple oval labeled R a n – G E F, and then two arrows that branch away to show the loss of N T F 2 and G D P. This yields R a n - G T P. Two arrows point away from R an – G T P. One points to the structure produced by arrow 4 in which R a n – G T P binds to alpha below, which is bound to C A S below, before this structure moves back through a nuclear pore complex to produce alpha ready to repeat the process. The second arrow points up to the product of arrow 3, R a n G T P bonded to beta below ready to follow arrow 5 back across the nuclear pore complex to produce beta ready to repeat the process. In part b, a micrograph shows a rough background containing many circular structures that are each about 0.2 micrometers in diameter. All data are approximate.</p>

Following translation, a protein to be exported may fold only slowly, the amino-terminal signal sequence impeding the folding. The soluble chaperone protein SecB binds to the protein’s signal sequence or other features of its incompletely folded structure. The bound protein is then delivered to SecA, a protein associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. SecA acts as both a receptor and a translocating ATPase. Released from SecB and bound to SecA, the protein is delivered to a translocation complex in the membrane, made up of SecY, E, and G, and is translocated stepwise through the membrane at the SecYEG complex in lengths of about 20 amino acid residues. Each step requires the hydrolysis of ATP, catalyzed by SecA.</p>

The clathrin lattice grows as more receptors are occupied by target proteins. Eventually, a complete membrane-bounded <span aria-label="1047" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1047" role="doc-pagebreak"/>endocytic vesicle is pinched off the plasma membrane with the aid of the large GTPase <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_xTQB1VEvc2">dynamin</dfn>, and it enters the cytoplasm. The clathrin is quickly removed by uncoating enzymes, and the vesicle fuses with an endosome. ATPase activity in the endosomal membranes reduces the pH therein, facilitating dissociation of receptors from their target proteins. In a related pathway, caveolin causes invagination of patches of membrane containing lipid rafts associated with certain types of receptors (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_kUJH9V28DT" id="dav_9781319322342_pXybrxPTgD">Fig. 11-23</a>). These endocytic vesicles then fuse with caveolin-containing internal structures called caveosomes, where the internalized molecules are sorted and redirected to other parts of the cell and the caveolins are prepared for recycling to the membrane surface. There are also clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathways; some make use of dynamin and others do not.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_bYPumvA1s6">Protein degradation is critical to overall cellular proteostasis, preventing the buildup of abnormal or unwanted proteins and permitting the recycling of amino acids. The half-lives of eukaryotic proteins vary from 30 seconds to many days. Most proteins turn over rapidly relative to the lifetime of a cell, although a few (such as hemoglobin) can last for the life of the cell (about 110 days for an erythrocyte). Rapidly degraded proteins include those that are defective because of incorrectly inserted amino acids or because of damage accumulated during normal functioning. And enzymes that act at key regulatory points in metabolic pathways often turn over rapidly.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_m3Uby6GQk6">Defective proteins and those with characteristically short half-lives are generally degraded in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells by selective ATP-dependent cytosolic systems.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_OE3qGqNtr3">Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is as important for the regulation of cellular processes as it is for the elimination of defective proteins. Many proteins required at only one stage of the eukaryotic cell cycle are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway after fulfilling their function. Ubiquitin-dependent destruction of cyclin is critical to cell-cycle regulation. The E1, E2, and E3 components of the ubiquitination pathway (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ja3gxMEN59" id="dav_9781319322342_QY4EAHKHRB">Fig. 27-47</a>) are large families of proteins. Different E1, E2, and E3 enzymes exhibit different specificities for target proteins and thus regulate different cellular processes. Some of these enzymes are highly localized in certain cellular compartments, reflecting a specialized function.</p>

An inability to degrade certain proteins that activate cell division (the products of oncogenes) can lead to tumor formation, and a too-rapid degradation of proteins that act as tumor suppressors can have the same effect. The ineffective or overly rapid degradation of cellular proteins also seems to play a role in a range of other conditions, including renal diseases, asthma, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases that are associated with the formation of characteristic proteinaceous structures in neurons. Cystic fibrosis is caused in some cases by a too-rapid degradation of a chloride ion channel, with resultant loss of function (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_nA90rax7c9" id="dav_9781319322342_czpPu26mtB">Box 11-2</a>).

Drugs designed to inhibit proteasome function are being developed as potential treatments for some of these conditions. Many bacterial pathogens have found ways to hijack the eukaryotic ubiquitination system, evolving enzymes that ubiquitinate and thus eliminate host proteins as required to facilitate infection. In a changing metabolic environment, protein degradation is as important to a cell’s survival as is protein synthesis, and much remains to be learned about these interesting pathways. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_Q11GYPWLq3" role="presentation" src="../images/square4.png"/></p>

In eukaryotic cells, one class of signal sequences is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds the signal sequence as soon as it appears on the ribosome and transfers the entire ribosome and incomplete polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum. Polypeptides with these signal sequences are moved into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen as they are synthesized.</li>

Defective proteins and those slated for rapid turnover are generally degraded by an ATP-dependent system. In eukaryotic cells, the proteins are first tagged by linkage to ubiquitin, a highly conserved protein. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, critical to the regulation of many cellular processes, is carried out by proteasomes, which also are highly conserved.</li>
