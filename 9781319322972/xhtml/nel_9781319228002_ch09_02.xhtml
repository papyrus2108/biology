<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_B60JGFt3TP">A researcher has isolated a new enzyme that she knows is the key to a human disease. She hopes to isolate large amounts of the protein to crystallize it for structural analysis and to study it. She wants to alter amino acid residues at its active site so that she can understand the reaction it catalyzes. She plans an elaborate research program to elucidate how this enzyme interacts with, and is regulated by, other proteins in the cell. All of this, and much more, becomes possible if she can isolate the gene encoding her enzyme. Unfortunately, that gene consists of just a few thousand base pairs within a human chromosome with a size measured in hundreds of millions of base pairs. How does she isolate the small segment that she needs and then study it? The answer lies in DNA cloning and methods developed to manipulate cloned genes.</p>

The coiled strand has a small red segment. Step 1: Cloning vector is cleaved with restriction endonuclease. This produces an uneven cut in the circular plasmid so that one side of the opening has a small rectangular projection from the bottom and the other side of the opening has a small rectangular projection from the top. Step 2: D N A fragment of interest is obtained by cleaving chromosome with the same restriction endonuclease. Four blue fragments of eukaryotic chromosome are shown, all with a rectangular projection on top on one side and on the bottom of the other side. This gives them a shape that fits perfectly into the opening in the plasmid. A fifth fragment of eukaryotic chromosome is red. Step 3: Fragments are ligated to the prepared cloning vector. An arrow points down accompanied by blue highlighted text reading, D N A ligase. This produces a recombinant vector, which is a circular plasmid with a red piece of eukaryotic chromosome filling the area that had been cut open. It is now a complete circle again. Step 4: D N A is introduced into the host cell. An arrow points down to a rod-shaped bacterial cell that has the plasmid containing a red piece of eukaryotic D N A on the right and a mass of thready host D N A on the left. Step 5: Propagation (cloning) of transformed cell produces many copies of recombinant D N A. Five rod-shaped bacterial cells are shown. All have thready host D N A. Three have one copy of the plasmid with eukaryotic D N A, one has two copies, and one has three copies.</p>

As Werner Arber discovered in the early 1960s, the biological function of restriction endonucleases is to recognize and cleave foreign DNA (the DNA of an infecting virus, for example); such DNA is said to be <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_rPh9zCde0d">restricted</i>. In the host cell’s DNA, the sequence that would be recognized by one of its own restriction endonucleases is protected from digestion by methylation of the DNA, catalyzed by a specific DNA methylase. The restriction endonuclease and the corresponding methylase are sometimes referred to as a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_5xYmbgALjM"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_UKbyKRO8aP" id="dav_9781319322342_oOenvgS2dA" role="doc-glossref">restriction-modification system</a></dfn>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_M8MpF0nqzj">There are three types of restriction endonucleases, designated I, II, and III. Types I and III are generally large, multisubunit complexes containing both the endonuclease and methylase activities. <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_9g8fJq2quE">Type II restriction endonucleases</strong>, first isolated by Hamilton Smith in 1970, are simpler, require no ATP, and catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of particular phosphodiester bonds in the DNA within the recognition sequence itself. The extraordinary utility of this group of restriction endonucleases was demonstrated by Daniel Nathans, who first used them to develop novel methods for mapping and analyzing genes and genomes.</p>

Fragments can be ligated to other DNAs, such as the cleaved cloning vector (a plasmid) shown here. This reaction is facilitated by the annealing of complementary sticky ends. Ligation is less efficient for DNA fragments with blunt ends than for those with complementary sticky ends, and DNA fragments with different (noncomplementary) sticky ends generally are not ligated. (b) DNA that has been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gEU06mzpAL" id="dav_9781319322342_F8r36MY44A">Fig. 8-33</a>) can be cloned. The primers can include noncomplementary ends that have a site for cleavage by a restriction endonuclease. Although these parts of the primers do not anneal to the target DNA, the PCR process incorporates them into the DNA that is amplified. Cleavage of the amplified fragments at these sites creates sticky ends, used in ligation of the amplified DNA to a cloning vector. (c) A synthetic DNA fragment with recognition sequences for several restriction endonucleases can be inserted into a plasmid that has been cleaved by a restriction endonuclease. The insert is called a linker; an insert with multiple restriction sites is generally called a multiple cloning site (MCS).</p>

The cloning vector is mostly circular but open on top. The left side has a top strand that ends with G and a bottom strand that has C paired with that G, then an unpaired sequence of T T A A. The right side has G on the bottom strand paired with C on the top strand. The top strand continues on beyond C with unpaired T T A A. The final product is the plasmid with the original horizontal D N A curved to fit into it. The unpaired bases on the plasmid match the sticky ends from the original plasmid, and multiple additional cloning sites are present in the piece of D N A.</p>

Many of the plasmids found in bacterial populations are little more than molecular parasites, similar to viruses but with a more limited capacity to transfer from one cell to another.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9UmjvFg6dx">The replication origins inserted in common plasmid vectors were originally derived from naturally occurring plasmids. As in pBR322, each of these origins is regulated to maintain a particular plasmid copy number. Depending on the origin used, the plasmid copy number can vary from one to hundreds or thousands per cell, providing many options for investigators. Two different plasmids cannot function in the same cell if they use the same origin of replication, because the regulation of one will interfere with the replication of the other. Such plasmids are said to be incompatible. When a researcher wants to introduce two or more different plasmids into a bacterial cell, each plasmid must have a different replication origin.</p>

Step 1: lowercase p uppercase B uppercase R 322 is cleaved in the bolded uppercase A lowercase m lowercase p superscript uppercase R end superscript end bold gene by uppercase P lowercase s lowercase t uppercase I. An arrow pointing downward is highlighted and labeled uppercase P lowercase s lowercase t uppercase I restriction endonuclease. The six plasmids are all shown cut in the middle of the green region labeled uppercase A lowercase m lowercase p superscript uppercase R end superscript, producing sticky ends on either side of an opening. Six pieces of red foreign D N A are shown that have overhanging ends to fit into the openings in the plasmids. Step 2: D N A fragments to be cloned are ligated into cleaved lowercase p uppercase B uppercase R 322. Where ligation is successful, the uppercase A lowercase m lowercase p superscript uppercase R end superscript gene is disrupted. The uppercase T lowercase e lowercase t superscript uppercase R end superscript gene remains intact. Arrows from the plasmids and foreign D N A come together next to a highlighted label reading, D N A ligase. This produces six plasmids. Three of the plasmids have red pieces of varying sizes within the green region of the uppercase A lowercase m lowercase p superscript uppercase R end superscript gene. Two plasmids do not contain any red, and the green sticky ends have joined back together without incorporating any new D N A. Step 3: Italics E. coli end italics cells are transformed, then grown on agar plates containing tetracycline to select for those that have taken up the plasmid. An arrow pointing downward is accompanied by text reading, transformation of italics E. coli end italics cells. Six rod-shaped bacterial are shown, each of which contains a mass of thready D N A. Three do not have a plasmid. One has a plasmid with no red region. Two have incorporated plasmids that have red regions within the green uppercase A lowercase m lowercase p superscript uppercase R end superscript gene. An arrow pointing downward to an agar plate is labeled, selection of transformed cells. Many small circular colonies are visible on the plate. A label pointing to the agar reads, agar containing tetracycline. Text next to the plate reads, all colonies have plasmids. Step 4: Individual colonies are transferred to matching positions on additional plates. One plate contains tetracycline, the other tetracycline and ampicillin. An arrow labeled colonies transferred to testing splits to point to the two plates. The left-hand plate is labeled agar containing tetracycline (control). Many large yellowish colonies are visible. The right-hand plate is labeled agar containing ampicillin plus tetracycline. Many colonies are in the same places on both plates. The colonies that are on the left-hand plate but not on the right-hand plate are labeled colonies with recombinant plasmids. Step 5: Cells that grow on tetracycline but not on tetracycline plus ampicillin contain plasmids with disrupted ampicillin resistance, hence the foreign D N A. Cells with lowercase p uppercase B uppercase R 322 without foreign D N A retain ampicillin resistance and grow on both plates.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_MFMNwpmEpM">Researchers sometimes want to clone much longer DNA segments than can typically be incorporated into standard plasmid cloning vectors such as pBR322. To meet this need, plasmid vectors have been developed with special features that allow the cloning of very long segments (typically 100,000 to 300,000 bp) of DNA. Once such large segments of cloned DNA have been added, these vectors are large enough to be thought of as chromosomes and are known as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_OrlFcbfJEF">bacterial artificial chromosomes</dfn>, or <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_A1emGVl2Sp">BACs</strong> (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_eKXo5biz1k"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fixYYk1ZHb" id="dav_9781319322342_9iSvd59doi">Fig. 9-5</a></strong>).</p>

Proteins are encoded by genes in DNA; alter the DNA in a gene, and one can alter the protein product of that gene. Biochemists use purified proteins for many purposes, including to elucidate protein function, study reaction mechanisms, generate antibodies to the proteins, reconstitute complex cellular activities in the test tube with purified components, and examine protein binding partners. With an increased understanding of the fundamentals of DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism and their regulation in a host organism such as <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_HACRa57sjS">E. coli</i> or yeast, investigators can manipulate cells to express cloned genes in order to study their protein products. The general goal is to alter the sequences around a cloned gene to trick the host organism into producing the protein product of the gene, often at very high levels. This overexpression of a protein can make its subsequent purification much easier.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_gU7rdpoJYx">We’ll use the expression of a eukaryotic protein in a bacterium as an example. Eukaryotic genes have surrounding sequences needed for their transcription and regulation in the cells they are derived from, but these sequences do not function in bacteria. Thus, eukaryotic genes lack the DNA sequence elements required for their controlled expression in bacterial cells: promoters (sequences that instruct RNA polymerase where to bind to initiate mRNA synthesis), ribosome-binding sites (sequences that allow translation of the mRNA to protein), and additional regulatory sequences. Appropriate bacterial regulatory sequences for transcription and translation must be inserted in the vector DNA at the correct positions relative to the eukaryotic gene.</p>

The regulatory sequences that govern gene expression in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_nNR5pECeWS">E. coli</i> and many other bacteria are well understood and can be harnessed to express cloned proteins at high levels. Bacteria are easy to store and grow in the laboratory, on inexpensive growth media. Efficient methods also exist to get DNA into bacteria and extract DNA from them. Bacteria can be grown in huge amounts in commercial fermenters, providing a rich source of the cloned protein.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_BFsjGh1NUK">Problems do exist, however. When expressed in bacteria, some heterologous proteins do not fold correctly, and many do not undergo the posttranslational modifications or proteolytic cleavage that may be necessary for their activity. Certain features of a gene sequence also can make a particular gene difficult to express in bacteria. For example, intrinsically disordered regions are more common in eukaryotic proteins. When expressed in bacteria, many eukaryotic proteins aggregate into insoluble cellular precipitates called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_mzBnQYYP2x">inclusion bodies</strong>. For these and many other reasons, some eukaryotic proteins are inactive when purified from bacteria or cannot be expressed at all. To help address some of these problems, researchers are regularly developing new bacterial host strains that include enhancements such as the engineered presence of eukaryotic protein chaperones or enzymes that modify eukaryotic proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_uzfOIG0bU7">There are many specialized systems for expressing proteins in bacteria. The well-characterized promoter and regulatory sequences associated with the lactose operon (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_u3IxJMHSEv" id="dav_9781319322342_uHP6ytzgQZ">Chapter 28</a>) are often fused to the gene of interest to direct transcription. The cloned gene will be transcribed when lactose is added to the growth medium. However, regulation in the lactose system is “leaky”: it is not turned off completely when lactose is absent — a potential problem if the product of the cloned gene is toxic to the host cells. Transcription from the Lac promoter is also not efficient enough for some applications.</p>

The gene encoding this polymerase is separately cloned into the same cell in a construct that affords tight regulation (allowing controlled production of the T7 RNA polymerase). The polymerase is also very efficient and directs high levels of expression of most genes fused to the T7 promoter.

The genes for both of these proteins can be replaced with the gene for a heterologous protein.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_LLM6D94cWt">The most convenient way to introduce cloned genes into a mammalian cell is with viruses. This method takes advantage of the natural capacity of a virus to insert its DNA or RNA into a cell, and sometimes into the cellular chromosome. A variety of engineered mammalian viruses are available as vectors, including human adenoviruses and retroviruses. The gene of interest is cloned so that its expression is controlled by a virus promoter. The virus uses its natural infection mechanisms to introduce the recombinant genome into cells, where the cloned protein is expressed. One advantage of these systems is that proteins can be expressed either transiently (if the viral DNA is maintained separately from the host cell genome and eventually degraded) or permanently (if the viral DNA is integrated into the host cell genome). With the correct choice of host cell, the proper posttranslational modification of the protein to its active form can be ensured. However, the growth of mammalian cells in tissue culture is very expensive, and this technology is generally used to test the function of a protein in vivo rather than to produce a protein in large amounts.</p>

An arrow pointing down is labeled, insert synthetic D N A segment containing mutation. A small green piece is added that has a vertical red bar in the middle labeled mutation. The new piece adds between the sticky ends to produce a circle with a vertical red bar in the green region. Part b shows oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. A plasmid is shown as two concentric rings. On the left side of each ring, there is a green bar labeled gene. A point in the middle of the outer green bar is labeled target site for mutation. An arrow pointing down is labeled denature plasmid and anneal oligonucleotide primers with mutation. Two small curved pieces, each an X across its middle, are labeled primers and are shown being added. This produces two rings, one larger than the other. The larger ring has a primer just to the inside of the gene, and the smaller ring has a primer just to the outside of the gene. An arrow pointing down is labeled use D N A polymerase to extend and incorporate the mutagenic primers. The left-hand ring is shown with a new inner ring that begins at the bottom of the primer, runs counterclockwise along the inside of the outer ring, and ends as an arrowhead pointing to the top of the ring.

When the GST gene sequence is fused to a target gene, the fusion protein acquires the capacity to bind glutathione. The fusion protein is expressed in a host organism such as a bacterium, and a crude extract is prepared. A column is filled with a porous matrix consisting of the ligand (glutathione) immobilized on microscopic beads of a stable polymer such as cross-linked agarose. As the crude extract percolates through this matrix, the fusion protein becomes immobilized by binding the glutathione. The other proteins in the extract are washed through the column and discarded. The interaction between GST and glutathione is tight but noncovalent, allowing the fusion protein to be gently eluted from the column with a solution containing either a higher concentration of salts or free glutathione to compete with the immobilized ligand for GST binding. The fusion protein is often obtained with good yield and high purity. In some commercially available systems, the tag can be entirely or largely removed from the purified fusion protein by a protease that cleaves a sequence near the junction between the target protein and its tag.</p>

Even if the tag is removed by a protease, one or a few extra amino acid residues can remain behind on the target protein, which may or may not affect the protein’s activity. The types of experiments to be carried out, and the results obtained from them, should always be evaluated with the aid of well-designed controls to assess any effect of a tag on protein function.</p>

(b) In quantitative PCR, or qPCR, careful monitoring of the progress of a PCR amplification allows one to determine when a DNA segment has been amplified to a specified threshold level. The amount of PCR product present is determined by measuring the level of a fluorescent probe attached to a reporter oligonucleotide complementary to the DNA segment that is being amplified. Probe fluorescence is not detectable initially, due to a fluorescence quencher attached to the same oligonucleotide. When the reporter oligonucleotide pairs with its complement in a copy of the amplified DNA segment, the fluorophore is separated from the quenching molecule and fluorescence results. As the PCR reaction proceeds, the amount of the targeted DNA segment increases exponentially, and the fluorescent signal also increases exponentially as the oligonucleotide probes anneal to the amplified segments. After many PCR cycles, the signal reaches a plateau as one or more reaction components become exhausted. When a segment is present in greater amounts in one sample than another, its amplification reaches a defined threshold level earlier. The “No template” line follows the slow increase in background signal observed in a control that does not include added sample DNA. CT is the cycle number at which the threshold is first surpassed.</p>
