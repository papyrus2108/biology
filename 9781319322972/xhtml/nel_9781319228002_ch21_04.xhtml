<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_LDbk0xPsaW">In <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_26EMinkbhS" id="dav_9781319322342_jmrBI1SUrl">Chapter 10</a> we introduced two major classes of membrane phospholipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Many different phospholipid species can be constructed by combining various fatty acids and polar head groups with the glycerol or sphingosine backbone (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dJuWkwV1uo" id="dav_9781319322342_EXS7ZwvJ8n">Figs. 10-8</a>, <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_hwcpDXQCGH" id="dav_9781319322342_XvJsfSovVl">10-11</a>). All the biosynthetic pathways follow a few basic patterns. In general, the assembly of phospholipids from simple precursors requires (1) synthesis of the backbone molecule (glycerol or sphingosine); (2) attachment of fatty acid(s) to the backbone through an ester or amide linkage; (3) addition of a hydrophilic head group to the backbone through a phosphodiester linkage; and, in some cases, (4) alteration or exchange of the head group or the fatty acids to yield the final phospholipid product.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_oIRQGTFTqg">In eukaryotic cells, phospholipid synthesis occurs primarily on the surfaces of the smooth ER and the inner mitochondrial membrane. Some newly formed phospholipids remain at the site of synthesis, but most are destined for other cellular membranes. Once they arrive, phospholipids can be remodeled within membranes to alter the fatty acid constituents. The process by which water-insoluble phospholipids move from the site of synthesis to the point of their eventual function is not fully understood, but we discuss some mechanisms that have emerged in recent years.</p>

Mice lacking LPCAT3 have a greatly reduced intake of fatty acids in the intestine, resulting in the release of gut hormones that control appetite. They are unable to survive on a high-fat diet, they resist eating, and they die of starvation unless the diet is changed. LPCATs play a demonstrable but still often mysterious role in processes from atherosclerosis to obesity to cancer, making these enzymes the subjects of increasing interest as research and drug targets. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_RVsmGr8jVK" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

The first few steps of this pathway occur in the ER; the attachment of head groups in stage 4 occurs in the Golgi complex. The pathway shares several features with the pathways leading to glycerophospholipids: NADPH provides reducing power, and fatty acids enter as their activated CoA derivatives. In cerebroside formation, sugars enter as their activated nucleotide derivatives. Head-group attachment in sphingolipid synthesis has several novel aspects. For example, phosphatidylcholine, rather than CDP-choline, serves as the donor of phosphocholine in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.</p>

Sphingolipid transfer proteins carry ceramide from the ER to the Golgi complex, where sphingomyelin synthesis occurs. Cytosolic proteins also bind phospholipids and sterols and transport them between cellular membranes (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qtXTNN7GeI" id="dav_9781319322342_NAaBzNI4x4">Fig. 11-7</a>). These mechanisms contribute to establishment of the characteristic lipid compositions of organelle membranes (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_hqJHEl8sJA" id="dav_9781319322342_5O1hEXm1ka">Fig. 11-5</a>).</p>

Either the diacylglycerol (strategy 1) or the head group (strategy 2) is activated by CDP.</li>

The major phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine are synthesized using strategy 1 in the mitochondria and strategy 2 in the ER and nucleus. Phosphatidylserine is derived from head-group exchange with phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine.</li>
