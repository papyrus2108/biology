<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Zn6hBM58os">Thus far we have focused on the general principles of catalysis and on introducing some of the kinetic parameters used to describe enzyme action. We now turn to several examples of specific enzyme reaction mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_iQvu6HC7mT">To understand the complete mechanism of action of a purified enzyme, we need to identify all substrates, cofactors, products, and regulators. We also need to know (1) the temporal sequence in which enzyme-bound reaction intermediates form, (2) the structure of each intermediate and each transition state, (3) the rates of interconversion between intermediates, (4) the structural relationship of the enzyme to each intermediate, and (5) the energy that all reacting and interacting groups contribute to the intermediate complexes and transition states. There are still only a few enzymes for which we have an understanding that meets all these requirements.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_iUgENRI6ta">Here we present the mechanisms for three enzymes: chymotrypsin, hexokinase, and enolase. These examples are not intended to cover all possible classes of enzyme <span aria-label="204" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page204" role="doc-pagebreak"/>chemistry. They have been chosen in part because they are among the best-understood enzymes and in part because they clearly illustrate some general principles outlined in this chapter. We present the chymotrypsin example in order to review some of the conventions used to depict enzyme mechanisms. Much mechanistic detail and experimental evidence is necessarily omitted; no one book could completely document the rich experimental history of these enzymes. In addition, we consider only briefly the special contribution of coenzymes to the catalytic activity of many enzymes. The function of coenzymes is chemically varied, and we describe each coenzyme in detail as it is encountered in our discussion of metabolism in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_pt02_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Fn7qRGKUut" id="dav_9781319322342_CE41lBb53a">Part II</a> of this book.</p>

It does not catalyze a direct attack of water on the peptide bond; instead, a transient covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed. The reaction thus has two distinct phases. In the acylation phase, the peptide bond is cleaved and an ester linkage is formed between the peptide carbonyl carbon and the enzyme. In the deacylation phase, the ester linkage is hydrolyzed and the nonacylated enzyme is regenerated.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_etQKDMUJN9">The first evidence for a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate came from a classic application of pre–steady state kinetics. In addition to its action on polypeptides, chymotrypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of small esters and amides. These reactions are much slower than hydrolysis of peptides because less binding energy is available with smaller substrates (the pre–steady state is also correspondingly longer), thus simplifying the analysis of the resulting reactions. In their investigations in 1954, B. S. Hartley and B. A. Kilby found that chymotrypsin hydrolysis of the ester <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_moesclmxjl">p</i>-nitrophenylacetate, as measured by release of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_utLRatmv5I">p</i>-nitrophenol, proceeds with a rapid burst before leveling off to a slower rate (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_DjoKo1k3KQ"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zwzrJOHtsD" id="dav_9781319322342_w4OAiyuqve">Fig. 6-25</a></strong>). By extrapolating back to zero time, they concluded that the burst phase corresponded to the release of just under one molecule of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_yocuSliyaJ">p</i>-nitrophenol for every enzyme molecule present (a small fraction of their enzyme molecules were inactive). Recall from <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_q2aLwvvDQL" id="dav_9781319322342_ZZeF6DA4EL">Figure 6-18</a> that a burst implies that the rate-limiting step of catalysis occurs after release of the product being monitored. Hartley and Kilby interpreted the burst to reflect a rapid release of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ATm2p0eL9b">p</i>-nitrophenol during a rapid acylation of all the enzyme molecules. They suggested that turnover of the enzyme was limited by a subsequent, slower deacylation step. Later work substantiated their hypothesis. The observation of a burst phase provides yet another example of the use of kinetics to break down a reaction into its constituent steps.</p>

The tetrahedral intermediates formed in the chymotrypsin reaction closely resemble, both energetically and structurally, the transition states leading to their formation and breakdown. However, the intermediate represents a committed stage of completed bond formation, whereas the transition state is part of the process of reaction. In the case of chymotrypsin, given the close relationship between the intermediate and the actual transition state, the distinction between them is routinely glossed over. Furthermore, the interaction of the negatively charged oxygen with the amide nitrogens in the oxyanion hole, often referred to as transition-state stabilization, also serves to stabilize the intermediate in this case. Not all intermediates are so short-lived that they resemble transition states. The chymotrypsin acyl-enzyme intermediate is much more stable and more readily detected and studied, and it is never confused with a transition state.</p>

Nucleophiles: An oxygen that is further bonded has a negative charge, and a highlighted arrow points from the minus sign to the right. Text reads, negatively charged oxygen (as in an unprotonated hydroxyl group or an ionized carboxylic acid). A sulfur that is further bonded has a negative charge, and a highlighted arrow points from the minus sign to the right. Text reads, negatively charged sulfhydryl. A carbanion is shown as C with three bonds and a minus on the fourth side with a highlighted arrow pointing from the minus sign to the right. An uncharged amine group has N with three bonds and a highlighted lone pair on the fourth side with a highlighted arrow pointing from them. Imidazole is shown as a five-membered ring with a bond extending from the upper left vertex, N H substituted for C at the bottom left vertex, double bonds at the top side and bottom right side, and N substituted for C at the bottom right vertex with a highlighted pair of electrons with a highlighted arrow pointing from them to the right. A hydroxide ion is shown as H bonded to O minus with a highlighted arrow pointing from the minus sign to the right. Electrophiles: C is shown with bonds extending to the left and right and a double bond to O below. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond to O and R with a highlighted pair of electrons above has a highlighted arrow pointing to the open side of the C. Text reads, carbon atom of a carbonyl group (the more electronegative oxygen of the carbonyl group pulls electrons away from the carbon). C with two bonds extending to the left is double bonded to N plus on the right that is further bonded to something else and to H below. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond to the N. R above had a highlighted pair of electrons and a highlighted arrow pointing to the C. Text reads, protonated imine group (activated for nucleophilic attack at the carbon by protonation of the amine). P is shown with O single bonded to three sides and double bonded to the fourth side. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond to the adjacent O. R with a highlighted pair of electrons has a highlighted arrow pointing to P. Text reads, phosphorus of a phosphate group. H plus is shown with R with a highlighted pair of electrons and a highlighted arrow pointing to H. Text reads, proton. To the right of the table, a box reads, How to read reaction mechanisms—a refresher. Chemical reaction mechanisms, which trace the formation and breakage of covalent bonds, are communicated with dots and arrows, a convention known informally as “electron pushing.” A covalent bond consists of a shared pair of electrons. Nonbonded electrons important to the reaction mechanism are designed by dots (bonded O H with a highlighted pair of dots above O). Curved arrows (curved highlighted arrow) represent the movement of electron pairs. For movement of a single electron (as in a free radical reaction), a single-headed (fishhook-type) arrow is used (a curved highlighted arrow is shown with only one head). Most reaction steps involve an unshared electron pair (as in the chymotrypsin mechanism). Some atoms are more electronegative than others; that is, they more strongly attract electrons. The relative electronegativities of atoms encountered in this text are F greater than O greater than N greater than C approximately equal to S greater than P approximately equal to H. For example, the two electron pairs making up a C to O double bond (carbonyl) bond are not shared equally; the carbon is relatively electron-deficient as the oxygen draws away the electrons. Many reactions involve an electron-rich atom (a nucleophile) reacting with an electron-deficient atom (an electrophile). Some common nucleophiles and electrophiles in biochemistry are shown at right. In general, a reaction mechanism is initiated at an unshared electron pair of a nucleophile. In mechanism diagrams, the base of the electron-pushing arrow originates near the electron-pair dots, and the head of the arrow points directly at the electrophilic center being attacked. Where the unshared electron pair confers a formal negative charge on the nucleophile, the negative charge symbol itself can represent the unshared electron pair and serves as the base of the arrow. In the chymotrypsin mechanism, the nucleophilic electron pair in the E S complex between steps 1 and 2 is provided by the oxygen of the S e r superscript 195 hydroxyl group. This electron pair (2 of the 8 valence electrons of the hydroxyl oxygen) provides the base of the curved arrow. The electrophilic center under attack is the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond to be cleaved. The C, O, and N atoms have a maximum of 8 valence electrons, and H has a maximum of 2. These atoms are occasionally found in unstable states with less than their maximum allotment of electrons, but C, O, and N cannot have more than 8. Thus, when the electron pair from chymotrypsin’s S e r superscript 195 attacks the substrate’s carbonyl carbon, an electron pair is displaced from the carbon valence shell (you cannot have 5 bonds to carbon!). These electrons move toward the more electronegative carbonyl oxygen. The oxygen has 8 valence electrons both before and after this chemical process, but the number shared with the carbon is reduced from 4 to 2, and the carbonyl oxygen acquires a negative charge. In step 3, the electron pair conferring the negative charge on the oxygen moves back to re-form a bond with carbon and reestablish the carbonyl linkage. Again, an electron pair must be displaced from the carbon, and this time it is the electron pair shared with the amino group of the peptide linkage. This breaks the peptide bond. The remaining steps follow a similar pattern.</p>

The extremely successful therapies developed to treat HIV infection provide a case in point. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the agent that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 2018, 38 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection, with about 1.7 million new infections that year and approximately 770,000 fatalities. AIDS first surfaced as a worldwide epidemic in the 1980s; HIV was discovered soon after and was identified as a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_L7JV3IlasW"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_IcTYVkgF3I" id="dav_9781319322342_eIhR74cOok" role="doc-glossref">retrovirus</a></dfn>. Retroviruses possess (1) an RNA genome and (2) an enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is capable of using RNA to direct the synthesis of a complementary DNA. Efforts to understand HIV and develop therapies for HIV infection benefited from decades of basic research, both on enzyme mechanisms and on the properties of other retroviruses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_KooDlwCOAr">A retrovirus such as HIV has a relatively simple life cycle (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_3BSfzIk6Sn" id="dav_9781319322342_GLlJL0QGn2">Fig. 26-29</a>). Its RNA genome is converted to duplex DNA in several steps catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase (described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_W0pJmvMJNZ">Chapter 26</a>). The duplex DNA is then inserted into a chromosome in the nucleus of the host cell by the enzyme integrase (described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_TqEuTWjF97">Chapter 25</a>). The integrated copy of the viral genome can remain dormant indefinitely. Alternatively, it can be transcribed back into RNA, which can then be translated into proteins to construct new virus particles. Most of the viral genes are translated into large polyproteins, which are cut by an HIV protease into the individual proteins needed to make the virus (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_MTXID989z9" id="dav_9781319322342_G79BQ3X7FG">Fig. 26-30</a>).

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_O51VYjzfQq">There are four major subclasses of proteases. The serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin and trypsin, and the cysteine proteases (in which a Cys residue serves a catalytic role similar to that of Ser in the active site) form covalent enzyme-substrate complexes; the aspartyl proteases and metalloproteases do not. The HIV protease is an aspartyl protease. Two active-site Asp residues facilitate the direct attack of a water molecule on the carbonyl group of the peptide bond to be cleaved (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_jsAb8QGqqo"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_WDojnO6y3A" id="dav_9781319322342_hK6QWprnsT">Fig. 6-28</a></strong>). The initial product of this attack is an unstable tetrahedral intermediate, much like that in the chymotrypsin reaction. <span aria-label="209" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" role="doc-pagebreak"/><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_8eDGLnZj69" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> This intermediate is close in structure and energy to the reaction transition state. The drugs that have been developed as HIV protease inhibitors form noncovalent complexes with the enzyme, but they bind to it so tightly that they can be considered irreversible inhibitors. The tight binding is derived in part from their design as transition-state analogs. The success of these drugs makes a point worth emphasizing: the catalytic principles we have studied in this chapter are not simply abstruse ideas to be memorized — their application saves lives.</p>

The adjacent hydroxyl group mimics the negatively charged oxygen in the tetrahedral intermediate in the normal reaction, providing a transition-state analog that facilitates very tight binding.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eOYY5pEHq6">This model has been reinforced by kinetic studies. The five-carbon sugar xylose, stereochemically similar to glucose but one carbon shorter, binds to hexokinase but in a position where it cannot be phosphorylated. Nevertheless, addition of xylose to the reaction mixture increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Evidently, the binding of xylose is sufficient to induce a change in hexokinase to its active conformation, and the enzyme is thereby “tricked” into phosphorylating water. The hexokinase reaction also illustrates that <span aria-label="210" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" role="doc-pagebreak"/>enzyme specificity is not always a simple matter of binding one compound but not another. In the case of hexokinase, specificity is observed not in the formation of the ES complex but in the relative rates of subsequent catalytic steps. Reaction rates increase greatly in the presence of a substrate, glucose, that is able to accept a phosphoryl group.</p>

It contains a three-carbon molecule, 2-phosphoglycerate, with C 1 double bonded to O, and single bonded to O minus. Dotted lines connect both of these O to an M lowercase G superscript 2 plus to the left, and the top O is also connected by a dotted line to a second M lowercase G 2 plus above. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond connecting C 1 to O and the O. C 2 is bonded above to O further bonded to P O subscript 3 superscript 2 minus and below to blue highlighted H. A highlighted arrow points from the bond between C 2 and blue H to the bond between C 1 and C 2. C 3 is bonded to H above, H to the right, and red O H below. There are two molecules beneath this molecule, within the enolase. L y s superscript 3 4 5 is shown with N above that has H on the left, H on the right, and a highlighted pair of electrons above. An arrow points from the highlighted electrons to the blue H within the enzyme. To the right, G l u superscript 211 is shown with C above that is double bonded to O and bonded to an O H that is directly below the red highlighted O H in the enzyme. Text below reads, 2-phosphoglycerate bound to enzyme. Step 1: L y s superscript 345 abstracts a proton by general base catalysis. Two M lowercase G superscript 2 plus ions stabilize the resulting enolate intermediate. This reaction produces an enolate intermediate that is similar to the first structure, except for the following. L y s superscript 345 is shown with N plus above that is bonded to H on the left, H on the right, and blue H above. C 1 is single bonded to two O minus and is double bonded to C 2. A highlighted arrow points from the minus on the bottom O bonded to C 1 to the bond between that O and C 1. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond between C 1 and C 2 to the bond between C 2 and C 3. A highlighted arrow points from the bond between C 3 and red highlighted O H to the H of the O H of G l u superscript 211. Step 2: G l u superscript 211 facilitates elimination of the bonded O H group by general acid catalysis. During this reaction, H bonded to red highlighted O H is lost. The product is phosphoenolpyruvate, which has C 1 bonded to O minus above and double bonded to O below on the left, C 2 bonded to O that is further bonded to P O subscript 3 superscript 2 minus and double bonded to C 3, and C 3 that is bonded to 2 H. Part b shows enolase as a dark roughly oval structure that is wider on the top than on the bottom. 2-P G A is shown inside it with a three-carbon chain that has two O on the left adjacent to two large circles labeled M lowercase G superscript 2 plus that are behind and outside of the enzyme. C 1 is bonded to these two O atoms. C 2 is bonded to an O behind that is further bonded to P that projects toward the observer with three attached Os, one of which is near the top M lowercase G superscript 2 plus. C 3 is to the right with O behind it, away from the observer. L y s superscript 345 is shown below as a chain of four carbons extending from a larger molecule in the lower left corner and with an N that is adjacent to the bottom M lowercase G superscript 2 plus. G l u superscript 211 is shown to the right as a chain of four carbons. The far left carbon is bonded to two O that are to the left, facing the enzyme. On the right, bonds extend from either side of the last carbon visible before the molecule extends out of the frame.</p>

The red hexagon has a bond extending from its left vertex and the green hexagon has a bond extending from its right vertex. This pair of hexagons is contained within parentheses with subscript lowercase N to the right and with dots extending horizontally to each side, suggesting further bonding. A bond extends down from the lower left vertex of the right-hand green hexagon, connecting it to L-A l a. L-A l a is bonded to D-G l u, which is further bonded to L-L y s within parentheses.

A curved arrow points from the highlighted pair of electrons to the C double bonded to O at the bottom left vertex of the four-membered ring. A second curved arrow points from the bottom bond of the four-membered ring to the H of the O H with the highlighted pair of electrons. The product of this reaction is a stably derivatized, inactive transpeptidase. The molecule has a similar structure except that the bottom bond of the four-membered ring is gone, N at the lower right vertex of the four-membered ring is bonded to H, and C at the lower left vertex of the four-membered ring is double bonded to O and single bonded to O connected to S e r bonded to transpeptidase.</p>

This leads to a rearrangement that creates a much more reactive derivative, which is subsequently attacked by another nucleophile in the active site to irreversibly acylate the enzyme and inactivate it. Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid are combined in a widely used pharmaceutical formulation with the trade name Augmentin. The cycle of chemical warfare between humans and bacteria continues unabated. Strains of disease-causing bacteria that are resistant to both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have been discovered. Mutations in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_X7Yz019aZb">β</i>-lactamase within these strains render it unreactive to clavulanic acid. The development of new antibiotics promises to be a growth industry for the foreseeable future. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_EW3pMkUpnA" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_VEsnkHk0dD">Part a shows penicillin as a square four-membered ring with a substituent bonded to its upper left vertex and joined on its right side to a five-membered ring. The four-membered ring has a side-chain solid wedge bonded to its upper left vertex and extending to the left. The side chain has N H bonded to C double bonded to O that is further bonded to R on its left side. The ring has C double bonded to O at its lower left vertex, N at its lower right vertex, C hashed wedge bonded to H at its top right vertex, and C hashed wedge bonded to H at its top left vertex. The five-membered ring shares its top left and bottom left vertices with the four-membered ring. C at the top left vertex is solid wedge bonded to S at the top vertex. C at the right side vertex is solid wedge bonded to C H 3 and hashed wedge bonded to C H 3. C H at the bottom right vertex is hashed wedge bonded to C O O H. Greek letter beta lactamase is present on the lower left. S e r is shown extending from it and connected to O H that has a highlighted pair of electrons. A curved arrow points from the highlighted pair of electrons to the C double bonded to O at the bottom left vertex of the five-membered ring. A second curved arrow points from the bottom bond of the four-membered ring to the H of the O H with the highlighted pair of electrons. A reaction occurs. The product has a similar structure, except that the bottom bond of the four-membered ring is gone, N at the lower right vertex of the four-membered ring is bonded to H, and C at the lower left vertex of the four-membered ring is double bonded to O and single bonded to O connected to S e r bonded to Greek letter beta lactamase. This molecule undergoes a reaction with the addition of H 2 O and the loss of Greek letter beta lactamase. The product, labeled inactive penicillin, has a similar structure, except that the C at the lower left vertex of the four-membered ring is double bonded to O and bonded to O minus. Part b shows clavulanic acid as a square four-membered ring joined on its right side to a five-membered ring. The five-membered ring has a C bonded to 2 H at its upper left vertex and extending to the left. The ring has C double bonded to O at its lower left vertex, N at its lower right vertex, and C hashed wedge bonded to H at its top right vertex. The five-membered ring shares its top left and bottom left vertices with the four-membered ring. It has O at its top vertex, C at its right side vertex that is double bonded to C that is further bonded to H and to C H 2 O H, and C H at its lower right vertex that is hashed wedge bonded to C O O H. An oval shape labeled Greek letter beta lactamase is shown to the lower left. S e r is shown extending from it and connected to O H that has a highlighted pair of electrons. A curved arrow points from the highlighted pair of electrons to the C double bonded to O at the bottom left vertex of the five-membered ring. A second curved arrow points from the bottom bond of the four-membered ring to the right side bond of the four-membered ring that it shares with the five-membered ring. A third curved arrow points from the top left bond of the five-membered ring to the top right bond of the five-membered ring, between O and C. A fourth curved arrow points from the double bond between C at the right side vertex of the five-membered ring and the first C of the side chain to an H plus below. The product of this reaction has a similar structure, except that the O with the highlighted electrons is now bonded to the C that had formed the lower left vertex of the five-membered ring, there is no bottom bond on the former four-membered ring, there is a double bond between C and N on the right side of the former four-membered ring that it shared with the former five-membered ring, the top left bond of the former five-membered ring is gone, the O at the top vertex of the former five-membered ring is double bonded to C at the former right side vertex of the same former ring, and the same C at the former right side vertex is double bonded to the first C of the side chain, which is now bonded to C H 2 O H, H, and H. Curved arrows are shown from the bond between C and H at the former top left vertex of the four-membered ring and the top bond of the same former ring and from the double bond between C and N and an H plus below. This reacts to produce a similar structure, except that C at the top left vertex of the former four-membered ring is now bonded to 1 H, single bonded to C below that is double bonded to O and bonded to O extending from S e r to the left, and double bonded to C at the top right vertex of the former four-membered ring. The C at the top right vertex of the former four-membered ring is now single bonded to N H below. A highlighted arrow points from the double bond between C at the top left and C at the top right of the former four-membered ring and the bond between the former (C at the top left) and C that had been at the lower left vertex. A second highlighted arrow points from the double bond between C that had been at the lower left vertex of the former four-membered ring and O to the O. A third highlighted arrow points from two highlighted electrons on N u attached to Greek letter beta lactamase to C at the top right vertex of the former four-membered ring. This produces an inactive Greek letter beta lactamase.</p>
