<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_PVpx7TL5Eq">Biochemists’ understanding of protein structure and function has been derived from the study of many individual proteins. To study a protein in detail, the researcher must be able to separate it from other proteins in pure form and must have the techniques to determine its properties. The necessary methods come from protein chemistry, a discipline as old as biochemistry itself and one that retains a central position in biochemical research.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_R0lqN23Oly">A pure preparation is usually essential before a protein’s properties and activities can be determined. Given that cells contain thousands of different kinds of proteins, how can one protein be purified? <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_WMPldIEa6D" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01c.png"/> Methods for separating proteins take advantage of properties that vary from one protein to the next, including size, charge, and binding properties. The advent of genetic engineering approaches has provided new and simpler paths for protein purification. The latter methods, described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_iNKSWEBZuH" id="dav_9781319322342_4d4QE2QIwe">Chapter 9</a>, often artificially modify the protein being purified, adding a few or many amino acid residues to one or both ends. In many cases, the modifications alter protein function. Isolation of unaltered native proteins requires removal of the modification or a reliance on methods described here.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_GtyMAgV0Bz">The source of a protein is generally tissue or microbial cells. The first step in any protein purification procedure is to break open these cells, releasing their proteins into a solution called a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_BamC19zA1x">crude extract</dfn>. If necessary, differential centrifugation can be used to prepare subcellular fractions or to isolate specific organelles (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch01_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ly21qj2jDI" id="dav_9781319322342_0YxrVew4lk">Fig. 1-7</a>).</p>

Early fractionation steps in a purification utilize differences in protein solubility, which is a complex function of pH, temperature, salt concentration, and other factors. The solubility of proteins is lowered in the presence of some salts, an effect called “salting out.” Ammonium sulfate <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_7HLYLxzSjU" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text201" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>((NH</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn></msub><msub><mtext>)</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mrow><mtext>SO</mtext></mrow><mn>4</mn></msub><mtext>)</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="left-parenthesis left-parenthesis NH Subscript 4 Baseline right-parenthesis Subscript 2 Baseline SO Subscript 4 Baseline right-parenthesis" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch03_04EQ_0001.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> is particularly effective for selectively precipitating some proteins while leaving others in solution.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_cKRqJ5BLo1">A solution containing the protein of interest usually must be further altered before subsequent purification steps are possible. For example, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_s5PZ9PKXzs"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_LALlC4PcXH" id="dav_9781319322342_Dyoz1OlqTN" role="doc-glossref">dialysis</a></dfn> is a procedure that separates proteins from small solutes by taking advantage of the proteins’ larger size. The partially purified extract is placed in a bag or tube made of a semipermeable membrane, which is suspended in a much larger volume of buffered solution of appropriate ionic strength. The membrane allows the exchange of salt and buffer but not proteins. Thus dialysis retains large proteins within the membranous bag or tube while allowing the concentration of other solutes in the protein preparation to change until they come into equilibrium with the solution outside the membrane. Dialysis might be used, for example, to remove ammonium sulfate from the protein preparation.</p>

A porous solid material with appropriate chemical properties (the stationary phase) is held in a column, and a buffered solution (the mobile phase) migrates through it. The protein, dissolved in the same buffered solution that was used to establish the mobile phase, is layered on the top of the column. The protein then percolates through the solid matrix as an ever-expanding band within the larger mobile phase. Individual proteins migrate faster or more slowly through the column, depending on their properties.</p>

A solution, the mobile phase, flows through the matrix, the stationary phase. The solution that passes out of the column at the bottom (the effluent) is constantly replaced by solution supplied from a reservoir at the top. The protein solution to be separated is layered on top of the column and allowed to percolate into the solid matrix. Additional solution is added on top. The protein solution forms a band within the mobile phase that is initially the depth of the protein solution applied to the column. As proteins migrate through the column (shown here at five different times), they are retarded to different degrees by their different interactions with the matrix material. The overall protein band thus widens as it moves through the column. Individual types of proteins (such as A, B, and C, shown in blue, red, and green) gradually separate from each other, forming bands within the broader protein band. Separation improves (i.e., resolution increases) as the length of the column increases. However, each individual protein band also broadens with time due to diffusional spreading, a process that decreases resolution. In this example, protein A is well separated from B and C, but diffusional spreading prevents complete separation of B and C under these conditions. Protein C is being detected and its presence recorded as it is eluted from the column.</p>

There is a small tan region, then a series of colored bands, then more tan material. The colored bands are less than one fourth of the length of the cylinder and, from top to bottom, are gray, blue, red, green, and gray. In each cylinder, these bands become more distinct, larger, and lower in the cylinder.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_iaLWNTHokr">All of the parts show a long, narrow vertical cylinder, the column, with two discs above, a larger one beneath a smaller one, connected by a very narrow cylinder to a thick disc that leads to a tube that bends horizontally left through a rectangle labeled pump before bending vertically into an Erlenmeyer flask filled over halfway with liquid. At the bottom, the main column has a thick disc above a small thin cylinder that leads to a tiny tube from which a drop falls into a test tube in a horizontal row of test tubes. Part a, ion-exchange chromatography, shows that the tube contains many small spheres forming four differently colored bands. A close-up of the top band shows a background of many large spheres with negative charges labeled, resin interacting with spheres labeled, protein. The small spheres each have two plus symbols adjacent to the large spheres and a single minus sign on the opposite side. Text beneath this close-up reads, polymer beads with negatively charged functional groups. Text along the top of the column reads, protein mixture is added to column containing cation exchangers. A key shows that, from top to bottom, the bands of spheres represent particles with large net positive charge, net positive charge, net negative charge, and large net negative charge. Text beneath the key reads, Proteins move through the column at rates determined by their net charge at the p H being used. With cation exchangers, proteins with a more negative charge move faster and elute earlier. There are six numbered test tubes lined up horizontally beneath the column. The left three are each three-quarters full of liquid. Tube 3 contains three spheres with large net negative charge. Tube 4 is beneath the output tube from the column and the drop of liquid is falling into it. It is half full of liquid and contains two spheres with large net negative charge. Tubes 5 and 6 to the right are empty. Part b, size-exclusion chromatography, has three horizontal bands across the column with small spheres at the top, intermediate spheres in the center, and large spheres at the bottom. A close-up of the region with small spheres at the top shows large spheres representing polymer beads with three beads cut open to show the interior located in front of the other spheres. A medium sized sphere is shown passing to the left of the cutaway beads. A large sphere is shown passing to the right of the cutaway beads, near the bottom of the frame. Inside of the beads, narrow tubular passages twist and turn. The small spheres are shown moving downward through these. The close-up is labeled, porous polymer beads. Text to the top right of the column reads, protein mixture is added to column containing cross-linked polymer. Text to the bottom right of the column reads, protein molecules separate by size. Small molecules take labyrinthine paths through pores in the beads; larger molecules, excluded from the pores, pass freely around the beads and elute earlier. There are six numbered test tubes lined up horizontally beneath the column. The left three tubes each are three-quarters full of liquid. The third tube also contains three of the large spheres. Tube 4 is about half full of liquid and contains two large spheres. Tubes 5 and 6 are empty. Part c, affinity chromatography, shows two columns. The left-hand column has spheres with a small cutout on one side near the top of the column, a region with no spheres in the middle of the column, and a mix of very small and small spheres at the bottom of the column. A close-up of the top of the column shows many large spheres with one highlighted in front. To its left, a very small sphere from the column travels down. A small sphere passes to its right. Spherical ligands project from the surface of the large, highlighted sphere and some of these are next to the spheres with cutouts that are labeled, protein of interest. Text to the right of the column reads, protein mixture is added to column containing a polymer-bound ligand specific for protein of interest. There are nine numbered test tubes lined up horizontally beneath the column. The first three tubes are about three-quarters full of liquid. The third tube also contains three small spheres and three very small spheres from the bottom of the column. Tube 4 is half full of liquid and contains one small sphere and two very small spheres. Tubes 5 through 9 are empty. Text reads, unwanted proteins are washed through column. An arrow points from the column to a similar column on the right representing a later stage. The Erlenmeyer flask contains many red spheres and text reads, solution of ligand is added to column. The column appears empty at the top and shows a band of the protein of interest bound to the ligand at the bottom. A close-up of the top of the column shows that the highlighted sphere still has ligands but no longer has any bound protein of interest. The same nine test tubes are shown. Tubes 1 through 3 are unchanged. Tube 4 now contains three small spheres and three very small spheres from the first column. Tubes 5 and 6 are three-quarters full of water. Tube 7 contains two of the protein of interest bound to the ligand. Tubes 8 and 9 are empty.</p>

In this method, large proteins emerge from the column sooner than small ones — a somewhat counterintuitive result. The solid phase consists of cross-linked polymer beads with engineered pores or cavities of a particular size. Large proteins cannot enter the cavities and so take a shorter (and more rapid) path through the column, around the beads. Small proteins enter the cavities and are slowed by their more labyrinthine path through the column. Size-exclusion chromatography can also be used to approximate the size of a protein being purified, using methods similar to those described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ObFlGw6fmK" id="dav_9781319322342_sWh5eFL2IO">Figure 3-19</a>.</p>

The beads in the column have a covalently attached chemical group called a ligand — a group or molecule that binds to a macromolecule such as a protein. When a protein mixture is added to the column, any protein with affinity for this ligand binds to the beads, and its migration through the matrix is retarded. For example, if the biological function of a protein involves binding to ATP, then attaching a molecule that resembles ATP to the beads in the column creates an affinity matrix that can help purify the protein. Proteins that do not bind to ATP flow more rapidly through the column. Bound proteins are then eluted by a solution containing either a high concentration of salt or a free ligand — in this case, ATP or an analog of ATP. Salt weakens the binding of the protein to the immobilized ligand, interfering with ionic interactions. Free ligand competes with the ligand attached to the beads, releasing the protein from the matrix; the protein product that elutes from the column is often bound to the ligand used to elute it.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZPTDipObqj">Protein purification protocols often use genetic engineering to fuse additional amino acids or peptides (tags) to the target protein. Affinity chromatography can be used to bind this tag, achieving a large increase in purity in a single step (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_723Y1AzTYo" id="dav_9781319322342_TgZOLndPvd">Fig. 9-11</a>). In many cases, the tag can be subsequently removed, fully restoring the function of the native protein.</p>

HPLC makes use of high-pressure pumps that speed the movement of the protein molecules down the column; it also uses higher-quality chromatographic materials that can withstand the crushing force of the pressurized flow. By reducing the transit time on the column, HPLC can limit diffusional spreading of protein bands and thus can greatly improve resolution.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_kIa4qLw00a">Choosing the approach to purification of a protein that has not previously been isolated is guided both by established precedents and by common sense. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Cz6LqB6c8X" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01c.png"/> In most cases, several different methods must be used sequentially to purify a protein completely, each separating proteins on the basis of different properties. The choice of methods is somewhat empirical, and many strategies may be tried before the most effective one is found. Researchers can often minimize trial and error by basing the new procedure on purification techniques developed for similar proteins. Common sense dictates that inexpensive procedures such as salting out be used first, when the total volume and the number of contaminants are greatest. As each purification step is completed, the sample size generally becomes smaller (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_C19eKKmc2o"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_3xDjlS8vTg" id="dav_9781319322342_zJ7vzee0Mw">Table 3-5</a></strong>), making it feasible to use more sophisticated (and expensive) chromatographic procedures at later stages.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Fu0tnRtVIV">A protein will bind about 1.4 times its weight of SDS, nearly one molecule of SDS for each amino acid residue. The sulfate moieties of the bound SDS contribute a large net negative charge, rendering the intrinsic charge of the protein insignificant and conferring on each protein a similar charge-to-mass ratio. In addition, SDS binding partially unfolds proteins, such that most SDS-bound proteins assume a similar rodlike shape. Electrophoresis in the presence of SDS therefore separates proteins almost exclusively on the basis of mass (molecular weight), with smaller polypeptides migrating more rapidly. After electrophoresis, the proteins are visualized by adding a dye such as Coomassie blue, which binds to proteins but not to the gel itself (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_lOiBM4Q2Y7" id="dav_9781319322342_X4x9dKKF4e">Fig. 3-18b</a>). Thus, a researcher can monitor the progress of a protein purification procedure as the number of protein bands visible on the gel decreases after each new fractionation step.

Activity and total protein generally decrease with each step. Activity decreases because there is always some loss due to inactivation or nonideal interactions with chromatographic materials or other molecules in the solution. Total protein decreases because the objective is to remove as much unwanted or nonspecific protein as possible. In a successful step, the loss of nonspecific protein is much greater than the loss of activity; therefore, specific activity increases even as total activity falls. The data are assembled in a purification table similar to <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_3xDjlS8vTg" id="dav_9781319322342_PYKWWF6dXQ">Table 3-5</a>.

Transport proteins can be assayed by their binding to the molecule they transport, and hormones and toxins by the biological effect they produce; for example, growth hormones will stimulate the growth of certain cultured cells. Some structural proteins represent such a large fraction of a tissue mass that they can be readily extracted and purified without a functional assay.
