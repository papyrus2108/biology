<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_73q2q48Adx">The central architectural feature of biological membranes is a double layer of lipids, which acts as a barrier to the passage of polar molecules and ions. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_9nQcMol9V9" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01b.png"/> Membrane lipids are amphipathic: one end of the molecule is hydrophobic, the other hydrophilic. The association of their hydrophobic regions with each other and their hydrophilic interactions with water direct their packing into sheets called membrane bilayers.

Sterols have a core composed of four fused carbocylic rings called the steroid nucleus. In triacylglycerols, glycerophospholipids, galactolipids, and sulfolipids, the alkyl groups are fatty acids in ester linkage. Sphingolipids contain a single fatty acid, in amide linkage to the sphingosine backbone. The membrane lipids of archaea are variable; that shown here has two very long, branched alkyl chains, each end in ether linkage with a glycerol moiety. Sterols have many different types of alkyl chains that can be attached to the steroid D ring at C-17. In phospholipids, the polar head group is joined through a phosphodiester, whereas glycolipids have a direct glycosidic linkage between the head-group sugar and the backbone glycerol. Many sterols contain a polar head group such as a carbonyl or hydroxyl group attached at C-3 of the steroid A ring.</p>

Galactolipids are localized in the thylakoid membranes (internal membranes) of chloroplasts; they make up 70% to 80% of the total membrane lipids of a vascular plant, and are therefore probably the most abundant membrane lipids in the biosphere. Phosphate is often the limiting plant nutrient in soil, and perhaps the evolutionary pressure to conserve phosphate for more critical roles favored plants that made phosphate-free lipids. Plant membranes also contain sulfolipids, in which a sulfonated glucose residue is joined to a diacylglycerol in glycosidic linkage. The sulfonate group bears a negative charge like that of the phosphate group in phospholipids.</p>

The kinds and amounts of gangliosides in the plasma membrane change dramatically during embryonic development. Tumor formation induces the synthesis of a new complement of gangliosides, and very low concentrations of a specific ganglioside have been found to induce differentiation of cultured neuronal tumor cells. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a serious autoimmune disorder in which the body makes antibodies against its own gangliosides, including those in neurons. The resulting inflammation damages the peripheral nervous system, leading to temporary (or sometimes permanent) paralysis.

Tests on prospective parents can detect abnormal enzymes; then DNA testing can determine the exact nature of the defect and the risk it poses for offspring. Once a pregnancy occurs, fetal cells obtained by sampling a part of the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or the fluid surrounding the fetus (amniocentesis) can be tested in the same way.</p>

The most abundant are the glycerophospholipids, which contain fatty acids esterified to two of the hydroxyl groups of glycerol. The third hydroxyl of glycerol is esterified with the polar head group via a phosphodiester bond. Common glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine differ in the structure of their head group.</li>
