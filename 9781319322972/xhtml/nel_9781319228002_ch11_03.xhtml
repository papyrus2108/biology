<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_f7Gkv7Ikrv">One remarkable feature of all biological membranes is their plasticity — their ability to change shape without losing their integrity and becoming leaky. The bases for this property are the noncovalent interactions among lipids in the bilayer and the mobility allowed to individual lipids because they are not covalently anchored to one another. We turn now to the dynamics of membranes: the motions that occur and the transient structures that are allowed by these motions.</p>

Transbilayer — or “flip-flop” — movement requires that a polar or charged head group leave its aqueous environment and move into the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer, a process with a large, positive free-energy change. There are, however, situations in which such movement is essential. For example, in the ER, membrane glycerophospholipids are synthesized on the cytosolic face, whereas sphingolipids are synthesized or modified on the lumenal surface. To get from their site of synthesis to their eventual point of deposition, these lipids must undergo flip-flop diffusion.</p>

The “raft” and “sea” domains of the plasma membrane are not rigidly separated; membrane proteins can move into and out of lipid rafts in a fraction of a second. But in the shorter time scale (microseconds) more relevant to many membrane-mediated biochemical processes, many of these proteins reside primarily in a raft.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4Z8rXc9is8">The approximate fraction of the cell surface occupied by rafts can be as high as 50% in some cases; the rafts cover half of the ocean. Indirect measurements in cultured fibroblasts suggest a diameter of roughly 50 nm for an individual raft, which corresponds to a patch containing a few thousand sphingolipids and perhaps 10 to 50 membrane proteins. Because most cells express more than 50 different kinds of plasma membrane proteins, it is likely that a single raft contains only a subset of membrane proteins and that this segregation of membrane proteins is functionally significant. Their presence in a single raft would hugely increase the likelihood of their collision. Certain membrane receptors and signaling proteins, for example, seem to be segregated together in membrane rafts. Experiments show that signaling through these proteins can be disrupted by manipulations that deplete the plasma membrane of cholesterol and destroy lipid rafts.</p>

Yeast cells provide another experimentally accessible system in which vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their secretion products. Both processes involve a family of proteins called SNAREs (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_BWwTNrHLh3">sna</i>p <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_QSBzgvm1U3">re</i>ceptors; <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_jfH5xlFjxN"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_EcCjjPgj6I" id="dav_9781319322342_GI4umZV19m">Fig. 11-26</a></strong>).

During fusion, a v-SNARE and a t-SNARE bind to each other and undergo a structural change that produces a bundle of long, thin rods made up of helices from both SNAREs and two helices from the protein SNAP25 (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_EcCjjPgj6I" id="dav_9781319322342_nLtFrFv86N">Fig. 11-26</a>). The two SNAREs initially interact at their ends, then zip up into the bundle of helices. This structural change pulls the two membranes into contact and initiates the fusion of their lipid bilayers. An alternative designation of SNARE types is based on structural features of the proteins: R-SNAREs have an Arg residue critical to their function, and Q-SNAREs have a critical Gln residue. Typically, R-SNAREs act as v-SNAREs, and Q-SNAREs act as t-SNAREs.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_gHPzVtuSxA">A secretory vesicle is shown in the cytosol above a plasma membrane. The vesicle contains many small, circular neurotransmitter molecules. A small red oval runs across the vesicle membrane at the lower left and is joined with a red thread that runs down and then bends to the left. A similar small red oval runs across the vesicle at the lower right and is joined with a thread that runs down and then bends to the right, where it is labeled v-S N A R E. The plasma membrane has a small red oval crossing its membrane on the left that joins to a blue thread above that curves smoothly up and to the left. A similar small red oval crosses the membrane to the right and joins to a blue thread above that curves smoothly up and to the right, where it is labeled t-S N A R E. To the right of the left-hand blue thread, there is a purple horizontal thread just below the top of the plasma membrane, in the yellow region. It has purple strands extending up from its left and right that smoothly curve up and to the left. A similar purple structure is embedded in the membrane just to the left of the right-hand blue thread with its strands extending up and to the right. This purple structure is labeled S N A P 25. Accompanying text reads, neurotransmitter-filled vesicle approaches the plasma membrane. An arrow points down to show the vesicle closer to the plasma membrane. The red, purple, and blue threads on the left run horizontally to the left and then intertwine. The red, purple, and blue threads on the right run horizontally to the right and then intertwine. Accompanying text reads, v-S N A R E and t-S N A R E bind to each other, zipping up from the amino termini and drawing the two membranes together. An arrow points down to show the vesicle in contact with the membrane and with the threads on each side fully intertwined. A small vertical space is visible between the bottom layer of phosphate heads of the vesicle membrane and the top layer of phosphate heads of plasma membrane where the bottom center of the vesicle and top center of the plasma membrane meet. Accompanying text reads, zipping causes curvature and lateral tension on bilayers, favoring hemifusion between outer leaflets. An arrow points down to show the vesicle membrane fused with the plasma membrane. The yellow lipid layer is continuous between the two and no blue phosphate layers separate them. Accompanying text reads, hemifusion: outer leaflets of both membranes come into contact. An arrow points down to show that there is now an opening between the space in the vesicle and the region beneath the membrane. A single membrane comes in from the lower left, bends upward where there is a red oval with intertwined strands to its left, forms a rounded region above, then bends more sharply downward at the bottom right of the rounded region where there is a red oval with intertwined strands to its right, before leaving to the lower right. Spheres representing neurotransmitter molecules are shown moving through the opening to leave the rounded region. Accompanying text reads, complete fusion creates a fusion pore. An arrow points down to show that the sides of the circle have moved to the left and right. There is now a membrane that runs horizontally, then bends upward where there is a red oval with intertwined threads that extend to the upper left, then runs horizontally, then bends downward, reaches another red oval with intertwined threads that extend to the upper right, then runs horizontally to the right. Neurotransmitters are shown throughout the open region. Accompanying text reads, pore widens; vesicle contents are released outside cell.</p>
