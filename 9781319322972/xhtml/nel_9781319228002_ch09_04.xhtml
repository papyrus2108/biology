<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_goORH1tKoY">Since the report of the first complete human genomes in 2001, human genome sequencing has become routine. The genomes of tens of thousands of other species have now been sequenced and made publicly available, providing a look at genomic complexity throughout the three domains of living organisms: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Whereas many early sequencing projects focused on species commonly used in research laboratories, the projects now include species of practical, medical, agricultural, and evolutionary interest. Genomes from <span aria-label="327" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page327" role="doc-pagebreak"/>every known bacterial family have been sequenced. Completed eukaryotic genome sequences number in the tens of thousands. Genomes of extinct species such as <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ARJ21aIbQI">Homo neanderthalensis</i> and of humans who died in past millennia have also been sequenced. Personal genomes are playing an ever-increasing role in medicine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_u1AUUjctSe">Each genome sequence becomes an international resource for researchers. Collectively, the sequences provide a source for broad comparisons that help pinpoint both variable and highly conserved gene segments, and they allow the identification of genes that are unique to a species or group of species. Efforts to map genes, identify new proteins and disease-related genes, elucidate genetic patterns of medical interest, and trace our evolutionary history are among the many initiatives under way.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_pAsKiSxaee">The rapidly growing genome databases have the potential not only to fuel advances in all realms of biochemistry but also to change the way we think about ourselves. What does our own genome, and comparisons with those of other organisms, tell us?</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_MvZ4Q8iwRd">In some ways, we are not as complicated as we once imagined. Humans have only about 20,000 protein-coding genes — less than twice the number in a fruit fly (13,600 genes), not many more than in a nematode worm (19,700 genes), and fewer than in a rice plant (38,000 genes).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qwhp8Uz6P9">In other ways, we are more complex than we previously realized. Many, if not most, eukaryotic genes contain one or more segments of DNA that do not code for the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide product. These nontranslated segments interrupt the otherwise colinear relationship between the gene’s nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide. Such nontranslated DNA segments are called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_z4Pnwq38Wl">introns</strong>, and the coding segments are called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_jSB7PKwO6k">exons</strong> (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_6rbT7sSDbX"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_80wy2Swwt7" id="dav_9781319322342_S1VEeifc80">Fig. 9-24</a></strong>). Few bacterial genes contain introns. The introns are spliced from a precursor RNA transcript to generate a transcript that can be translated contiguously into a protein product (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_EJ96u8vK9Y">Chapter 26</a>). An exon often (but not always) encodes a single domain of a larger, multidomain protein. Humans share many protein domain types with plants, worms, and flies, but the domains in the human genome are mixed and matched in more complex ways, increasing the variety of proteins found in our proteome. Alternative modes of gene expression and RNA splicing permit alternative combinations of exons, leading to the production of more than one protein from a single gene. Alternative splicing (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_Xkz4DHtwPD">Chapter 26</a>) is far more common in humans and other vertebrates than in worms or bacteria, allowing greater complexity in the number and kinds of proteins generated.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_oeVWXD38da">The relative paucity of protein-coding genes in the human genome leaves a lot of DNA unaccounted for. Much of the DNA that does not encode proteins (exons or introns) is in the form of repeated sequences of several kinds. Perhaps most surprising is that about half the human genome is made up of moderately repeated sequences that are derived from <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_HeSBlPQAZE">transposons</strong>, segments of DNA, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand base pairs long, that can move from one location to another in the genome. Originally discovered in corn by Barbara McClintock, who called them transposable elements, transposons are a kind of molecular parasite. They make their home in the genomes of essentially every organism. Many transposons contain genes encoding the proteins that catalyze the transposition process itself, as described in more detail in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_y7NWOgL66a">Chapters 25</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_5wIsRVvIXN">26</a>. There are several classes of transposons in the human genome. Many are strictly DNA segments, which have slowly increased in number over the millennia as a result of replication events coupled to the transposition process. Some, called retrotransposons, are closely related to retroviruses, transposing from one genomic location to another through RNA intermediates that are reconverted to DNA by reverse transcription. Some transposons in the human genome are active elements, moving at a low frequency, but most are inactive, evolutionary relics altered by mutations. Transposon movement can lead to the redistribution of other genomic sequences, and this has played a major role in human evolution.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4hIIyXVTBF">Once the protein-coding genes (including exons and introns) and transposons are accounted for, perhaps 25% of the total DNA remains. As a follow-up to the Human Genome Project, the ENCODE initiative was launched by the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2003 to identify functional elements in the human genome. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Od7HQR0yHh" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> The work of the worldwide consortium of research groups engaged in the ENCODE initiative has revealed that the vast majority (&gt;80%, including protein-coding genes, most transposons, and more) of the DNA in the human genome is either transcribed into RNA in at least one type of cell or tissue or is involved in some functional aspect of chromatin structure. Much of the noncoding (nontranscribed) DNA in the remaining 20% contains regulatory elements that affect the expression of the 20,000 protein-coding genes and the many additional genes encoding functional RNAs. Many mutations (SNPs; described below) associated with human genetic diseases lie in this noncoding DNA, probably affecting regulation of one or more genes. As described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_rwCDFL6Zj0">Chapters 26</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_THcL9RZFYr">27</a>, new classes of functional RNAs are being discovered at a rapid pace. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Vr40VrZAcA" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> Many of these functional RNAs, now being identified by a variety of screening methods, are produced by RNA-coding genes whose existence was previously unsuspected.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_uwBgW7fEDm">About 3% or so of the human genome consists of highly repetitive sequences referred to as <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_qwablHBV7z">simple-sequence repeats (SSRs)</strong>. Generally less than 10 bp long, an SSR is sometimes repeated millions of times per cell, distributed in short segments of tandem repeats. The most prominent examples of SSR DNA are found in centromeres and telomeres (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_NiXMIb5pnu" id="dav_9781319322342_sV9PWz2bhN">Chapter 24</a>). Human telomeres, for example, consist of up to 2,000 contiguous repeats of the sequence GGTTAG. Additional, shorter repeats of simple sequences also occur throughout the genome. These isolated segments of repeated sequences, often containing up to a few dozen tandem repeats of a simple sequence, are called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_m5mj5WFvpB">short tandem repeats (STRs)</strong>. Such sequences are the targets of the technologies used in forensic DNA analysis (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RvTz35XKvO" id="dav_9781319322342_cUCbBZRsfN">Box 8-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qD3dI8WlUW">What does all this information tell us about the similarities and differences among individual humans?

Each person differs from the next by, on average, 1 in every 1,000 bp. Many of these variations are in the form of SNPs, but the human population also has a wide range of larger deletions, insertions, and small rearrangements. From these often subtle genetic differences comes the human variety we are all aware of — such as differences in hair color, stature, foot size, eyesight, allergies to medication, and (to some unknown degree) behavior.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AUb2w8xMbh">The process of genetic recombination during meiosis tends to mix and match these small genetic variations so that different combinations of genes are inherited (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_P0nQLl7xPa">Chapter 25</a>). However, groups of SNPs and other genetic differences that are close together on a chromosome are rarely affected by recombination and are usually inherited together; such a grouping of multiple SNPs is known as a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_OY6Xe5Is2R"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_CvlrId7Xo8" id="dav_9781319322342_RzQIYh4E9p" role="doc-glossref">haplotype</a></dfn>. Haplotypes provide convenient markers for certain human populations and for individuals within populations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_aHW7hRmfSb">Defining a haplotype requires several steps. First, positions that contain SNPs in the human population are identified in genomic DNA samples from multiple individuals (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_LEtAibnOn0"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_tPQIZ5XDH1" id="dav_9781319322342_0FjTZPJfr4">Fig. 9-26a</a></strong>). Each SNP in a prospective haplotype may be separated from the next SNP by several thousand base pairs and still be regarded as “nearby” in the context of chromosomes that extend for millions of base pairs. Second, a set of SNPs typically inherited together is chosen as a defined haplotype (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_tPQIZ5XDH1" id="dav_9781319322342_R2X0zHBzfW">Fig. 9-26b</a>); each haplotype consists of the particular bases found at the various SNP positions within the defined set. Finally, tag SNPs — a subset of SNPs that define an entire haplotype — are chosen to uniquely identify each haplotype (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_tPQIZ5XDH1" id="dav_9781319322342_i29qGMGPZn">Fig. 9-26c</a>). By sequencing just these tag positions in genomic samples from human populations, researchers can quickly identify which of the haplotypes are present in each individual. Especially stable haplotypes exist in the mitochondrial genome (which does not undergo meiotic recombination) and on the Y chromosome (only 3% <span aria-label="329" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page329" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of which is homologous to the X chromosome and thus subject to recombination). As we will see, haplotypes can be used as markers to trace human migrations.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Sy3OVvi41R">The human genome is very closely related to other mammalian genomes over large segments of every chromosome. However, for a genome measured in billions of base pairs, differences of just a few percent can add up to millions of genetic distinctions. Searching among these, and making use of comparative genomics techniques, researchers can begin to explore the molecular basis of definably human characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_JIhJ4SCoLg">The genome sequences of our closest biological relatives, the chimpanzee (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_1VgXJJA4wl">Pan troglodytes</i>) and bonobo (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_zuAc39yeWF">Pan paniscus</i>), offer some important clues, and we can use them to illustrate the comparative process. Human and chimpanzee shared a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Genomic differences between the species, including SNPs and larger genomic rearrangements such as inversions, deletions, and fusions, can be used to construct a phylogenetic tree (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_1IZk1USNfE"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qmor09uh16" id="dav_9781319322342_U0ATLxRGEM">Fig. 9-27a</a></strong>). Over the course of evolution, segments of chromosomes may become inverted as a result of a segmental duplication, transposition of one copy to another arm of the same chromosome, and recombination between them (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qmor09uh16" id="dav_9781319322342_uN8fROIEgu">Fig. 9-27b</a>); such inversions have occurred in the human lineage on chromosomes 1, 12, 15, 16, and 18. Two chromosomes found in other primate lineages have been fused to form human chromosome 2 (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qmor09uh16" id="dav_9781319322342_UY1FOSwwwo">Fig. 9-27c</a>). The human lineage thus has 23 chromosome pairs rather than the 24 pairs typical of simians. Once this fusion appeared in the line leading to humans, it would have represented a major barrier to interbreeding with other primates that lacked it.</p>

The right-hand vertical line is accompanied by 83: D arrow to N above 312: V arrow to M, then it meets a horizontal line at half of the total height of the left-hand vertical line.

Part b shows a horizontal chromosome with a large white arm on the left and a short blue arm on the right. There is an orange band near the middle of the white arm. An arrow pointing down is labeled duplication. This produces a similar molecule with two of the orange bands. An arrow points from the original one to the new one on the right. This makes the long arm slightly longer. An arrow pointing down is labeled transposition. This produces a similar molecule with an arrow from the previous location of the right-hand orange band, which is no longer visible on the white arm, to a new orange band in the blue arm, which is now longer. An arrow pointing down is labeled inversion. This produces a similar chromosome with the right side bent under, forming a curve on the right and positioning the blue arm beneath the white arm. The orange band on the blue arm is directly beneath the orange band on the white arm, and they are connected by an X. An arrow points down to a chromosome with two similar, equally sized left and right arms. The left arm has an orange band in the original location, but the arm is blue to its right. The right arm has a long white piece with an orange bar near its right side that has a small blue piece to its right at the end of the arm. Part c shows three horizontal chromosomes as extended oblongs with irregularly places bands of varying widths. The top chromosome is labeled human chromosome 2 and has two arms, with the right arm slightly shorter than the left arm. Beneath it, there are two chimpanzee chromosomes. On the left, chimpanzee chromosome 2 p has a longer left side and shorter right side. It is lined up beneath the left side of human chromosome 2 and has a similar banding pattern. Chimpanzee chromosome 2 q is lower and lined up beneath the right side of human chromosome 2. It has a longer right arm and shorter left arm. Its banding pattern is similar to the banding pattern on the right side of human chromosome 2.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_CrvpVrB8Zg">If we look only at base-pair changes, the published human and chimpanzee genomes differ by only 1.23% (compared with the 0.1% variance from one human to another). Some variations are at positions where there is a known polymorphism in either the human population or the chimpanzee population, and these are unlikely to reflect a species-defining evolutionary change. When we ignore these positions, the differences amount to about 1.06%, or about 1 in 100 bp. This small fraction translates into more than 30 million base-pair differences, some of which affect protein function and gene regulation. Humans are approximately as closely related to bonobos as to chimpanzees.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_FRgEK3Vkb7">The genomic rearrangements that help distinguish chimpanzee and human include 5 million short insertions or deletions involving a few base pairs each, as well as a substantial number of larger insertions, deletions, inversions, and duplications that can involve many thousands of base pairs. When transposon insertions — a major source of genomic variation — are added to the list, the differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes increase. The chimpanzee genome has two classes of retrotransposons that are not present in the human genome (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_x5j27dPHsU">Chapter 26</a>). Other types of rearrangements, especially segmental duplications, are also common in primate <span aria-label="330" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" role="doc-pagebreak"/>lineages. Duplications of chromosomal segments can lead to changes in the expression of genes contained in these segments. There are about 90 million bp of such differences between human and chimpanzee, representing another 3% of these genomes. Each species has segments of DNA, constituting 40 million to 45 million bp, that are entirely unique to that particular genome, with larger chromosomal insertions, duplications, and other rearrangements affecting more base pairs than do single-nucleotide changes. Thus, in all, chimpanzee and human differ over about 4% of their genomes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_HH7mhB0iZQ">Sorting out which genomic distinctions are relevant to features that are uniquely human is a daunting task. If one assumes a similar rate of evolution in the chimpanzee and human lines after they diverged from their common ancestor, half the changes represent chimpanzee lineage changes and half represent human lineage changes. By comparing both genome sequences with those of more distantly related species referred to as <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_SPfxa2oYhi">outgroups</strong>, we can determine which variant was present in the common ancestor. Consider a locus, X, where there is a difference between the human and chimpanzee genomes (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_3wHUt6H3Rh"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_pqZJrKzNsL" id="dav_9781319322342_cugE8yjtWI">Fig. 9-28a</a></strong>). The lineage of the orangutan, an outgroup, diverged from that of chimpanzee and human prior to the common ancestor of chimpanzee and human (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_pqZJrKzNsL" id="dav_9781319322342_CcUVPhqlsF">Fig. 9-28b</a>). If the sequence at locus X is identical in orangutan and chimpanzee, this sequence was probably present in the chimpanzee and human ancestor, and the sequence seen in humans is specific to the human lineage. Sequences that are identical in human and orangutan can be eliminated as candidates for human-specific genomic features. The importance of comparisons with closely related <span aria-label="331" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page331" role="doc-pagebreak"/>outgroups has given rise to new efforts to sequence the genomes of orangutan, macaque, and many other primate species. Comparison of the human and bonobo genomes is refining the analysis of genes and alleles of special significance to humans.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_yfCLpmXUgg">The search for the genetic underpinnings of special human characteristics, such as our enhanced brain function, can benefit from two complementary approaches. The first approach searches for genomic regions where extreme changes have occurred, such as genes that have been duplicated many times or large genomic segments not present in other primates. The second approach looks at genes known to be involved in relevant human disease conditions. For brain function, for example, one would examine genes that, when mutated, contribute to cognitive or mental disorders.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_kxnpwFrUeK">Notably, analyses of the human lineage have not detected an increased rate of genetic change in protein-coding genes involved in brain development or size. In primates, most genes that function uniquely in the brain are even more highly conserved than genes functioning in other tissues, perhaps due to some special constraints related to brain biochemistry. However, there are some differences in gene expression patterns between humans and other primates that may affect brain function. For example, the gene encoding the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which plays an important role in neurotransmitter synthesis, has been subjected to gene duplication events, so that there are now multiple copies of it. Genomic regions related to gene regulation have disproportionately high numbers of changes in genes involved in neural development and nutrition. Our brains have become larger as a result, and additional functional effects may eventually be defined. A variety of RNA-coding genes, some with expression concentrated in the brain, also show evidence of accelerated evolution (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Aw4uX9HudE"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_9fgfwCKIoP" id="dav_9781319322342_7AXstOANMp">Fig. 9-29</a></strong>). Many of these are probably involved in regulating the expression of other genes. As we continue to discover many new classes of RNA (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_o9LepgMPRy">Chapter 26</a>), we are likely to radically change our perspective on how evolution alters the workings of living systems.</p>

That promise has been fulfilled: <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_kijBPiOrlO" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> more than 6,000 human mutation phenotypes, mostly associated with genetic diseases, have been mapped to particular genes or groups of genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_TrnLxtfIgw">For the last two decades, the main approach to gene mapping has been <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_aYEyGfNqKs">linkage analysis</strong>, yet another approach derived from evolutionary biology. In brief, the gene involved in a disease condition is mapped relative to well-characterized genetic polymorphisms that occur throughout the human genome. We can illustrate this approach by describing the search for one gene involved in early-onset Alzheimer disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Hsm4bGaHrK">About 10% of all cases of Alzheimer disease in the United States result from an inherited predisposition. Several different genes have been discovered that, when mutated, can lead to early onset of the disease. One such gene, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_k2UPMvw8TO">PS1</i>, encodes the protein presenilin-1, and its discovery made heavy use of linkage analysis. The search begins with large families having multiple individuals affected by a particular disease — in this case, Alzheimer disease. Two of the many family pedigrees used to search for this gene in the early 1990s are shown in <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_A2MYNVdlu9"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_2pNRfVm1Il" id="dav_9781319322342_4YgsH0FSar">Figure 9-30a</a></strong>. In studies of this type, DNA samples are collected from both affected and unaffected family members. Researchers first localize the region associated <span aria-label="332" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page332" role="doc-pagebreak"/>with a disease to a specific chromosome by comparing the genotypes of individuals with and without the disease, focusing especially on close family members. The specific points of comparison are sets of well-characterized SNP loci mapped to each chromosome, as identified by the Human Genome Project. By identifying the SNPs that are most often inherited with the disease-causing gene, investigators can gradually localize the responsible gene to a single chromosome.

The key shows that a shaded diamond represents an effected individual, a diagonal slash means death either before or soon after the study, 30 to 84 equals the age at the time of the study, and D 51 to D 66 equals the age at death. The top pedigree is labeled uppercase L family. At the top, a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 41 is connected by a horizontal line to an open diamond with a slash. A vertical line extends down to a long horizontal line from which vertical lines extend down to the offspring. The first offspring is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 48 that is connected to an open diamond with a slash labeled 77 from which a vertical line leads down to a long horizontal line of offspring. Offspring 1: a shaded diamond labeled 43 connected to an open diamond with a slash that produced an offspring shown as a shaded diamond labeled 45; offspring 2: an open diamond labeled 63; offspring 3: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 30 connected to an open diamond with a slash that produced an offspring shown as a shaded diamond labeled 47; offspring 4: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 45; offspring 5: an open diamond with a slash labeled 58; offspring 6: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 41; offspring 7: an open diamond with a slash labeled 56; offspring 8: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 39; offspring 9: an open diamond labeled 53; offspring 10: an open diamond labeled 49; offspring 11: an open diamond labeled 41; offspring 12: a shaded diamond labeled 44; offspring 12: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 39. Going back to the offspring of the original parents, the second offspring is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 36 and the third offspring is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 48 that is connected to an open diamond with a slash that produce four offspring: a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 39, a shaded diamond labeled 40, a shaded diamond labeled 41, and an open diamond labeled 41. The final two offspring of the original parents are an open diamond labeled 84 and an open diamond labeled 78. The second pedigree is labeled S N W family. It begins with a shaded square with a slash at the top connected to an open square with a slash. These produce five offspring. The first offspring is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 61 connected with an open diamond with a slash that produce an offspring that is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 66. D 66 pairs with an open diamond to produce five offspring: an open diamond labeled 73, a shaded diamond labeled 50, an open diamond labeled 76, a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 56, and an open diamond labeled 72. The second offspring of the original parents is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 61 that is connected to an open diamond with a slash. These produce three offspring. The first, a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 64, pairs with an open diamond to produce a shaded diamond. The second two are both shaded diamonds with slashes labeled D 60 and D 52, respectively. The third offspring of the original parents is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 57 that pairs with an open diamond with a slash to produce two offspring, an open diamond labeled 80 and a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 54. The fourth offspring of the original parents is a shaded diamond with a slash labeled D 59 that connects with an open diamond with a slash to produce five offspring. These are a red diamond with a slash labeled 48; a red diamond with a slash labeled D 53 that connects with an open diamond to produce a red diamond with a slash labeled 50 and an open diamond with a slash labeled 50; a red diamond with a slash labeled D 51; a red diamond with a slash labeled 53; and an open diamond labeled 67. The fifth offspring of the original parents is an open diamond with a slash labeled D 50 that connects with another open diamond with a slash to produce a shaded diamond with a slash labeled 56. Part b shows a vertical chromosome on the left with a vertical line to the right. The vertical chromosome has a short arm on top and a longer arm below. It has tan and white bands of different widths along it. From top to bottom, the chromosome is labeled as follows. Short arm: 12, 12, 11.2. 11.1 is shown at and below the centromere. The long arm has 11.2, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 24.1,24.2, 24.3, 31, 32.1, 32.2, and 32.3. The line running alongside at the right begins with D14 S50 at the top next to a horizontal line. To the left of this, (T C R D) is shown with a line pointing down to a bracket that encloses a white region just below the centromere labeled 11.1 at the top and 11.2 near the bottom. The vertical line on the right has 16.1 in the space between D 14 S 50 and the next horizontal line at D 14 S 54, then 7.6 in the space before a horizontal line at D14 D 49, then 11.7 in the space before the horizontal line at D14 S 47, then 12.6 in the space before the horizontal line at D14 S 52. This is near the middle of the chromosome. Next, there is 20.7 in the space before the horizontal line for D14 S 43, which has 2.5 before the next horizontal line at D24 S 53. A line extends from 2.5 to a bracket enclosing a white band on the chromosome between about 24.3 and 24.3. Next, the space is labeled 9.2 and then the next line is D14 S 55, which is just above D14 S 48 with 1.6 between them. Next, there is a space labeled 13.5 and then a horizontal line labeled italicized P I end italics (A A C T), from which a line extends to a bracket around a white line at about 32.1 on the chromosome. Next, 5.6 is shown in the space before the bottom horizontal line, labeled D14 S 51. Just beneath the bracket at 32.1, there is a very small bracket labeled D14 S 1 enclosing a tan band at 32.2 on the chromosome. Part c shows a horizontal double-headed arrow. The left end is labeled to telomere and has a vertical line labeled D14 S 53. From left to right, there are vertical lines labeled as follows: D14 S 61 is about one quarter of the distance across the line. The central region is labeled region of interest with a bracket that encloses five vertical lines. From left to right, these are D14 S76, S14 S43/71, D14 S77, D14 S277, and D14 S268. Below this bracket, there are 19 small green fragments of varying sizes and one longer orange bar labeled italicized S182 in italics. To the right of this region, there is a vertical line labeled D14 S289. Near the right end, there is a vertical bar labeled D14 S258. The right-hand arrow is labeled, to centromere. The region of interest is about 1.5 M b in length and the entire fragment is about 5 M b in length. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_wE3zdzVRIB">Chromosomes are very large DNA molecules, and localizing the gene to one chromosome is only a small part of the battle. Localizing the gene to one chromosome (in this case, chromosome 14) is only the beginning of narrowing the search for a gene. Chromosomes are very large molecules; each one houses thousands of SNPs and other changes. Simply sequencing the entire chromosome would be unlikely to reveal the SNP or other change associated with the disease. Instead, investigators rely on statistical methods that correlate the inheritance of additional, more closely spaced polymorphisms with the occurrence of the disease, focusing on a denser panel of polymorphisms known to occur on the chromosome of interest. The more closely a marker is located to a disease gene, the more likely it is to be inherited along with that gene. This process can pinpoint a region of the chromosome that contains the <span aria-label="333" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" role="doc-pagebreak"/>gene. However, the region may still encompass many genes. In our example, linkage analysis indicated that the disease-causing gene, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_9obVXDlRe8">PS1</i>, was somewhere near the SNP locus D14S43 (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_2pNRfVm1Il" id="dav_9781319322342_OD4WHSpXFh">Fig. 9-30c</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_yn26iytTG7">The final steps in identifying the gene use the human genome databases. The local region containing the gene is examined, and the genes within it are identified. DNA from many individuals, some who have the disease and some who do not, is sequenced over this region. As the DNA in this region is sequenced from increasing numbers of individuals, gene variants that are consistently present in individuals with the disease and absent in unaffected individuals can be identified. An understanding of the function of the genes in the target region can aid the search, because particular metabolic pathways may be more likely than others to produce the disease state. In 1995, the chromosome 14 gene associated with Alzheimer disease was identified as <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_W58gZmh3eq">S182</i>. The product of this gene was given the name presenilin-1, and the gene was subsequently renamed <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_h7Rq4s9HrU">PS1</i>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_JyM0ClVEdY">Many human genetic diseases are caused by mutations in a single gene or in sequences involved in regulation of that gene. Several different mutations in a particular gene, all leading to the same or related genetic condition, may be present in the human population. For example, there are several variants of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_J2LGLj4nxV">PS1</i>, all giving rise to a much-increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. Another, more extreme example is the several genes encoding different hemoglobins: more than 1,000 known mutational variants are present in the human population. Some of these variants are innocuous; some cause diseases ranging from sickle cell disease to thalassaemias. The inheritance of particular mutant genes may be concentrated in families or in isolated populations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_aWjOA06cBq">More complex are cases in which a disease condition is caused by mutations in two different genes (neither of which, alone, causes the disease), or in which a particular condition is enhanced by an otherwise innocuous mutation in another gene. Identifying the genes and mutations responsible for these digenic diseases is exceedingly difficult, and sometimes such diseases can be documented only within small, isolated, and highly inbred populations.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Ym1lYYTHde">Genome databases provide alternative paths to the identification of disease genes. In many cases, we already have biochemical information about the disease. In the case of early-onset Alzheimer disease, an accumulation of the amyloid-<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_0dpPhPWKfk">β</i> protein in limbic and association cortices of the brain is at least partly responsible for the symptoms. Defects in presenilin-1 (and in a related protein, presenilin-2, encoded by a gene on chromosome 1) lead to the elevated cortical levels of amyloid-<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_XmK6knOx0b">β</i> protein. Focused databases are being developed that catalog such functional information on the protein products of genes and on protein-interaction networks and SNP locations, along with other data. The result is a streamlined path to the identification of candidate genes for a particular disease. If a researcher knows a little about the kinds of enzymes or other proteins likely to contribute to disease symptoms, these databases can quickly generate a list of genes known to encode proteins with relevant functions, a list of additional uncharacterized genes with orthologous or paralogous relationships to these genes, a list of proteins known to interact with the target proteins or orthologs in other organisms, and a map of gene positions. Often, with the aid of data from some selected family pedigrees, a short list of potentially relevant genes can be rapidly determined.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_OjDnzXA0im">These approaches are not limited to human diseases. The same methods can be used to identify the genes involved in diseases — or genes that produce desirable characteristics — in other animals and in plants. Of course, they can also be used to track down genes involved in any observable trait that a researcher might be interested in. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_0WJSux647l" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_QkZe7smlUX">Anatomically modern humans arose in Africa between 250,000 and 350,000 years ago. About 100,000 to 120,000 years ago, humans in Africa looked out across the Red Sea to Asia. Perhaps encouraged by some innovation in small boat construction, or driven by conflict or famine, or simply curious, they crossed the water barrier. That initial colonization began a journey that did not stop until humans reached Tierra del Fuego (at the southern tip of South America), many thousands of years later. As <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_lFZHbEfHtN">Homo sapiens</i> populations moved into more northern parts of Europe and Asia about 45,000 years ago, established populations from previous hominid expansions into Eurasia, including <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_X3ON6ItEw1">Homo neanderthalensis</i> and a group now called the Denisovans, were displaced. The Neanderthals and Denisovans disappeared, just as other hominid lines had disappeared before them.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AkSOU0vC47">The story of how modern humans first appeared in Africa a few hundred thousand years ago, and their migrations as they eventually radiated out of Africa, is written in our DNA. Genomic sequences from multiple species have brought both primate and hominid evolution into sharper focus. Using haplotypes present in extant human populations, we can trace the migrations of our intrepid ancestors across the planet (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_vohs8J7UQP"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ujuG8Nzo67" id="dav_9781319322342_V4yZYm5MIY">Fig. 9-31a</a></strong>).

We know that up to 5% of the genome of most <span aria-label="334" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page334" role="doc-pagebreak"/>non-African humans is derived from Neanderthals. Anatomically modern human remains up to 45,000 years old have been sequenced, beginning an effort to pinpoint the period of interbreeding. Human populations native to Melanesia and Australia acquired up to 6% of their genomic DNA from the Denisovans. Neanderthal DNA gave humans a more complex immune system, making us more resistant to infection but also a little more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. The story of our past is gradually taking shape as more genomes, of humans alive today and those who lived in past millennia, are being assembled.</p>

All locations are described using modern geography. The lines are color-coded to indicate approximate appearance of marker in k y a. The key indicates that bright brown is 60, brown is 50, olive green is 45, dark green is 40, bright green is 35, blue is 30, dark purple is 25, light purple is 20, and reddish purple is 10. A short bright brown line labeled M 91 extends down from the origin. A brown line labeled M 60 extends west from the origin across Africa. Another brown line labeled M 169 extends up from the origin and splits. The first branch travels east, with a small branch going upward almost immediately across Saudi Arabia and with a branch labeled M 130 curving down into Australia and another branch curving upward with a branch that crosses Japan into Russia and China and another that travels up through northeastern Russia, into Alaska, and down the northern part of the west coast of North America. Going back to the origin, the second branch from the same line runs just north of the first one. The line running north from the first one becomes olive green and is labeled M 89 after it passes this second line. The main line runs into the southern Pacific and then curves back into China as M 174. The olive green line runs north and branches east as a dark blue line labeled M 170 that runs across Turkey and into Europe. To the north of that branch, it branches west into northern Africa as a reddish purple line and into southern Europe and Italy as a reddish purple line. Going back to the origin, the line becomes olive green and is labeled M 96 after the first two lines split to the east. This line becomes light purple as it splits with one half, labeled M 2, pointing down into southeastern African and the other branch, labeled M 35, crossing the Red Sea, looping through southern Turkey, and ending in southern Greece. The olive green branch from the first brown line to branch from the line from the origin has a blue branch to the east in Saudi Arabia that splits into a light purple branch labeled M 201 pointing toward into and a blue branch that curves down into India. Just above this, a dark green line labeled M 9 moves east from Saudi Arabia into the region of Pakistan and India, then a blue branch labeled M 20 goes south into southern India, a bright green line goes north and has a reddish purple branch labeled M 45 and curves north and becomes L L Y 22 as it enters Finland, has a purple branch labeled M 242 that extends into Russia, crosses into Alaska, becomes reddish purple and is labeled M 3 as it travels through North America, and ends in the middle of South America, and has a blue branch labeled M 173 that becomes M 343 in Europe and runs all the way to Spain. It also has an olive green branch that runs through India into southeastern Asia, where a reddish purple line labeled M4 runs south into Indonesia and New Guinea and a bright green piece labeled M 175 bends toward China and becomes reddish purple M 122. Part b shows a phylogeny. There is a short horizontal line at the left that meets a long vertical line that has horizontal lines on each end. The top horizontal line runs to the right, where it is labeled unknown. The bottom vertical line has two branches. The top branch further branches into two boxes: Denisovans and Neanderthals. The bottom branch runs to a box labeled modern humans. A red arrow pointing down from the horizontal line labeled unknown to the branch to Denisovans is labeled 0.5 percent to 8 percent. The horizontal line to the Denisovans branches to a top horizontal line labeled B and a bottom horizontal line labeled Siberia. The line into the middle box, Neanderthals, branches into a top line labeled Siberia and a bottom line that further branches. There is a highlighted arrow labeled greater than 0.5 percent that points from the top line labeled Siberia in the Neanderthals box to the bottom lined labeled Siberia in the Denisovans box. Within the Neanderthals box, the top line labeled Siberia branches first, then the bottom line branches to a top line labeled Croatia and a bottom line that further branches to Caucasus on top and A on the bottom. The branch to the box labeled modern humans branches into a bottom line horizontal line labeled Africa and a top line that further branches. A red arrow pointing down from line A in the Neanderthals box to this branch point is labeled 1.5 percent to 2.1 percent. This labeled branch point produces a bottom line labeled Europe and a top line that further branches into a line labeled Oceania on top and a line labeled Asia below. A highlighted arrow labeled approximately 5 percent points down from line B in the Denisovans box to Oceania in the modern human box, and a dotted curved line points from it to the horizontal line leading to the branch between Oceania and Asia.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_qf77ZzHRNz">Modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in Europe and Asia as recently as 30,000 years ago. The human and Neanderthal ancestral populations diverged about 370,000 years ago, somewhat before the appearance of anatomically modern humans. Neanderthals used tools, lived in small groups, and buried their dead. Of the known hominid relatives of modern humans, Neanderthals are the closest. For hundreds of millennia, they inhabited large parts of Europe and western Asia (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_TCDmmkmKNI" id="dav_9781319322342_ReTfFn2yGo">Fig. 1</a>). If the chimpanzee genome can tell us something about what it is to be human, the Neanderthal genome can tell us more. Buried in the bones and other remains taken from burial sites are fragments of Neanderthal genomic DNA. Technologies developed for use in forensic science (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RvTz35XKvO" id="dav_9781319322342_0hNKjgvTtp">Box 8-1</a>) and studies of ancient DNA have been combined in the Neanderthal genome project.</p>

The shaded region includes southern England, the western half of mainland Europe extending down into the boot of Italy and up to where Germany meets Denmark. Around the modern northwestern border of Poland, the shaded region ends in a diagonal line that extends down to the west of the Black Sea and about halfway across the Caspian Sea, continuing to the east of the Caspian Sea and looping downward, intersecting the top of the Gulf of Oman through modern Iraq and ending at the Mediterranean Sea just before the Red Sea. Locations listed include Figueria Brava in modern Spain, with Le Moustier north of Moula Guercy in France and Saccopastore in Italy. Arcy-sur-Cure and La Chapelle-aux-Saints are to the north and east in France, above Krapina and Vindija. Neanderthal is at the northeastern boundary of the shaded region and Kulra, Sipka, and Molodovo are found along this boundary from northwest to southeast, with Erd to the west of Molodovo. Shanidar is between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Tabun is just to the east of the Red Sea in Isreal, just southwest of Amud.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_mgpaqteCW8">This endeavor is unlike the genome projects aimed at extant species. The Neanderthal DNA is present in small amounts, and it is contaminated with DNA from other animals and bacteria. How does one get at it, and how can one be certain that the sequences really came from Neanderthals? The answers have been revealed by innovative applications of biotechnology. In essence, the small quantities of DNA fragments found in Neanderthal bone or other remains are cloned into a library, and the cloned DNA segments are sequenced at random, contaminants and all. The sequencing results are compared with the existing human genome and chimpanzee genome databases. Segments derived from Neanderthal DNA have sequences closely related to human DNA and chimpanzee DNA and thus are readily distinguished by computerized analysis from segments derived from bacteria or insects. Once these segments are sequenced, they can be used as probes to identify sequence fragments in ancient samples that overlap with these known fragments. The potential problem of contamination with the closely related modern human DNA can be controlled for by examining mitochondrial DNA. Human populations have readily identifiable haplotypes (distinctive sets of genomic differences; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_tPQIZ5XDH1" id="dav_9781319322342_PH0PDcvRto">Fig. 9-26</a>) in their mitochondrial DNA, and analysis of Neanderthal samples has shown that Neanderthals’ mitochondrial DNA has its own distinct haplotypes. The presence in the Neanderthal samples of some base-pair differences that are found in the chimpanzee database but not in the human database is more evidence that nonhuman hominid sequences are being found.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_wWBLQcSUn4">Multiple high-quality Neanderthal genomic sequences have been completed. The data provide evidence that modern humans and the Neanderthals who were the source of this DNA shared a common ancestor about 700,000 years ago (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_v5bLHpqckv" id="dav_9781319322342_jwRvrb9leL">Fig. 2</a>). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggests that the two groups continued on the same track, with some gene flow between them, for about 300,000 more years. The lines split with the appearance of anatomically modern humans, although evidence now exists for some intermingling of the lines somewhat later as humans spread through Eurasia.</p>

The line is labeled, evolutionary lineage of ancestral human and Neanderthal populations. A vertical line leading into the bottom center of the shaded box is labeled, evolutionary lineage of ancestral human and Neanderthal reference sequences. A thick vertical line extends from this point to a point at about one-eighth of the height of the box, where diagonal lines extend to the left and right. A dotted horizontal line running across this point is accompanied by text reading, approximately 706 k y a; coalescence time of human and Neanderthal reference sequences. A second dotted horizontal line is located at about half the height of the shaded vertical box and is accompanied by text reading, approximately 370 k y a; split of ancestral human and Neanderthal populations. A bracket from the bottom dotted horizontal line to the dotted horizontal line at the midline is labeled, genomic data. The two lines continue upward. Another dotted horizontal line crosses them at about three-quarters of the height of the box and is accompanied by text reading, approximately 195 k y a; earliest known anatomically modern humans. Near the top of the box, the left line bends diagonally to the left and intersects a dotted horizontal line, then runs vertically upward to text reading, modern human. The right-hand line bends to the right at the same height and crosses the same horizontal dotted line, which is accompanied by text reading, approximately 41 k y a; earliest modern humans in Europe. A second horizontal dotted line almost immediately above this, where the left and right lines are both vertical again, is accompanied by text reading, approximately 8 k y a; most recent known Neanderthal remains. The right vertical line ends at this dotted line and is labeled Neanderthal. A bracket from this horizontal dotted line down to the horizontal dotted line at approximately 195 k y a and about three-quarters of the height of the shaded box is labeled, fossil data.
