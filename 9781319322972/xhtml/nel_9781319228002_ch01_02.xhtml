The smallest organisms consist of single cells and are microscopic. Larger, multicellular organisms contain many different types of cells, which vary in size, shape, and specialized function. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_4Bux1QFVu3" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> Despite these obvious differences, all cells of the simplest and most complex organisms share certain fundamental properties, which can be seen at the biochemical level.</p>

It is composed of lipid and protein molecules that form a thin, tough, pliable, hydrophobic barrier around the cell. The membrane is a barrier to the free passage of inorganic ions and most other charged or polar molecules. Transport proteins in the plasma membrane allow the passage of certain ions and molecules, receptor proteins transmit signals into the cell, and membrane enzymes participate in some reaction pathways. Because the individual lipids and proteins of the plasma membrane are not covalently linked, the entire structure is remarkably flexible, allowing changes in the shape and size of the cell. As a cell grows, newly made lipid and protein molecules are inserted into its plasma membrane; cell division produces two cells, each with its own membrane. This growth and cell division (fission) occurs without loss of membrane integrity.</p>

The plasma membrane forms the outer boundary of each cell. The ribosomes are free-floating dots in the bacterial cell and are attached to the top and bottom sides of a stack of five bars in the animal cell. The nucleoid region in the bacterial cell contains a circular, wavy strand. The nucleus of the animal cell is a large circle in its center surrounded by a nuclear membrane.

Short thread-like structures extending from all sides of the cell are labeled, pili; provide points of adhesion to surface of other cells. Many small dots found in a concentric ring around the central region are labeled, ribosomes; bacterial and archaeal ribosomes are smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes, but serve the same function – protein synthesis from an R N A message. Several long strands extending from the cell are labeled, flagella; propel cell through its surroundings. Part b at the top right shows a cross-section of the cell envelope of a Gram-positive bacterium. Across the bottom is a horizontal strip labeled, plasma membrane with cytoplasm beneath. Two triangular structures labeled, lipoproteins have their vertices in the membrane with two strands extending deep into the membrane. At the top of each lipoprotein, a strand extends to a horizontal chain of ovals connected by stands that run from left to right and are attached by jagged lines to a similar line above. There is a thick layer with many of these interconnected strands, and this entire region is labeled, peptidoglycan. Above them, irregular oblongs labeled, glycoproteins are spaced in a horizontal row labeled, solid layer. Each has two vertical chains of ovals connected by stands (similar to that of peptidoglycan) extending upward. These are labeled, glycoproteins. Two longer, different strands labeled, Polysaccharides have a similar structure of ovals connected by strands each run vertically through a space between two glycoproteins and extending into the peptidoglycan layer. Part c at the middle right is labeled, Gram-negative bacterium (shown in part a), which has a similar structure to the Gram-positive bacterium with the following differences. There are far fewer strands of peptidoglycan. There are layers of space labeled, periplasm above and below the peptidoglycan. Tubular structures labeled, membrane proteins are placed vertically in the plasma membrane. Above the peptidoglycan, the glycoproteins in part b are replaced by an outer membrane that runs horizontally across the top. An open channel structure across the outer membrane is labeled, porin, and there are many vertical strands extending from the outer membrane labeled, L P S.

Part d at the bottom right represents Methanothermus, an extremely heat-tolerant archaeon.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Q0u8dDEsi1">Other species of bacteria, as well as archaea, contain a similar collection of biomolecules, but each species has physical and metabolic specializations related to its environmental niche and nutritional sources. Cyanobacteria, for example, have internal membranes specialized to trap energy from light (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch20_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zVTVYg049w" id="dav_9781319322342_YI7x0vYmCR">Fig. 20-23</a>). Many archaea live in extreme environments and have biochemical adaptations to survive in extremes of temperature, pressure, or salt concentration. Differences in ribosomal structure gave the first hints that Bacteria and Archaea constituted separate domains. Most bacteria (including <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_CSyAVxRLKJ">E. coli</i>) exist as individual cells, but often associate in biofilms or mats, in which large numbers of cells adhere to each other and to some solid substrate beneath or at an aqueous surface. Cells of some bacterial species (the myxobacteria, for example) show simple social behavior, forming many-celled aggregates in response to signals between neighboring cells.</p>

In supramolecular complexes, however, macromolecules are held together largely by noncovalent interactions — much weaker, individually, than covalent bonds. Among these noncovalent interactions are hydrogen bonds; ionic interactions (between charged groups); and aggregations of nonpolar groups in aqueous solution, brought about by van der Waals interactions (also called London <span aria-label="9" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>forces) and by the hydrophobic effect — all of which have energies much smaller than those of covalent bonds. (These noncovalent interactions are described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch02_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_P2fbXR52dT" id="dav_9781319322342_rkM5wdoRHt">Chapter 2</a>.) The large numbers of weak interactions between macromolecules in supramolecular complexes stabilize these assemblies, producing their unique structures.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_t0ciSzX4Ys">One approach to understanding a biological process is to study purified molecules in vitro (from the Latin, meaning “in glass” — in the test tube), without interference from other molecules present in the intact cell — that is, in vivo (from the Latin, meaning “in the living”). Although this approach has been remarkably revealing, we must keep in mind that the inside of a cell is quite different from the inside of a test tube. The “interfering” components eliminated by purification may be critical to the biological function or regulation of the molecule that is being purified. For example, in vitro studies of pure enzymes are commonly done at very low enzyme concentrations in thoroughly stirred aqueous solutions. In the cell, an enzyme is dissolved or suspended in the gel-like cytosol with thousands of other proteins, some of which bind to that enzyme and influence its activity. Some enzymes are components of multienzyme complexes in which reactants are channeled from one enzyme to another, never entering the bulk solvent. When all of the known macromolecules in a cell are represented in their known dimensions and concentrations (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_il1ALrV5wU"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch01_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_K8x0UNXgY8" id="dav_9781319322342_IXYipwlFah">Fig. 1-10</a></strong>), it is clear that the cytosol is very crowded and that diffusion of macromolecules within the cytosol must be slowed by collisions with other large structures. In short, a given molecule may behave quite differently in the cell than it behaves in vitro. A central challenge of biochemistry is to understand the influences of cellular organization and macromolecular associations on the function of individual enzymes and other biomolecules — to understand function in vivo as well as in vitro.</p>

Further upward and to the right, a curved layer labeled, cell envelope contains several layers. The inner layer is a band labeled, inner membrane with many embedded rectangular proteins. A thin, unlabeled central layer consists of parallel white threads. The outer membrane resembles the inner membrane, except that vertical structures extend up above it. A thick tubular structure labeled, flagellum extends up from the membrane and out of the frame above.
