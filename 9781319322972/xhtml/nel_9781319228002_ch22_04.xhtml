The reaction begins with 8 delta-aminolevulinate, shown as a vertical five-carbon zigzag chain with nonhighlighted C 1 at the top forming C O O minus, C 4 double bonded to O to the left, and C 5 bonded to N H 2 below. Arrow 1 points right to 4 porphobilinogen and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of 8 H 2 O. Porphobilinogen is a five-membered ring with N substituted for C at its bottom vertex and bonded to H, double bonds at its upper left and right sides, a lower left vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to N H 2, an upper left vertex bonded to C O O minus, and an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 C H 2 C O O minus. The left side of the molecule is highlighted in red except for N H at the bottom vertex, N H 2 bonded to the chain extending from the lower left vertex, and C O O minus at the end of the chain extending from the upper left vertex. The top bond is not highlighted. The right side of the molecule is highlighted in blue. Arrow 2 points right to pre-uroporphyrinogen and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of 4 N H 4 plus. Pre-uroporphyrinogen contains four five-membered rings, one in each corner of a larger-scale structure that is roughly square with an open center. The rings are each slightly angled with the top vertex slightly toward the outside, but rings are described as though the top vertex pointed upward for clarity. Each ring has nonhighlighted N H at the vertex facing the center of the overall structure, and bonds projecting out to red highlighted A c and blue highlighted A c. Except for the upper and lower left rings, which are not connected, all of the other rings are joined by a nonhighlighted bond to C H 2 that has a blue highlighted bond to the next ring. The upper left five-membered ring has N substituted for C at its lower right vertex and bonded to H; its lower left vertex connected by a zigzag chain of a blue bond, a vertex, a blue bond, and then non-highlighted O H; a blue double bond at its lower left side; a blue bond from its left vertex to red highlighted A c, a nonhighlighted upper left side, a top vertex connected by a red bond to blue highlighted P r, a red double bond at the upper right side, a red bond at the lower right side, and the upper right vertex connected by a nonhighlighted bond to a vertex to the upper right from which a blue bond extends down to the upper left vertex of the right-hand five-membered ring. In addition to this bond from its upper left vertex, the right-hand five-membered ring has a blue double bond at its upper left side, a top vertex connected by a blue bond to red highlighted A c, a nonhighlighted upper right side, a right side vertex connected by a red bond to blue highlighted P r, a red double bond at its lower right side, nonhighlighted N substituted for C at the lower left vertex and further bonded to H, a nonhighlighted bond at its lower left side, and a lower right vertex connected by a nonhighlighted bond to a vertex to the lower right from which a blue bond extends to bond with the top vertex of the five-membered ring at the lower right. In addition to this bond from the top vertex, the five-membered ring at the lower right has a blue double bond at its upper right side, a right side vertex connected by a blue bond to red highlighted A c, a nonhighlighted lower right side, a bottom vertex connected by a red bond to blue highlighted P r, a red double bond at the bottom, a red lower left side, N substituted for C and further bonded to H at the upper left vertex, a nonhighlighted upper left side, and a lower left vertex connected to a nonhighlighted bond to a vertex at the lower left further connected by a blue bond to the lower right vertex of the five-membered ring in the lower left corner. In addition to this bond from the lower right vertex, the five-membered ring at the lower left corner has a nonhighlighted lower right bond, N substituted for C at the upper right vertex and further bonded to H, a red upper right side, a double bond at its upper left side, a left side vertex connected by a red bond to blue highlighted P r, a blue bond at the lower left side, a lower left vertex connected by a blue bond to red highlighted A c, and a blue double bond at the bottom side. An arrow labeled 3 points right to uroporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 accompanied by an arrow that branches off to show the loss of H 2 O. Uroporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 is similar to pre-uroporphyrinogen except that only the A c and P r groups are still highlighted and the lower left vertex of the upper left five-membered ring is now connected by a nonhighlighted bond to a vertex to the lower left from which a nonhighlighted bond extends to the top vertex of the five-membered ring at the lower left. An arrow labeled 4 points down to coproporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of 4 C O 2. Coproporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 is similar to uroporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 except that each red highlighted A c has been replaced by red highlighted C H 3. An arrow labeled 5 points left to protoporphyrinogen and is accompanied by an arrow that branches away to show the loss of blue highlighted 2 C O 2. Protoporphyrinogen is similar to coproporphyrinogen Roman numeral 3 except that the red highlighted C H 3 groups are no longer highlighted, the top vertex of the five-membered ring at the upper left is now connected by a vertical blue bond to a blue double bond that angles to the upper right and is labeled vinyl group, and the upper right vertex of the five-membered ring at the upper right is connected by a blue bond to a double bond that angles downward. The arrow labeled 6 is labeled protoporphyrin and is similar to protoporphyrinogen except that the vinyl groups bonded to the upper left and right five-membered rings are no longer highlighted in blue, the carbon chains connecting the rings now each contain one double bond and one single bond, the distribution of double bonds in the rings has changed, and the N atoms in the left-hand rings are no longer bonded to H. The ring at the upper left side has a single bond up to a vertex from which a double bond angles down to the upper left vertex of the ring at the upper right side, the ring at the upper right side now has a lower right vertex connected by a double bond to a vertex at the lower right from which a single bond extends down to the left to join the top vertex of the ring at the lower right side, the ring at the lower right side has a lower left vertex with a bond that angles down to the left to meet a double bond that angles up to meet the lower right vertex of the ring at the lower left side, and the ring at the lower left side has a top vertex from which a bond extends to the upper left to meet a double bond that extends up to the right to bond to the lower left vertex of the ring at the upper left. The ring at the upper left now has double bonds at the upper left and right sides and has N at the lower right vertex that is no longer bonded to H, the ring at the upper right now has a double bond at the upper right, the ring at the lower right still has upper bonds at the upper right and bottom sides, and the lower right ring now has double bonds at the lower left and upper right sides and has N at the upper right vertex that is no longer bonded to H. An arrow labeled 7 points left to heme and is accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of red highlighted F e 2 plus. Heme is similar to protoporphyrin except that none of the N atoms is bonded to an H and all of the N atoms have red arrows extending from them to point to F e 2 plus in the center of the overall structure.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ko6Bc8qYaZ">About 5,000 to 10,000 humans worldwide suffer from a genetic condition in which the activity of ferrochelatase (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_N4OInp58WY" role="presentation" src="../images/7.png"/>) is reduced, leading to abnormally high concentrations of protoporphyrin in tissues. When exposed to light, the excess protoporphyrin releases free radicals that damage cellular macromolecules, including proteins and lipids in cell membranes. The resulting cell damage and inflammation in the endothelial (skin) cells can be very painful. Patients are forced to adopt a lifestyle in which they avoid sunlight and even bright indoor light. A new drug called afamelanotide, slowly released over several months from a small implant under the skin, has shown success in alleviating the symptoms of sunlight exposure. The drug interacts with the melanocortin-1 receptor, stimulating melanin production and modulating the expression of antioxidants that eliminate the free radical species. Afamelanotide may also prove useful in treating vitiligo, a more common condition in which melanin production is not uniform and skin color is lost in blotches.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_JCHWdfYii7">One of the rarer porphyrias results in an accumulation of uroporphyrinogen I, an abnormal isomer of a protoporphyrin precursor. This compound stains the urine red, causes the teeth to fluoresce strongly in ultraviolet light, and makes the skin abnormally sensitive to sunlight. Many individuals with this porphyria are anemic because insufficient heme is synthesized. This genetic condition may have given rise to the vampire stories of folk legend.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_5sHUqtMI8y">The symptoms of many porphyrias are now readily controlled with dietary changes or the administration of heme or heme derivatives.</p>

You can monitor the reactions in the breakdown of heme (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_xCyPX9WSKs" id="dav_9781319322342_NLtiybHJsF">Fig. 22-27</a>) colorimetrically in a familiar in situ experiment. When you are bruised, the black and/or purple color results from hemoglobin released from damaged erythrocytes. Over time, the color changes to the green of biliverdin, and then to the yellow of bilirubin. Bilirubin is largely insoluble, and it travels in the bloodstream as one of many metabolites, fatty acids and others, complexed with serum albumin (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch17_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_whmSSu1PfS" id="dav_9781319322342_YYDaH6kJHC">Fig. 17-3</a>). In the liver, bilirubin is transformed to the bile pigment bilirubin diglucuronide. This product is sufficiently water-soluble to be secreted with other components of bile into the small intestine, where microbial enzymes convert it to several products, predominantly urobilinogen. Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood and transported to the kidney, where it is converted to urobilin, the compound that gives urine its yellow color. Urobilinogen remaining in the intestine is converted (in another microbe-dependent reaction) to stercobilin, which imparts the red-brown color to feces.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4sezmK6v2f">Impaired liver function or blocked bile secretion causes bilirubin to leak from the liver into the blood, resulting in a yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, a condition called jaundice. In cases of jaundice, determination of the concentration of bilirubin in the blood may be useful in the diagnosis of underlying liver disease. Newborn infants sometimes develop jaundice because they have not yet produced enough glucuronyl bilirubin transferase to process their bilirubin. A traditional treatment to reduce excess bilirubin, exposure to a fluorescent lamp, causes a photochemical conversion of bilirubin to compounds that are more soluble and easily excreted.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_u35VMgSl52">These pathways of heme breakdown play significant roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage and in regulating certain cellular functions. The CO produced by heme oxygenase is toxic at high concentrations, but at the very low concentrations generated during heme degradation it seems to have some regulatory and/or signaling functions. It acts as a vasodilator, much the same as (but less potent than) nitric oxide (discussed below). Low levels of CO also have some regulatory effects on neurotransmission. Bilirubin is the most abundant antioxidant in mammalian tissues and is responsible for most of the antioxidant activity in serum. Its protective effects seem to be especially important in the developing brain <span aria-label="819" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page819" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of newborn infants. The cell toxicity associated with jaundice may be due to bilirubin levels in excess of the serum albumin needed to solubilize it.</p>

Humans have at least three isozymes of heme oxygenase (HO). HO-1 is highly regulated; the expression of its gene is induced by a wide range of stress conditions, including shear stress, uncontrolled angiogenesis (development of blood vessels), hypoxia, hyperoxia, heat shock, exposure to ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide, and many other metabolic insults. HO-2 is found mainly in the brain and the testes, where it is continuously expressed. The third isozyme, HO-3, is not catalytically active, but may play a role in oxygen sensing. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_FLgMKushY1" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

Italicized S end italics-adenosylmethionine is a vertical six-membered chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 bonded to N H 3 on the left with a positive charge on N and to H on the right, C 3 and C 4 each bonded to 2 H, and S plus in position 5 bonded to a box labeled adenosine to the right and to C H 3 below. An arrow labeled ado M e t decarboxylase points down from italicized S end italics-adenosylmethionine to decarboxylated ado M e t. The arrow is enclosed in a brown rectangle and has P L P at the top before a curved arrow showing the loss of C O 2. Decarboxylated ado M e t has a blue highlighted top part with C H 2 bonded to N H 3 on the left with a positive charge on N and to C H 2 below further bonded to C H 2 bonded to S plus outside of the blue region that is further bonded to a box labeled adenosine to the right and to C H 3 below. Two arrows point right from decarboxylated ado M e t to intersect reactions to the right. This series of reactions to the right begins with ornithine. Ornithine is N H 3 with a positive charge on N bonded to C H 2 bonded to C H 2 bonded to C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to N H 3 above with a positive charge on N and bonded to C O O minus to the right. An arrow labeled ornithine decarboxylase points down from ornithine to putrescene. The arrow is enclosed in a brown rectangle and has P L P at the top before a curved arrow showing the loss of C O 2. This yields putrescine, which is N H 3 with a positive charge on N bonded to (C H 2) 4 bonded to N H 3 with a positive charge on N. A vertical arrow pointing down from putrescine to spermidine below is intersected by a mostly horizontal arrow from decarboxylated ado M e t to methylthioadeonosine. The point of intersection is labeled propylaminotransferase Roman numeral 1. Methylthioadenosine is C H 3 bonded to S bonded to a box labeled adenosine. Spermidine, which is bolded, has a blue highlighted portion on the left. From left to right, it is N H 3 with a positive charge on N in the blue box bonded to (C H 2) 3 in the same blue box bonded to N H outside of the blue box bonded to (C H 2) 4 bonded to N H 3 with a positive charge on N. A vertical arrow points down fro spermidine to spermine and is intersected by a mostly horizontal arrow from decarboxylated ado M e t to methylthioaenosine. The point of intersection is labeled propylaminotransferase Roman numeral 2. Spermine, which is bolded, is similar to spermidine except that the right-hand N H 3 plus has been replaced by N H that is bonded to (C H 2) 3 in a blue box further bonded to N H 3 to the right with a positive charge on N that is within the same blue box.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_zyvJpZh50m">A surprise finding in the mid-1980s was the role of nitric oxide (NO) — previously known mainly as a component of smog — as an important biological messenger. This simple gaseous substance diffuses readily through membranes, although its high reactivity limits its range of diffusion to about a 1 mm radius from the site of synthesis. In humans NO plays a role in a range of physiological processes, including neurotransmission, blood clotting, and the control of blood pressure. Its mode of action is described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_CHLZlvEAXe" id="dav_9781319322342_6QV87Kjfg2">Box 12-2</a>.</p>

Hydroxyarginine is shown in brackets and is similar to arginine except that the blue highlighted N H 2 with a positive charge on N is now N bonded to O H. An arrow labeled nitric oxide synthase points from hydroxyarginine to 2 citrulline plus 2 nitric oxide and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H, 2 O 2 and loss of N A D P plus, 2 H 2 O. 2 citrulline resembles hydroxyarginine except that C that had been bonded to the blue box containing N bonded to O H is now double bonded to O. N O with a dot in a blue box is labeled 2 nitric oxide.</p>
