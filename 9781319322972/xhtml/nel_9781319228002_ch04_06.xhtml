<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_SCABRKcCCK">In this chapter we have presented many types of protein structures. How were these structures determined? <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_BhhmVI6LJQ" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG02.png"/> Structural biology is the study of the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipid membranes, and oligosaccharides. Structural biologists combine biochemical approaches with physical tools and computational methods to obtain these structures. Structural biology is extraordinarily powerful for elucidating the relationships between the structure and function of proteins, the molecular basis for enzymatic catalysis and ligand binding, and evolutionary relationships between proteins. Here we focus primarily on three commonly used methods in structural biology: x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Which method a structural biologist uses depends on the system being studied and what information is to be learned. Often structural biologists combine multiple methods to provide a more complete view of function.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_VA3Cg7ep1v">Computational tools are now indispensable to biochemistry. While advances in computers and software have revolutionized how protein structures can be solved by x-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM, advances in computational chemistry have now allowed a number of studies of protein structure to be carried out entirely in silico using powerful molecular modeling and dynamics software. Key developments in this field were made by Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, and Arieh Warshel, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013 for their work on the theoretical and computational tools needed to carry out computer simulations of molecules as large as proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_1f91RCQ3BC">Protein folding is a problem particularly well-suited for computational biochemists. Protein-folding landscapes can be complex, and nearly an infinite number of possible peptide conformations are theoretically available for the protein to sample as it folds. However, to understand how folding happens efficiently and by only sampling a small portion of all possible conformations requires computers that can quickly test tens of thousands of possible folding trajectories in a brief time. Sometimes these calculations are carried out on powerful supercomputers, but in other instances research groups have taken to crowdsourcing these problems to thousands of citizen scientists.</p>

The Rosetta@home project distributes complex protein-folding problems to citizen scientists who run the software in the background on their home computers. Each home computer is able to complete a portion of a protein-folding experiment, and these results can be combined with those from other users to predict protein structures.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8ZoqudMW1k">Foldit is a video game in which users compete to solve protein-folding puzzles (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vQwj8SoGIj" id="dav_9781319322342_grDbZXCc7X">Fig. 1</a>). Users are rewarded for making stabilizing contacts in the structure, like hydrogen bonds or favorable van der Waals interactions. Virtual protein designs (sometimes called theozymes) from the video game can then be tested in the real world. DNA genes coding for the virtual proteins can be created in the laboratory and be used to recombinantly produce the proteins in bacteria, using techniques described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch09_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_iNKSWEBZuH" id="dav_9781319322342_P849qazJAd">Chapter 9</a>.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_XaGnG0zgnz">One exciting application of computational biochemistry is the creation of “designer proteins.” These are proteins with completely novel folds or functions not yet identified in nature. Designer proteins have potential applications in bioengineering, medicine, materials science, and chemistry. In one recent example, the Baker Lab designed a series of Foldit puzzles (such as “Cover the Ligand,” in which users had to redesign a ligand-binding site by rebuilding the protein backbone and changing amino acid side chains) to improve the catalytic efficiency of a previously engineered Diels-Alderase (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_wCDcOIosaQ" id="dav_9781319322342_8K1ox3tSIJ">Fig. 2</a>). The Diels-Alder reaction is a common method for organic chemists to create carbon–carbon bonds; however, it is almost never used by naturally occurring enzymes. Diels-Alderase enzymes would potentially be useful for carrying out environmentally friendly carbon bond forming reactions in water instead of toxic organic solvents. Foldit competitors used the video game to design thousands of virtual enzymes. The players were successful, and once their top virtual enzyme was produced and tested in the real world it was found to be more than 18-fold more active than the original Diels-Alderase. Incredibly, the protein structure created by the Foldit game players was also confirmed by x-ray crystallography. This is definitely a case where we can encourage biochemistry students to spend more time playing video games!</p>

The spacing of the different kinds of atoms in complex organic molecules, even very large ones such as proteins, can also be analyzed by x-ray diffraction methods. However, the technique for analyzing crystals of complex molecules is far more laborious than the technique for analyzing simple salt crystals. When the repeating pattern of the crystal is a molecule as large as, say, a protein, the numerous atoms in the molecule yield thousands of diffraction spots that must be analyzed by computer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_vWjrmenCLA">Consider how images are generated in a light microscope. Light from a point source is focused on an object. The object scatters the light waves, and these scattered waves are recombined by a series of lenses to generate an enlarged image of the object. The smallest object whose structure can be determined by such a system — that is, the resolving power of the microscope — is determined by the wavelength of the light, in this case visible light, with wavelengths in the range of 400 to 700 nm. Objects smaller than half the wavelength of the incident light cannot be resolved. To resolve objects as small as proteins we must use x-rays, with wavelengths in the range of 0.7 to 1.5 Å (0.07 to 0.15 nm). However, there are no lenses that can recombine x-rays to form an image; instead, the pattern of diffracted x-rays is collected directly and an image is reconstructed by mathematical techniques.</p>

Some important structural parameters were obtained from early studies of the diffraction patterns of the fibrous proteins arranged in regular arrays in hair and wool. However, the orderly bundles formed by fibrous proteins are not crystals — the molecules are aligned side by side, but not all are oriented in the same direction. More-detailed three-dimensional structural information about proteins requires a highly ordered protein crystal. The structures of many proteins are not yet known, simply because they have proved difficult to crystallize. Practitioners have compared making protein crystals to holding together a stack of bowling balls with cellophane tape.</p>

A crystal is placed in an x-ray beam between the x-ray source and a detector, and a regular array of spots, called reflections, is generated. The spots are created by the diffracted x-ray beam, and each atom in a molecule makes a contribution to each spot. An electron-density map of the protein is reconstructed <span aria-label="137" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from the overall diffraction pattern of spots by a mathematical technique called a Fourier transform. In effect, the computer acts as a “computational lens.” A model for the structure is then built that is consistent with the electron-density map.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_DcHnBrBDWC">John Kendrew found that the x-ray diffraction pattern of crystalline myoglobin (isolated from muscles of the sperm whale) is highly complex, with nearly 25,000 reflections. Computer analysis of these reflections took place in stages. The resolution improved at each stage until, in 1959, the positions of virtually all the nonhydrogen atoms in the protein had been determined. The amino acid sequence of the protein, obtained by chemical analysis, was consistent with the molecular model. Over 100,000 protein structures, many of them much more complex than myoglobin, have since been determined to a similar level of resolution by x-ray crystallography.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_uKcwa1S33U">The physical environment in a crystal, of course, is not identical to that in solution or in a living cell. A crystal imposes a space and time average on the structure deduced from its analysis, and x-ray diffraction studies provide little information about molecular motion within the protein. The conformation of proteins in a crystal can also be affected by nonphysiological factors such as incidental protein-protein contacts within the crystal. However, when structures derived from the analysis of crystals are compared with structural information obtained by other means (such as NMR, as described below), the crystal-derived structure almost always represents a functional conformation of the protein.</p>

The patterns and intensities of the diffracted x-rays depend on the structure of the protein and its crystalline properties. Mathematical methods can then reconstruct the protein structure that produces a particular diffraction pattern.</li>

Protein structures can be computed from NMR data using hundreds of distance and geometric constraints obtained from multi-dimensional NMR experiments.</li>

The individual molecules are then identified and computationally sorted. The sorted two-dimensional images are then combined using computers to produce a three-dimensional structure.</li>
