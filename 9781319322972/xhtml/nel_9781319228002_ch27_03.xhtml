<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_OxkskccPmz">As we have seen for DNA and RNA (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_LFzXxGmZkg">Chapters 25</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_33S0Ppohon">26</a>), the synthesis of polymeric biomolecules can be considered in terms of initiation, elongation, and termination stages. These fundamental processes are typically bracketed by two additional stages: activation of precursors before synthesis and postsynthetic processing of the completed polymer. Protein synthesis follows the same pattern. The activation of amino acids before their incorporation into polypeptides and the posttranslational processing of the completed polypeptide play particularly important roles in ensuring both the fidelity of synthesis and the proper function of the protein product. The process is outlined in <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_WtIQLmCxBQ"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_IjTH14nJ3R" id="dav_9781319322342_ZNIG96b3XW">Figure 27-13</a></strong>. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_vA4MHleTdu" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> The cellular components involved in the five stages of protein synthesis in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ou0zdRxjMK">E. coli</i> and other bacteria are listed in <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_EpY4RPUMri"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_DFpFrdI6Mc" id="dav_9781319322342_OUU2rWYvI0">Table 27-5</a></strong>; the requirements in eukaryotic cells are similar, although the components are usually more numerous.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Z1oW64BTmV">A t R N A is shown as a green coiled structure that is vertical to a thicker top part that extends to a purple upper right tip and that has a half-circle yellow base with the flat side facing down. Step 1: Activation of amino acids: the t R N A is aminoacylated. An arrow points right accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of a blue sphere. This yields a similar t R N A with a blue sphere attached to the purple tip at the upper right. It is adjacent to a roughly rectangular orange structure that is wider at the top than at the bottom with rounded edges. An arrow shows that these join a cycle of reactions by meeting an arrow from m R N A at just before the nine o’clock position that runs to the eleven o’clock position. The m R N A is green with a dark green bar near the left labeled start and a red bar near the right labeled stop. This reaction yields a structure in which the green R N A strand has its 5 prime end at the lower left of the orange structure, curves up, runs horizontally, and then bends down again to exit at the lower right to run horizontally to its 3 prime end just past the red piece. The green piece is at the top horizontal piece within the orange structure directly beneath the yellow base of aminoacyl-t R N A. The t R N A extends above the orange structure. Step 2: Initiation: the m R N A and the aminoacylated t R N A bind to the small ribosomal subunit. The large subunit then binds. An arrow points right to the two o’clock position and is joined by a curve line showing the addition of a large yellow half-circle. This produces a similar structure in which the yellow piece is on top of the orange piece with the t R N A extending into the yellow structure. An arrow points from this structure to the four o’clock position accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of another aminoacyl-t R N A. This yields a similar structure in which there is a second t R N A just to the right of the first t R N A. The blue spheres of the two t R N A s are touching. An arrow points right from this position to the six o’clock position. Step 3: Elongation: successive cycles of aminoacyl-t R N A binding and peptide bond formation occur until the ribosome reaches a stop codon. This yields a similar structure in which most of the green R N A is outside of the ribosome, forming a long horizontal piece with a green bar at its left side. This R N A curves up and runs almost horizontally across the orange piece of the ribosome, then curves down slightly. A t R N A is bound just to the left of the red piece of this R N A. A long strand of blue spheres extends up from the purple tip of the t R N A. An arrow points from this position back to the original m R N A at just before the nine o’clock position accompanied by a branched arrow showing the departure of the two halves of the ribosome. A wavy chain of blue spheres is below. Step 4: Termination: translation stops when a stop codon is encountered. The m R N A and protein dissociate, and the ribosomal subunits are recycled. An arrow points down from the chain of blue spheres to show the same spheres arranged into a spherical structure. Step 5: Protein folding and posttranslational processing. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of two light red spheres. This yields a similar structure with two light red spheres attached. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8SYKRsHTnd">As it became clear that ribosomes are the complexes responsible for protein synthesis, and following elucidation of the genetic code, the study of ribosomes accelerated. In the late 1960s Masayasu Nomura and colleagues demonstrated that both ribosomal subunits can be broken down into their RNA and protein components, then reconstituted in vitro. Ribosomal subunits are identified by their S (Svedberg unit) values, sedimentation coefficients that refer to their rate of sedimentation in a centrifuge. <span aria-label="1016" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1016" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Under appropriate experimental conditions, the RNA and protein spontaneously reassemble to form 30S or 50S subunits nearly identical in structure and activity to native subunits. This breakthrough fueled decades of research into the function and structure of ribosomal RNAs and proteins. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated structural methods revealed more and more details about ribosome structure.</p>

First, a traditional focus on the protein components of ribosomes was shifted. The ribosomal subunits are huge RNA molecules. In the 50S subunit, the 5S and 23S rRNAs form the structural core. The proteins are secondary elements in the complex, decorating the surface. Second, and most important, there is no protein within 18 Å of the active site for peptide bond formation. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_VAbrRbJy50" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> The high-resolution structure thus confirms what Noller had predicted much earlier: the ribosome is a ribozyme. In addition to the insight that the detailed structures of the ribosome and its subunits provide into the mechanism of protein synthesis (as elaborated below), these findings have stimulated a new look at the evolution of life (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_FGEsuVgDes" id="dav_9781319322342_bSlayGbdA7">Section 26.4</a>).

Pol Roman numeral 1 is a purple oval. The D N A bends diagonally down to the right as it separates within Pol Roman numeral 1. An arrow points down to a horizontal series of steps in 35 S r R N A production. Pol Roman numeral 3 is a yellow vertical oval that contains a more symmetrical bubble. An arrow point down from it to 5 S r R N A, shown as a green piece of R N A that has a short horizontal start before running up vertically, forming a small loop, and running back down vertically to end with a short horizontal piece to the right. The two vertical sides are joined by bonds indicated by blue lines. Below and to the left, 35 S r R N A is shown. To the far left, the 5 prime end of a green strand of 35 S r R N A runs horizontally for a very short distance, then runs vertically upward, forms a loop, and runs vertically downward. The upward and downward vertical pieces are joined by blue bonds. The right-hand horizontal piece curves upward to form a circular loop above the word folding. Three linear structures extend from this circle: one on the left, one at the top, and one on the right. The left-hand and right-hand structures are similar. Each has two vertical strands joined by bonds with a loop at the end, but the left-hand one is longer. The piece extending from the top also has two vertical strands, but a loop protrudes from the lower right and a second loop protrudes from the upper right in addition to the loop at the top.

Arrows point from red spheres labeled assembly factors in the nucleoplasm to the purple piece with red spheres and to the pink pieces to its right. The purple and pink structures are labeled pre-ribosomal particles. Arrows point down from both the purple and pink structures into the nucleoplasm. Arrows point from this purple structure with red spheres in the nucleoplasm to a cluster of red spheres labeled assembly factors to the upper right from which an arrow points back to the purple and pink pre-ribosomal particles in the nucleolus. The arrow from the purple structure points to a similar structure labeled pre-40 S in the nucleoplasm. A horizontal line beneath representing the nuclear envelope has oval regions bounded by yellow with rounded pieces in between made up of many circles with wavy vertical lines extending down from them and with lines extending up to a horizontal line across the top. Each is curved to fit around the ovals between them. An arrow points down from the pre-40 S purple structure across an oval next to the word export, to a similar structure with no red spheres labeled 40 S in the cytoplasm on the other side of the horizontal line with oval regions. An arrow points from this 40 S purple subunit to a structure with both purple and pink subunits assembled together around a green strand of R N A with a strand of blue spheres extending out from the top of the pink part. This structure is labeled 80 S and the process is labeled translation. The pink pre-ribosomal particles have an arrow pointing from the nucleus into the nucleoplasm, where a pink sphere labeled pre-60 S is shown with two red spheres attached and a crescent-shaped dark pink piece across its upper right. An arrow points down to show a pink sphere with two red spheres attached. An arrow points from this pink sphere to the assembly factors from which arrows point back up to the pre-ribosomal particles. Another arrow points down from this pink sphere through an oval in the horizontal structure below past the word export to a pink sphere with no red spheres in the cytoplasm labeled 60 S. An arrow points from this to the assembled ribosome participating in translation at the lower right. An arrow points up from the 80 S ribosome engaged in translation to an assortment of small purple and pink particles labeled ribosomal proteins beneath an oval in the nuclear membrane. An arrow points from these proteins across an oval in the nuclear envelope next to the word import. The arrow splits and points to both a pink sphere with two red spheres attached in the nucleoplasm and to pink preribosomal particles in the nucleolus. In the nucleoplasm to the right, pol Roman numeral 2 is shown as a rounded structure with an opening in the middle and a protrusion to the upper left. Two blue horizontal lines representing double-stranded D N A run through it. Two arrows point downward. One arrow points down to a green strand with a red bottom tip and a string of 5 A bases at the upper end labeled m R N As. An arrow points down from this through an oval in the nuclear envelope to the functional ribosome at the lower right that is translating an m R N A. The second arrow points to a green structure labeled s n o R N As that has a light green horizontal line with a vertical piece on the left that ends in a loop and a longer vertical piece on the right that has a loop to the right and a loop above. An arrow points up from this to the r R N A undergoing modification in the nucleolus.</p>

The tRNAs of bacteria and in the cytosol of eukaryotes have between 73 and 93 nucleotide residues, corresponding to molecular weights of 24,000 to 31,000. Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain distinctive, somewhat smaller tRNAs. Cells have at least one kind of tRNA for each amino acid; at least 32 tRNAs are required to recognize all the amino acid codons (some recognize more than one codon), but some cells use more than 32.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_7DJBnSI4i1">Part a shows a t R N A as a structure with vertical protrusions that end in loops on the right side, bottom, and left and a vertical protrusion with no loop extending upward. The upper portion consists of two parallel vertical sides connected by blue bonds. It is green and begins with a dot at the right end of the left-hand protrusion, labeled the D arm. It curves up through a U, then has seven dots connected by blue bonds to dots on the right-hand vertical half before ending at the 5 prime end. The right half is similar but begins above the curve from the right-hand arm, labeled the T psi C arm, to consist of seven dots connected by blue bonds to the left-hand vertical half. After the seventh dot, it has a purple portion that begins with P u at the bottom and continues up as C C A to the 3 prime end. This is labeled amino acid arm. The left-hand horizontal protrusion has a horizontal paired region of four dots on each half connected by bonds. After the fourth dot to the left, the top part has an A that begins a loop that has a dot, then P u, then a dot, then G with an asterisk, then G, then A, then a dot beneath A above and unpaired before rejoining the paired region. This end is called the D arm. Text below reads, Contains two or three D residues at different positions. The bottom vertical portion is green. At the end of the bottom yellow strand, it meets a green strand with a dot as it curves that leads to the left-hand side of a vertical piece of five dots paired with dots on the right-hand side of this vertical portion. On the left side, the vertical portion ends with a bend to the left to begin a loop with P y, then U, then three dots across the bottom of the loop that are enclosed in a box and highlighted in yellow, then a green strand of P u followed by a dot before reaching the right-hand vertical paired portion. The left-hand dot of the yellow region in the box is labeled wobble position and a bracket indicates that this yellow portion is the anticodon with its 5 prime end on the left and its 3 prime end on the right. This is labeled anticodon arm. At the top of the right-hand side of the paired vertical portion of this bottom piece, there is a loop that extends a short distance diagonally to the lower left that consists of five green spheres. This is labeled extra arm, variable in size, not present in all t R N As. A small green piece joins this loop to the bottom blue strand of the right-hand horizontal piece, where there are four dots connected by blue bonds to dots in a parallel blue strand above. In the fifth position, G on the bottom strand is bonded to C on the upper strand. After G, the lower strand begins a loop with T, psi, C, then four dots before returning to the horizontal top strand. This is labeled T psi C arm. Part b shows a schematic diagram of a folded t R N A. It has a green vertical portion at the bottom labeled anticodon with 32 at the lower left corner of the bottom loop, a short yellow region labeled anticodon on the lower right of the bottom loop, and 38 at the upper right of the bottom loop. A double stranded vertical portion twists and meets an orange region at a point labeled 26. Just above it to the left, there is a piece of the double stranded green vertical portion labeled 44. The orange region angles to the upper left. It has 12 at the upper right and 20 near its upper left near the center of a loop at the upper left. A bracket indicates that this is the D arm (residues 10 to 25). At the upper left of the orange region, a blue region bends horizontally to the right. Its left-hand corner is labeled 46, the top of its first double-stranded loop is labeled 54, and the top of its second double stranded loop is labeled 64. A bracket indicates that this region is the T psi C arm. A green portion to the right, connected to the blue region and to a green strand from below that runs past a position labeled 7, is double stranded and extends to the upper right. It has 1 at the upper right just before its 5 prime end. At its lower left, it has 69. It has 72 at its upper right just before a purple portion that ends at a protrusion labeled A A right before the 3 prime end. A bracket indicates that the region from the end of the blue part to this purple part is the acid arm.</p>

Both these requirements are met by attaching the amino acid to a tRNA in the first stage of protein synthesis. When attached to their amino acid (aminoacylated), the tRNAs are said to be “charged.”</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_IlVzNDEc7Q">This first stage of protein synthesis takes place in the cytosol. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases esterify the 20 amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. Each enzyme is specific for one amino acid and one or more corresponding tRNAs. Most organisms have one aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. For amino acids with two or more corresponding tRNAs, the same enzyme usually aminoacylates all of them.</p>

It is added to A T P, shown as P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus to the left and below, and bonded to O to the right further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the right further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the right further bonded to C 5 prime bonded to 2 H and to C 4 prime of a five-membered sugar ring. The sugar has C 1 prime bonded to a box labeled adenine above and to H below; C 2 prime and C 3 prime bonded to H above and O H below; and C 4 prime bonded to H below and C 5 prime above. Red arrows point from the negative charge on O at the right end of the amino acid to the right-hand P of A T P and from the bond between the same P and O to its left to the same O. Step 1: Carboxyl of amino acid attacks alpha phosphorus of A T P, forming 5 prime-aminoacyl adenylate. An arrow points down accompanied by a branched arrow showing the loss of P P subscript i end subscript. This yields 5 prime-aminoacyl adenylate (aminoacyl-A M P), in which the same ring bonded to adenine has C 5 prime bonded to 2 H and to O to the left further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the left within the blue rectangle further bonded to C double bonded to O below and bonded to C to the left further bonded to N H 3 below with a positive charge on N, to R to the left, and to H above within the same blue rectangle. Arrows point down to the lower left and lower right. The left-hand arrow is accompanied by blue text reading, class Roman numeral 1 aminoacyl-t R N A synthetases. It yields aminoacyl-A M P, shown as a box labeled adenosine bonded to O further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O in a blue rectangle to the left that is further bonded to C double bonded to O below and bonded to C to the left bonded to N H 3 below with a positive charge on N, to R on the left, and to H above, all within the same blue box. To the left, the 3 prime end of t R N A is shown as a box labeled adenine bonded to C 1 prime of a five-membered ring oriented so that C 1 prime is at the top vertex and O is at the left side vertex. C 1 prime is bonded to adenine to the left and H to the right, C 2 prime is bonded to H on the left and to O H to the right with a red pair of electrons on O, C 3 prime is bonded to H to the left and O H to the right, C 4 prime is bonded to C 5 prime to the left and H to the right, and C 5 prime is bonded to 2 H and to O below further bonded to P below that is double bonded to O to the right, bonded to O minus to the left, and bonded to O below attached to the purple tip of a green t R N A with a yellow half-circle base with its flat side facing downward. Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on O to C double bonded to O within the blue rectangle and from the bond between the same C in the blue rectangle and O to its right and the same O. Step 2a: Aminoacyl group is transferred to the 2 prime – O H of the 3 prime-terminal A residue of t R N A, releasing A M P. A similar molecule is shown bound to t R N A below except that the five-membered ring has C 3 prime bonded to H on the left and O H with a red pair of electrons on O and also has C 2 prime bonded to H on the left and to C on the right within the blue box that is double bonded to O below and bonded to C to the right further bonded to H above, R to the right, and N H 3 with a positive charge on N below. Red arrows point from the bond between C in the blue box and O bonded to C 2 prime and from the red pair of electrons on O bonded to C 3 prime to the same C in the blue box. Step 3a: Transesterification moves the aminoacyl group to the 3 prime – OH of the same t R N A residue, generating the aminoacyl-t R N A product. An arrow points right beneath the word transesterification. This yields aminoacyl-t R N A, a similar molecule in which C 2 prime of the sugar ring is bonded to H to the left and O H to the right and C 3 prime of the sugar ring is bonded to H to the left and to O to the right further bonded to C in the blue rectangle double bonded to O below and bonded to C to the right bonded to H above, R to the right, and N H 3 with a positive charge on N below within the same blue box. This is labeled aminoacyl-A M P. The second arrow from 5 prime-aminoacyl adenylate (aminoacyl-A M P), which points to the lower right, is accompanied by blue text reading, class Roman numeral 2 aminoacyl-t R N A synthetases. This yields aminoacyl-A M P, shown as a box labeled adenosine bonded to O further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O in a blue rectangle to the left that is further bonded to C double bonded to O below and bonded to C to the left bonded to N H 3 below with a positive charge on N, to R on the left, and to H above, all within the same blue box. To the left, the 3 prime end of t R N A is shown as a box labeled adenine bonded to C 1 prime of a five-membered ring oriented so that C 1 prime is at the top vertex and O is at the left side vertex. C 1 prime is bonded to adenine to the left and H to the right, C 2 prime is bonded to H to the left and to O H to the right, C 3 prime is bonded to H to the left and O H to the right with a red pair of electrons on O, C 4 prime is bonded to C 5 prime to the left and H to the right, and C 5 prime is bonded to 2 H and to O below further bonded to P below that is double bonded to O to the right, bonded to O minus to the left, and bonded to O below attached to the purple tip of a green t R N A with a yellow half-circle base with its flat side facing downward. Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on O to C double bonded to O within the blue rectangle and from the bond between the same C in the blue rectangle and O to its right and the same O. Step 2b: Aminoacyl group is transferred directly to the 3 prime – O H of the 3 prime-terminal A residue of t R N A, generating the aminoacyl-t R N A product. This generates aminoacyl-t R N A, the same molecule produced after transesterification through the previous pathway.</p>

How is this greater-than-10-fold increase in accuracy brought about? Ile-tRNA synthetase, like some other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, has a proofreading function.</p>

The effect of forcing the system through two successive filters is multiplicative. In the case of Ile-tRNA synthetase, the first filter is the initial binding of the amino acid to the enzyme and its activation to aminoacyl-AMP. The second is the binding of any <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_9561pei1Ho">incorrect</i> aminoacyl-AMP products to a separate active site on the enzyme; a substrate that binds in this second active site is hydrolyzed. The R group of valine is slightly smaller than that of isoleucine, so Val-AMP fits the hydrolytic (proofreading) site of the Ile-tRNA synthetase, but Ile-AMP does not. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_eTulDx1qXS" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> Thus Val-AMP is hydrolyzed to valine and AMP in the proofreading active site, and tRNA bound to the synthetase does not become aminoacylated to the wrong amino acid.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_NkcxT6UYMZ">In addition to proofreading after formation of the aminoacyl-AMP intermediate, most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can hydrolyze the ester linkage between amino acids and tRNAs in the aminoacyl-tRNAs. This hydrolysis is greatly accelerated for incorrectly charged tRNAs, providing yet a third filter to enhance the fidelity of the overall process. The few aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that activate amino acids with no close structural relatives (Cys-tRNA synthetase, for example) demonstrate little or no proofreading activity; in these cases, the active site for aminoacylation can sufficiently discriminate between the proper substrate and any incorrect amino acid.</p>

Discriminating among dozens of tRNAs is just as important for the overall fidelity of protein biosynthesis as is distinguishing among amino acids. The interaction between aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and tRNAs has been referred to as the “second genetic code,” reflecting its critical role in maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis. The “coding” rules appear to be more complex than those in the “first” code.</p>

Some nucleotides are conserved in all tRNAs and therefore cannot be used for discrimination. Nucleotide positions necessary for discrimination by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases seem to be concentrated in the amino acid arm and the anticodon arm, including the nucleotides of the anticodon itself. A few are located in other parts of the tRNA molecule. Determination of the crystal structures of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases complexed with their cognate tRNAs and ATP has added a great deal to our understanding of these interactions (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_TW0H8ry19c"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_yGUZUjpTio" id="dav_9781319322342_2Q3iCRmW4R">Fig. 27-22</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_dcn9VpL1P5">As we have seen, the 20 standard amino acids found in proteins offer only limited chemical functionality. Living systems generally overcome these limitations by using enzymatic cofactors or by modifying particular amino acids after they have been incorporated into proteins. In principle, expansion of the genetic code to introduce new amino acids into proteins offers another route to new functionality, but it is a very difficult route to exploit. Such a change might just as easily result in inactivation of thousands of cellular proteins.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_8kJk7f3OzN">Expanding the genetic code to include a new amino acid requires several cellular changes. A new aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase must generally be present, along with a cognate tRNA. Both of these components must be highly specific, interacting only with each other and the new amino acid. Significant concentrations of the new amino acid must be present in the cell, which may entail the evolution of new metabolic pathways. As outlined in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_9oVuvi0j14" id="dav_9781319322342_rzAfIDawKJ">Box 27-1</a>, the anticodon on the tRNA would most likely pair with a codon that usually specifies termination.

The charged tRNA does not recognize just any UGA codon; some contextual signal in the mRNA, still to be identified, ensures that this tRNA recognizes only the few UGA codons, within certain genes, that specify selenocysteine. In effect, UGA doubles as a codon for both termination and (very occasionally) selenocysteine. This particular code expansion has a dedicated tRNA, as described above, but it lacks a dedicated cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The process works for selenocysteine, but one might consider it an intermediate step in the evolution of a complete new codon definition.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_G4sixz23QE">Pyrrolysine is found in a group of anaerobic archaea called methanogens (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_bBoVntlWVh" id="dav_9781319322342_32Xq5FH5Vu">Box 22-1</a>). These organisms produce methane as a required part of their metabolism, and the Methanosarcinaceae family can use methylamines as substrates for methanogenesis. Producing methane from monomethylamine requires the enzyme monomethylamine methyltransferase. The gene encoding this enzyme has an in-frame UAG termination codon. The structure of the methyltransferase was elucidated in 2002, revealing the presence of the novel amino acid pyrrolysine at the position specified by the UAG codon. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that — unlike selenocysteine — pyrrolysine is attached directly to a dedicated tRNA by a cognate pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase. These methanogens produce pyrrolysine via a metabolic pathway that remains to be elucidated. The overall system has all the hallmarks of an established codon assignment, although it works only for UAG codons in this particular gene. As in the case of selenocysteine, there are probably contextual signals that direct this tRNA to the correct UAG codon.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_yOEcX7xzEh">Can scientists match this evolutionary feat? Modification of proteins with various functional groups can provide important insights into the activity and/or structure of the proteins. However, protein modification is often laborious. For example, an investigator who wishes to attach a new group to a particular Cys residue will have to somehow block other Cys residues that may be present on the same protein. If one could instead adapt the genetic code to enable a cell to insert a modified amino acid at a particular location in a protein, the process could be rendered much more convenient. Peter Schultz and coworkers have done just that.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_AsU9Z1tv4z">A roughly rectangular orange structure labeled 30 S subunit has rounded edges and is wider at the top than at the bottom. It has a roughly rectangular cutout at the top center that is lower at its left and right edges than at the center. This cutout is divided into three parts. From left to right, these are E, P, and A. A purple circle labeled I F 3 is shown with an arrow pointing to the E site and a purple oval labeled I F 1 is shown with an arrow pointing to the A site. Step 1: The 30 S subunit binds I F 1 and I F 3, then the m R N A. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of m R N A. This yields a similar structure in which I F 3 is at the top of the E site and I F 1 fills the A site. A strand of m R N A begins at a short green 5 prime end at the lower left of the orange structure and bends upwards as a dark orange region labeled Shine-Dalgarno sequence. A small purple strand labeled 16 S r R N A runs beneath this orange region. Halfway across the bottom of the E site, the strand becomes green again, then becomes dark green as it runs beneath the P site. This dark green region contains text reading A U G. There is a yellow part beneath I F 1 along the bottom of the A site. The strand then becomes green again as it bends down out of the orange structure and then runs horizontally to end at the 3 prime end to the right. Step 2: I F 2-G T P binds the 30 S subunit and recruits f M e t-t R N A superscript f M e t end superscript. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of a purple sphere labeled I F 2 bonded to G T P. A second curved line shows the addition of a green t R N A with a yellow anticodon and a purple tip at the top bonded to a blue sphere labeled f M e t. The yellow anticodon is labeled with its 3 prime end on the left and its 5 prime end on the right. Text within the anticodon reads, U A C. This yields a similar structure in which the purple sphere labeled I F 2 bonded to G T P is above I F 1 in the A site and the t R N A is in the P site with its anticodon, U A C, bonded to the codon of R N A, A U G. Step 3: The 50 S subunit associates, I F 2 hydrolyzes G T P, and I F 1, I F 2, and I F 3 dissociate, leaving the 70 S initiation complex. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of the 50 S subunit. A branched arrow shows the loss of G D P plus P subscript i end subscript. A second branched arrow shows the loss of I F 1, I F 2, and I F 3. This yields a similar structure in which I F 1, I F 2, and I F 3 are gone. A yellow half-circle labeled 50 S subunit has moved into position above the orange subunit and the E, P, and A sites now extend into a cutout in this yellow structure. The t R N A is still present. The yellow region beneath the A site is labeled, next codon. This structure is labeled, 70 S initiation complex.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_uLJiPixNmU">A roughly rectangular purple piece that is wider at the top than at the bottom is labeled 40 S subunit has a roughly rectangular cutout across the top that is deeper at the left and right with a rounded, higher center base. This cutout is divided into three regions from left to right: E, P, and A. A small purple sphere labeled e l F 1 is shown with an arrow to E, a large purple sphere labeled e l F 3 is shown with an arrow to P, and a purple oval labeled e l F 1 A I is shown with an arrow to A. An arrow labeled 1 point down to show the same roughly rectangular structure with the large e l F 3 sphere emerging from behind its lower left, with the small e l F 1 sphere at the top of the opening labeled E, and with the e l F 1 A oval in position A. An arrow labeled 2 points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of t R N A, shown as a vertical green structure made up of a green strand with a half-circle yellow at the bottom with a 3 prime to 5 prime anticodon reading U A C at its flat base, with a purple top at the top joined to a blue sphere labeled M e t, and with a large purple sphere labeled e l F 2 and bonded to G T P bound to the upper left of the green part with its upper right edge touching M e t. A second branched arrow shows the addition of a purple sphere labeled e L F 5 B bound to G T P. This yields a purple rounded rectangular structure labeled 43 S preinitiation complex with the large e l F 3 sphere emerging from below the lower left side, the small e l F 1 sphere at the top of the left-hand E opening, t R N A in the central P opening with the lower left of e l F 2 bound to G T P at its upper left adjacent to the upper right of e l F 1, and with oval e l F 1 A in the right-hand A site with the e 1 F 5 B sphere bound to G T P joined above and behind it. An arrow labeled 3 points upward accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of a green strand that meets the arrow at the same point as the inflection point of a curved arrow showing the addition of A T P and loss of A D P plus P subscript i end subscript. The green strand has a red 5 prime end that crosses into a rectangular cutout in a purple structure labeled e l F 4 F that has protrusions to the upper right and left from a horizontal base, making it resemble an elongated “C” that opens upward. The red piece of the strand runs across the front of the left-hand protrusion of e l F 4 F and then becomes green, then the green strand exits behind the right-hand protrusion of e L F 4 F before reaching a dark yellow piece labeled A U G, two parallel lines that show a cut in the strand, and the green 3 prime end to the right. This yields a purple structure that is similar to the previous one except that now the green strand and e l F 4 F have been added. The 5 prime red end of the strand begins by running across the protrusion to the upper left of e l F 4 F and ends as it reaches the bottom of the E site, then the strand bends horizontally to run beneath the E and A sites. The green strand runs beneath the protrusion to the upper right of e l F 4 F, which extends up to contact the bottom of the purple oval labeled e l F 1 A in the A site. The green strand then bends down out of the purple structure before running horizontally right. This horizontal part includes the dark green segment labeled A U G, the break, and then the 3 prime end. The overall structure is labeled 48 S complex. An arrow labeled 4 points up and to the right accompanied by text reading, scanning. This yields a similar structure in which the red cap of R N A has its 5 prime end to the right of the protrusion from the upper left of e l F 4 F and curves down to form a loop that extends to the lower left of the complex before bending upward to position the dark green A U G beneath the yellow U A C in the anticodon of t R N A in the P site. A U G runs almost horizontally, then the line curves down behind the protrusion to the upper right of e l F 4 F and diagonally down across the lower right of the structure through the part with the diagonally set of lines shown a cut before reaching it s3 prime end. An arrow labeled 5 points downward accompanied by two branched arrows. The left-hand branched arrow shows the loss of three purple spheres: e l F 5 B bound to G D P plus P subscript I end subscript, e l F 2 bound to G D P plus P subscript I end subscript, and e l F 1. The right-hand branched arrow shows the loss of the large purple sphere labeled e l F 3 and the purple oval labeled e l F 1 A. A curved line shows the addition of the 60 S subunit. This yields a structure with the purple roughly rectangular part below and a half-circle pink part above that is flat across the bottom where it meets the purple part. The E, P, and A sites extend into a cutout in the pink part. The P site still contains t R N A with its U A C anticodon bound to A U G in the green strand below. The entire pink and purple structure is labeled 80 S. The green strand runs left from A U G beneath the P site and then down to a horizontal piece that runs left to end by running behind the right-hand upward protrusion of e l F 4 F and then having its red left end run across the front of the left-hand upward protrusion of e l F 4 F, where it ends at its 5 prime end. To the right of A U G beneath the P site, the green strand curves slowly and then more rapidly down to the lower right before becoming more horizontal and reaching the double diagonal lines representing a cut just before the 3 prime end.</p>

The eIF5B protein is homologous to the bacterial IF2. It hydrolyzes its bound GTP and triggers dissociation of eIF2-GDP and other initiation factors, followed closely by association of the 60S subunit.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_sn3DgeUlqe">A roughly rectangular orange piece with rounded edges that is wider at the top than at the bottom is labeled 30 S. A yellow half-circle above it with its flat side against the 30 S subunit is labeled 50 S. Cutouts in the bottom of the yellow piece and top of the orange piece meet to form an opening divided into three parts. The left-hand part is labeled, E, the middle part contains t R N A, and the right-hand part is labeled A. The t R N A is a vertical green structure made up of a strand with a purple tip that joins to a blue sphere labeled f M e t and a yellow half-circle at the bottom with a flat base that contains the bases U A C. A strand of m R N A begins with a green piece to the lower left, then curves upward as an orange piece before bending almost horizontally at a green piece beneath E before reaching a dark green piece reading A U G and labeled start codon. A U G is paired with U A C of the t R N A above and angles slightly downward. TO its right, there is a yellow segment labeled next codon beneath the A side. The strand then becomes green and curves down the top lower right before running horizontally to end at its 3 prime end. An arrow points down to a similar structure at the upper left of a cycle of arrows. A second t R N A is moving into the A site. It is at a slight angle, pointing from upper right to lower left, but an arrow shows that it is moving into a vertical position. It is similar to the first t R N A except that the blue sphere is labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript instead of f M e t and it has a purple sphere labeled T u bound to the upper right of the green part with its upper left side against the blue sphere. T u is bonded to G T P. An arrow labeled G T P hydrolysis and accommodation points down and a branched arrow curves off into the cycle of arrows. The first branched arrow points to a purple sphere labeled T U bonded to G D P plus P subscript i end subscript. An arrow points from this to a brown sphere labeled T s joined by its right side to the left side of T u. The arrow is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of T s and loss of G D P. An arrow curves up from T s bonded to T U accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of G T P and a branched arrow showing the loss of T s. This yields T u bonded to G T P. An arrow points up from this structure joined by a curved line showing the addition of an incoming second aminoacyl-t R N A, which is similar to the first t R N A except that specific bases are not shown in its anticodon and it has a blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript instead of f Met. This yields an aminoacyl-t R N A that is similar but has a purple sphere labeled T u bonded to G T P attached to the upper right of the green part of the molecule adjacent to the blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript to its left. This produces the molecule at the upper left of the cycle that shows the binding of the second aminoacyl-t R N A into the A site. After the branch to the cycle that shows the addition of the second aminoacyl-t R N A, the arrow pointing down from the ribosome shown at the upper left of the cycle with the second aminoacyl-t R N A moving into position yields a similar molecule with the second aminoacyl-t R N A in the A site bound to the yellow piece of R N A below. The blue sphere labeled f Met bound is touching the blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript to its right.</p>

Cutouts in the bottom of the yellow piece and top of the orange piece meet to form an opening divided into three parts. The left-hand part is labeled, E, the middle part contains t R N A bonded to a blue sphere labeled f M e t, and the right-hand part contains a similar t R N A bonded to a blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript. These two blue spheres are touching. Each t R N A consists of a yellow half-circle base with a flat bottom, a green vertical portion made up of a green strand, and a purple tip bonded to a blue sphere. A strand of m R N A runs beneath with its 5 prime end at the lower left of the orange piece. The strand runs up to run almost horizontally beneath the E side, then has a dark green piece reading A U G beneath U A C at the yellow anticodon at the bottom of the aminoacyl-t R N A above, then has a yellow portion beneath the yellow anticodon at the bottom of the a second amino acyl-t R N A above, then curves down out of the orange structure before running horizontally to end at its 3 prime end. An arrow labeled peptide bond formation points right so show a similar structure in which the blue sphere labeled A A subscript a end subscript of the second aminoacyl t-R N A is bound to the blue sphere labeled f M e t that had been bound to the left-hand aminoacyl-t R N A. The f M e t sphere is above the A A subscript 2 end subscript sphere. The purple pieces at the tops of each t RN A have bent to the left and curved arrows show their motion to the left. A close-up showing the two blue spheres prior to peptide bond formation shows the top of a green sphere labeled P site on the left with a yellow vertical cylindrical region above it. A vertical purple rounded bar extends from the green P site and contains three dashed lines that lead up to O bonded to C H 2 to the left bonded to the left vertex above of a five-membered sugar ring with O at its bottom vertex. The ring has a right-side vertex bonded to C H 3 below, an upper right vertex bonded to O H, and an upper left vertex bonded to O within a blue sphere labeled f M e t. This O is bonded to C above that is double bonded to O above and bonded to C to the left bonded to R superscript 1 end superscript above, H below, and N to the left further bonded to H below and to C above double bonded to O to the left and bonded to H above. To the right, a similar purple piece labeled A site rises vertically and then bends horizontally to the left. It contains a similar sugar with its upper left vertex bonded to O at the lower right of the blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript. This O is bonded to C above double bonded to O above and bonded to C to the left bonded to R superscript 2 above, bonded to H below, and bonded to N to the left with a red pair of electrons and bonded to H above and below. Arrows point from the red pair of electrons on N to the right-hand C of f M e t and a second arrow points from the double bond between the same right-hand C of f M e t and O above to the same O. An arrow points to the right to show a similar structure in which N of A A subscript 2 end subscript has a positive charge and is bonded to the right-hand C of f M e t, which is bonded to O minus above, Red arrows point from the negative charge on this O minus to the bond between it and C below, from the bond between the same C and O below to H bonded to O bonded to the upper right vertex of the guar ring, from the bond between this H and O bonded to the upper right vertex of the sugar ring and H bonded to N plus below in A A subscript 2, and from the bond between the same H and N plus to N plus. This yields a structure in an arrow shows that the purple piece that had been bound to f M e t has moved from the P site into the E site and now has a horizontal top that bonds to the left. An arrow shows that the right-hand purple piece has moved from the A site into the P side and now has two blue spheres extending up into the cylindrical opening above. The sugar ring in this right-hand purple piece has an upper left vertex bonded to O in the blue sphere labeled A A subscript 2 end subscript that is further bonded to C to the right double bonded to O to the right and bonded to C above bonded to H to the left, R superscript 2 end superscript tot eh right, and N above bonded to H to the right and to C in the blue sphere labeled f M e t above. This bottom C in f M e t is double bonded to O to the right and bonded to C above bonded to R superscript 1 end superscript to the right, H to the left, and N above bonded to H to the left and to C to the right double bonded to O above and bonded to H to the right.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_y2EEqmcpJW">Ribosomes may stall during protein biosynthesis, especially while translating an mRNA that is damaged or incomplete. If translation cannot proceed to the end of the gene, the termination factors cannot act, and the ribosome may become “stuck” and thus inactivated.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_9vxtvxDD9Y">Translation can experience a variety of stalling events. One well-documented issue involves the addition of proline to the growing chain, particularly when two prolines must be added sequentially. Unlike the other amino acids, proline is a secondary amine and is not as good a nucleophile in the peptide bond formation step (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Mueze3UDDG" id="dav_9781319322342_kKvp8SYi0S">Fig. 27-29</a>). The constrained geometry of the proline side chain can also affect alignment of groups for reaction on the ribosome, an issue particularly acute when the peptide bond is to be between two prolines. Bacteria have an elongation factor P (EFP) that binds between the E and P sites on the ribosome next to the peptidyl-tRNA. EFP binding affects the positioning of adjacent bound tRNAs and facilitates an optimal alignment for peptide bond formation with proline. Ribosomes in cells lacking EFP stall regularly at locations where two or more proline codons must be read consecutively. In eukaryotes, a factor closely related to EFP, eIF5A, performs this same function.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_WexlCxw2hU">When the ribosome encounters the end of an mRNA before encountering a stop codon, the translocation step leads to formation of a stable <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_qSp0gCMvAA">non-stop complex</strong>, in which the A site has no mRNA that can interact with a new charged tRNA.

In virtually all bacteria, the rescue system consists of <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_AbVP72U5J5">transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)</strong> and <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_G2iZg6lYAN">small protein B (SmpB)</strong>. These bind to the stalled complex in such a way that the tmRNA is positioned in the empty A site so that the ribosome can continue translation until it encounters a stop codon embedded in the tmRNA. The ribosome is then recycled, and both the defective mRNA and the polypeptide translated from it are degraded. Similar systems exist in eukaryotes.</p>

Cutouts in the bottom of the yellow piece and top of the orange piece meet to form an opening divided into three parts. The left-hand part contains a t R N A with no amino acid attached, the middle part contains a t R N A bonded to a vertical chain of three blue spheres, and the right-hand part is empty and labeled A. A green strand begins at its 5 prime end to the lower right, has two parallel diagonal lines to show a cutout region, and then bends upward to curve beneath the bottoms of the two t R N As before ending before the A opening. A line pointing to the right-hand end of this green line reads, 3 prime end lacking stop codon. The ribosome is labeled, Stalled ribosome (non-stop complex). An arrow points down to show a similar structure in which an orange vertical structure resembling green t R N A but thicker is in the A site with a purple sphere labeled T u at its top bonded to G T P and a purple piece to its upper right bonded to a bright blue sphere labeled A l a. An orange strand extends down from this to the lower right, then runs horizontally to end just past a red stop region just before the orange 3 prime end. The same orange structure, labeled t m R N A, is shown in close-up to the upper right with an arrow pointing to the version in the A site. An adjacent gray box contains text reading, Transfer-messenger R N A (t m R N A) has a 5 prime end that mimics t R N A structure, and a 3 prime end that acts as a continuation of the m R N A. An arrow points down accompanied by a branched arrow showing the low of T u bonded to G T P. This yields a similar structure in which the orange structure in the A site is no longer bonded to T u and has a purple tip that has bent to the left so the bright blue sphere labeled A l a is adjacent to the vertical chain of blue spheres to its left. A gray box to the right reads, transpeptidation adds A l a to peptide chain). An arrow points down accompanied by a gray box containing text reading, Translocation and replacement of m R N A rescues stalled ribosome. This yields a similar molecule in which the left-hand t R N A has left and the central t R N A that had previously been bonded to a peptide chain is now in the left-hand E site with a purple end that is no longer bonded to any blue spheres. The orange t m R N A is now in the ventral site with its purple top bonded to bright blue A l a bonded to a chain of three blue spheres above. A yellow strand extending down from t m R N A is not bonded to the green m R N A to the left beneath the E site, but runs to the right as before. An arrow shows a new aminoacyl t R N A moving into the right-hand A site, where it binds to the orange strand running below. Arrows show this new amino acyl t R N A moving in and all of the other components moving to the left, ending with the departure of the t R N A that had been in the E site. An arrow points downward accompanied by text in a gray box reading, Translocation of m R N A reading frame continues to stop codon. This yields a ribosome with green t R N As in each site. The left-hand t R N A has a purple tip that is not bound to an amino acid. The central t R N A has a purple tip bound to a chain of two A A bound to the bright blue A l a bound to a further chain of 9 blue spheres. The right-hand t RN A has a purple tip bound to A A adjacent to A A bound to the middle t R N A. An orange strand runs beneath all three t R N As with a red piece labeled stop beneath the right-hand t R N A just before the 3 prime end and the left end running to the vertical structure that resembles t R N A and has a purple tip. Accompanying text in a grey box reads, Stop codon in t m R N A permits normal termination and ribosome recycling.

Improved fidelity might diminish speed, whereas increases in speed would probably compromise fidelity. And, recall that the proofreading mechanism on the ribosome establishes only that the proper codon-anticodon pairing has taken place, not that the correct amino acid is attached to the tRNA. If a tRNA is successfully aminoacylated with the wrong amino acid (as can be done experimentally), this incorrect amino acid is efficiently incorporated into a protein in response to whatever codon is normally recognized by the tRNA.</p>

Chains of spheres connected by a green strands run up and down from the D N A. An arrow points down to D N A just to the left of the first of these, which appears to be a single sphere. The chains of spheres are surrounded by red outlines and labeled polysomes. An arrow points from a red circle enclosing three of these chains to an illustration showing detail. Part b shows a blue strand of D N A that runs from left to right through three green R N A polymerases. As D N A passes through each R N A polymerase, it separates to form a transcription bubble and rejoins as a double strand slightly lower than the previous double strand. Gray arrows point to the right from each R N A polymerase to indicate the direction of transcription. In the center of each R N A polymerase, there is a triangle with a green strand beneath it that extends out through a narrow passage to the lower left. This strand runs downward through multiple ribosomes. Gray arrows point upward from the top ribosome of each set to indicate the direction of translation. The first R N A polymerase has a ribosome beneath it oriented so that the yellow half-circle is to the left with its flat side on the right against an orange, roughly rectangular half. Two aminoacyl-t R N A molecules are visible inside angled with their anticodons to the right and their purple tips to the left. The upper t R N A molecule has a single blue sphere at its tip and the lower t R N A has a chain of eight blue spheres at its top. There is a strand of green m R N A running beneath these ribosomes that continues out to the right, then bends back to the left through a second, similar ribosome, then bends to the right, then bends left through the orange 30 S part of a ribosome with its 50 S yellow part to the left. A single aminoacyl-t R N A is in the 30 S subunit. It has a single blue sphere. These separate yellow and orange subunits are labeled incoming ribosomal subunits. The central R N A polymerase has a similar set of ribosomes below but has three fully assembled ribosomes instead of two. The right-hand R N A polymerase has four fully assembled ribosomes. The structure including the R N A polymerase and top ribosome at the right is labeled expressome.</p>

Above, a purplish red helix attached to an upward-pointing beta strand is labeled folding intermediate delivered by H s p 70-A D P.

This yields a similar structure with A T P attached to each blue oval, with an arrow showing the departure of the clump of yellow spheres below, with no helix and beta strand visible in the red region, with a blue strand visible in the blue region bonded to a purplish-red helix to the upper right, and with an arrow showing the addition of a yellow clump of half-circles with a flat bottom labeled G r o E S to the top of the structure. Two arrows point away from this structure. A downward arrow points to a tan box showing a purplish red helix attached to a blue beta strand above text reading slow-folding intermediate. The word “or” separates this from the native protein, which has two helices and two beta strands. The second arrow from the top center structure points right accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of 7 gray ovals labeled A D P.

To the lower right, a purplish red helix attached to a blue beta strand with the arrow pointing down is shown and labeled folding intermediate delivered by H s p 70-A D P. An arrows shows that this is added to the structure at the lower right, resulting in two helices and beta sheets in its blue region.

Two arrows point away from this structure. The top arrow points up to the tan box comparing the helices and beta strands of slow-folding intermediate compared with native proteins. The second arrow points left accompanied by an arrow that branches off to show the loss of 7 gray ovals labeled A D P.

Except as noted otherwise, these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. The differences between bacterial and eukaryotic protein synthesis, though in some cases subtle, are such that most of the compounds discussed below are relatively harmless to eukaryotic cells. Natural selection has favored the evolution of compounds that exploit minor differences in order to affect bacterial systems selectively, so that these biochemical weapons are synthesized by some microorganisms and are extremely toxic to others. Because nearly every step in protein synthesis can be specifically inhibited by one antibiotic or another, antibiotics have become valuable tools in the study of protein biosynthesis.</p>

The bacterium <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_imaAHR3Ggv">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> releases the <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_rmNfpXn3nv">diphtheria toxin</dfn> <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_Qnx939edfw" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mtext>r</mtext></msub><mtext> </mtext><mn>58,330</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="left-parenthesis upper M Subscript r Baseline 58,330 right-parenthesis" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch27_03EQ_0129.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue of eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2, thereby inactivating it. The resulting dead cells form a thick, gray membrane that covers the throat and tonsils, creating a putrid odor that is one hallmark of the disease. <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_3GDj0ujw3u">Ricin</dfn> <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_WUA0r4XJvO" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mtext>r</mtext></msub><mtext> </mtext><mn>29,895</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="left-parenthesis upper M Subscript r Baseline 29,895 right-parenthesis" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch27_03EQ_0130.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>, an extremely toxic protein of the castor bean, inactivates the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes by depurinating a specific adenosine residue in 28S rRNA. Ricin was used in the infamous 1978 murder of BBC journalist and Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, presumably by the Bulgarian secret police. Using a syringe hidden at the end of an umbrella, a member of the secret police injected Markov in the leg with a ricin-infused pellet. He died four days later. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_XnPrOuoA67" role="presentation" src="../images/square4.png"/></p>

Bacteria have 70S ribosomes, with a large (50S) and a small (30S) subunit. Eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger (80S) and contain more proteins. The growth of polypeptides on ribosomes begins with the amino-terminal amino acid and proceeds by successive additions of new residues to the carboxyl-terminal end.</li>

In the elongation steps, GTP and elongation factors are required for binding the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site on the ribosome. In the first peptidyl transfer reaction, the fMet residue is transferred to the amino group of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA. Movement of the ribosome along the mRNA then translocates the dipeptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site, a process requiring hydrolysis of GTP. Deacylated tRNAs dissociate from the ribosomal E site.</li>

After many such elongation cycles, synthesis of the polypeptide is terminated with the aid of release factors. At least four high-energy phosphate equivalents (from ATP and GTP) are required to generate each peptide bond, an energy investment required to guarantee fidelity of translation.</li>
