Nitrogen enters these biosynthetic pathways by way of glutamate and glutamine. Some pathways are simple, others are not. Ten of the amino acids are just one or several steps removed from the common metabolite from which they are derived. The biosynthetic pathways for others, such as the aromatic amino acids, are more complex.</p>

The label is somewhat misleading, however, because innate biosynthetic pathways often do not provide enough of these amino acids to support optimal growth and health. The remaining amino acids, the <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_U6AX8OCRTC">essential amino acids</dfn>, cannot be synthesized by most mammals and must be obtained from food.

This yields valine, shown as a light red box containing H 3 C bonded to C bonded to H below, bonded to C H 3 above outside of the box, and bonded to C to the right outside of the box further bonded to H below, to C O O minus to the right, and to N H 3 above in a green box with a positive charge on N. To the right, a vertical downward arrow points from alpha-ketoisovalerate produced from pyruvate to a box labeled leucine. The top of the arrow pointing down from alpha-ketoisovalerate is labeled 4 steps. From top to bottom, molecules are added and lost. A blue box labeled acetyl bonded to Co A outside of the box on the left has an arrow pointing across the vertical arrow to Co A on the right. Below, N A D plus on the left has an arrow pointing across the vertical arrow to an orange oval labeled N A D H plus H plus on the right. Below, an arrow branches off to show the loss of C O 2. Below, an arrow points from a green box labeled glutamate on the left to alpha-ketoglutarate on the right. This yields a box labeled leucine. Leucine is shown as a light red box containing H 3 C bonded to C bonded to H below, bonded to C H 3 above outside of the box, and bonded to C to the right outside of the box further bonded to H above and below and to C on the right in a blue box that is bonded to H below and to C O O minus within the same box and to N H 3 above in a green box with a positive charge on N.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_WftfRhCf1G">The three amino acid side chains that contain aromatic rings, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, present a special chemical problem for biosynthesis. Aromatic rings are not readily available in the environment, even though the benzene ring is very stable. The branched pathway to tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, occurring in bacteria, fungi, and plants, is the main biological route of aromatic ring formation. It proceeds through ring closure of an aliphatic precursor followed by stepwise addition of double bonds. The first four steps produce shikimate, a seven-carbon molecule derived from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_hKn4B05rrK"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_1RkX4IBycb" id="dav_9781319322342_RlhHvGHroX">Fig. 22-18</a></strong>). Shikimate is converted to chorismate in three steps that include the addition of three more carbons from another molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismate is the first branch point of the pathway, with one branch leading to tryptophan, the other to phenylalanine and tyrosine.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_d5po8SLtiN">The legend is as follows: 1 equals 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase; 2 equals dehydroquinate synthase; 3 equals 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase; 4 equals shikimate dehydrogenase; 5 equals shikimate kinase; 6 equals 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase; and 7 equals chorismate synthase. The reaction begins with the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate (P E P) and erythrose 4-phosphate. Phosphoenolpyruvate has a central C that is bonded to O to the upper left and further bonded to a circle labeled P, double bonded to C H 2 below, and bonded to C O O minus to the upper right. The carbon chain is highlighted in light red. Erythrose 4-phosphate is a vertical four-carbon chain with C 1 double bonded to O to the upper left and bonded to H to the upper right, C 2 bonded to H on the left and O H on the right, C 3 bonded to H on the left and O H on the right, and C 4 bonded to 2 H and to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. The carbon chain is highlighted in blue. Arrow 1 points downward accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of P subscript 1 end subscript. This yields 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phospahte, shown as a seven-carbon chain with C 2 double bonded to O to the upper left and bonded to C O O minus to the upper right, C 3 bonded to 2 H, C 4 bonded to O H on the left and H on the right, C 5 bonded to H on the left and O H on the right, C 6 bonded to H on the left and O H on the right, and C 7 bonded to 2 H and to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. C 1 through C 3 at the top are highlighted in red and C 4 through C 7 at the bottom are highlighted in blue. An arrow labeled 2 points down with N A D plus to the upper right and an arrow branching off below showing the loss of P subscript i end subscript. This yields 3-dehydroquinate, which is a six-membered ring. The top vertex contains C hashed wedge bonded to O H to the upper left and bonded to C O O minus to the upper right. The lower right vertex is solid wedge bonded to O H and hashed wedge bonded to H, the bottom vertex is hashed wedge bonded to O H and solid wedge bonded to H, and the lower left vertex is double bonded to O. The carbon chain clockwise from the upper left vertex to the lower right vertex is highlighted in blue and the carbons at the upper right vertex and top vertex and bonded to the top vertex are highlighted in red. An arrow labeled 3 points down accompanied by an arrow branching off to show the loss of H 2 O. This yields 3-dehydroshikimate. It is similar to 3-dehydroquinate except that the top vertex is bonded to C O O mins and there is a double bond at the upper left side. The blue and red highlighting of the carbon chains is unchanged. Arrow 4 points down from 3-dehydroshikimate at the upper right and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H plus H plus and the loss of N A D plus. This yields shikimate, which is similar to 3-dehydroshikimate except that the lower left vertex is hashed wedge bonded to O H and solid wedge bonded to H. The blue and red highlighting of the carbon chains is unchanged. Arrow 5 points down from shikimate and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and the loss of A D P. This yields shikimate 3-phosphate, which is similar to shikimate except that the lower left vertex is solid wedge bonded to H and hashed wedge bonded to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. The blue and red highlighting of the carbon chains is unchanged. Arrow 6 points down from shikimate 3-phosphate and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of a light red box labeled P E P and loss of P subscript i end subscript. This yields 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate, which has a similar structure to shikimate 3-phosphate except that the lower right vertex has a hashed wedge bond to H and a solid wedge bond to O further bonded to C in a light red box that is double bonded to C H 2 above and bonded to C O O minus to the right, all within the light red box. Arrow 7 points down from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of P subscript i end subscript. This yields chorismate, which has a similar structure except that the lower left vertex is no longer bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. From the upper left vertex, the carbon chain is highlighted in blue until the lower right vertex. The upper right vertex, top vertex, and carbon bonded to the top vertex are highlighted in light red. Additionally, O that is hashed wedge bonded to the lower right vertex is further bonded to C in a red highlighted box that is further double bonded to C H 2 above and bonded to C O O minus to the right, all of which are within the box.</p>

Chorismate at the top is a six-membered ring with double bonds at the left side and upper right side.

The top vertex is bonded to a chain above that is entirely highlighted in light red beginning with C H bonded to O H above and bonded to C H to the right that is bonded to O H above and to C H 2 to the right further bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. Arrow 1, labeled tryptophan synthase alpha subunits, points down from indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is shown highlighted in light red as C double bonded to O to the upper left, bonded to H to the lower left, and bonded to C H to the right bonded to O H above and to C H 2 to the right further bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. Accompanying text reads, An aldol cleavage produces indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; P L P is not required. This yields indole, which is shown in a vertical channel between two blue sides. Indole is a benzene ring that shares its eight side with the left side of a five-membered ring with N substituted for C at its lower right vertex in a green box and bonded to H in the same green box and with a red highlighted double bond at its upper right side. The right side and top vertices on either side of the double bond are highlighted. Accompanying text reads, Indole traverse tunnel between alpha and beta subunits. Arrow 2, labeled tryptophan synthase beta subunits, points down from indole to show an interaction between indole and other molecules within an opening between two beta subunits of the enzyme. A curved arrow accompanying arrow 2 shows the addition of serine and loss of H 2 O with P L P at the inflection point of the arrow. Serine is highlighted in blue and is C H 2 with a beta on C bonded to O H below and to C H to the right bonded to N H 3 above with a positive charge on N and to C O O Minus to the right. Accompanying text reads, dehydration of serine forms a P L P-aminoacrylate intermediate. The figure below the arrow shows an irregular opening that is roughly round but with wavy sides, a wide opening at the top, and a narrow opening at the lower left. The blue sides around this opening are each labeled beta. Text below reads, P L P-aminoacrylate adduct. Indole is shown at the upper left with its benzene ring projecting into an invagination in the left side wall. The top vertex is shown bonded to H and a red pair of electrons is shown on N. At the upper right, the blue boundary of the enzyme has a bond to B to the left in the opening. B has a red pair of electrons. Serine is highlighted in blue and oriented with a central C double bonded to C H 2 at the upper left with the C labeled as beta, to C O O minus to the upper right, and to N H below with a positive charge on N, which is double bonded to C H outside of the blue highlighting that is bonded to the top vertex of a six-membered ring with double bonds at its upper left, right, and lower left sides and with its upper right vertex bonded to O H, its lower right vertex bonded to C H 3, N plus substituted for C at its bottom vertex and bonded to H, and its upper left vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. Red arrows point from the red electrons on N in indole to the lower right side of its five-membered ring, from the red highlighted double bond at the upper right side of the five-membered ring of indole to the C labeled beta and highlighted in blue, from the double bond between the double bond between C labeled beta and the central C to its lower right and the bond between the same central C and N plus below, from the double bond between N H with a positive charge on N and the bond between C H bonded to the top vertex of the ring and the top vertex of the ring, between the double bond at the upper left side of the ring and the left side of the ring, and between the double bond at the lower left side of the ring and N H plus at the bottom vertex of the ring. Arrow 3 points down to show further interactions in the opening with text below reading, quinonoid intermediate. Accompanying text reads, Indole condenses with the aminoacrylate intermediate (2 steps). The blue region of enzyme at the upper left is gone and the right side is still labeled beta. B with a red pair of electrons is still bonded to the boundary of the enzyme at the upper right. The six-membered ring joined with a five-membered ring is angled downward with the benzene ring to the upper left and the five-membered ring lower down. The five-membered ring has a double bond at its bottom right side; an upper right vertex, upper right side bond, and lower right vertex highlighted in red; N plus at the bottom vertex and bonded to H within a green box; and an upper right vertex bonded to H above and to C H 2 in a blue box to the right further bonded to C bonded to C O O minus to the right and double bonded to N H to the lower right with a positive charge on N and a bond to C H to the lower left that is double bonded to the six-membered ring below that has double bonds at its left and right sides, an upper right vertex bonded to O H, a lower right vertex bonded to C H 3, N substituted for C at its bottom vertex with a red pair of electrons and bonded to H, and an upper left vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on B at the upper right to H bonded to the upper right vertex of the five-membered ring, from the bond between the same H and the upper right vertex of the ring to the upper right side of the same ring, from the double bond at the lower right side of the same ring to N plus at the bottom vertex of the same ring, from the pair of electrons on N H at the bottom of the six-membered ring to the lower left side of the same ring, from the double bond at the left side of the six-membered ring to the upper left side of the same ring, from the double bond from the top vertex of the six-membered ring to C H above to the bond between the same C H and N H with a positive charge on N above, and from the double bond between N H with a positive charge on N and the central C above to an individual H plus above. Arrow 4 points right to another illustration with text below reading, aldimine with tryptophan. The upper right boundary of the enzyme is bonded to B H within the opening. The five-membered ring joined with a six-membered ring has N at its bottom vertex bonded to H, both within the same green box, has a double bond at its right side, has a red highlighted chain from the lower right vertex to the upper right vertex, and has an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 in a blue box further bonded to C H bonded to C O O minus to the right and bonded to N H to the lower right with a positive charge on N, all within the blue box, that is double bonded to C H outside of the blue box bonded to the top vertex of a six-membered ring with double bonds at its upper left, right, and lower left sides, with an upper right vertex bonded to O H, with a lower right vertex bonded to C H 3, with N plus substituted for C at the bottom vertex and bonded to H, and with an upper left vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. Arrow 5 points right accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of a blue oval labeled enzyme bonded to P L P. Text below reads, Imine linkage joining tryptophan to P L P is hydrolyzed. This yields a six-membered ring with its lower right side shared with the upper left side of a five-membered ring with N substituted for C at its bottom vertex within a green box and bonded to H within the same box, with a double bond at its upper right side, with a red highlighted chain from the lower right to upper right vertex, and with an upper right vertex bonded to C H 2 in a blue box further bonded to C H bonded to N H 3 above with a positive charge on N and to C O O minus. Text below reads, tryptophan. Part b shows a blue half-oval cut off across the bottom and with irregular sizes beneath a white region that extends up almost vertically above it for a short distance. The blue region is labeled beta and the white region is labeled alpha. A rounded opening in the middle of the blue region contains a quinoid, shown as a wireframe ring with a blue vertex at the bottom, bonds from the upper and lower right vertex, a chain bonded to its upper left vertex, and a long chain extending from its top vertex labeled, from serine. A six-membered ring joined with a five-membered ring that has a blue vertex is labeled indole. The opening narrows and a thin region from this opening to a widening at the start of the blue region is labeled, tunnel. A slightly wider vertical region in the white part contains another indole molecule and then bends right slightly, where a wireframe model of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is visible as a vertical chain that branches at its right end.</p>

The lower left vertex is bonded to the chain below of C bonded to O H to the right, H to the left, and C below bonded to O H to the right, H to the left, and C H 2 below further bonded to a circle labeled P. An arrow labeled 6 points down to imidazole acetol 3-phosphate and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of H 2 O. The top part of the molecule with the ring is similar, but the lower left vertex of the ring is bonded to C H 2 bonded to C below that is double bonded to O to the right and bonded to C H 2 below further bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. Right- and left-pointing arrows labeled 7 are accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of a green box labeled glutamate and the loss of alpha-ketoglutarate. This yields L-histidinol phosphate, which is similar except that the lower left vertex of the chain is bonded to C H 2 below bonded to C H below bonded to N H 3 in a green box with a positive charge on N to the right and to C H 2 below further bonded to O bonded to a circle labeled P. An arrow labeled 8 points right with an arrow branching away to show the loss of P subscript i end subscript. This yields L-histidinol, which is similar except that the bottom carbon of the chain is now bonded to 2 H and O H instead of to O further bonded to a circle labeled P. An arrow labeled 9 points right to a box labeled histidine and is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of 2 N A D plus and loss of 2 N A D H plus 2 H plus. Histidine is similar to the reactant except that the bottom carbon now forms C O O minus instead of being bonded to 2 H and O H.</p>
