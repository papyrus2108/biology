Incorrectly repaired damage to one of the DNA strands has the same effect. Mutations in the DNA handed down to offspring — that is, mutations carried in the reproductive cells — may be harmful or even lethal to the new organism or cell; they may, for example, cause the synthesis of a defective enzyme that is not able to catalyze an essential metabolic reaction.

The mutant enzyme might have acquired a slightly different specificity, for example, so that it is now able to use some compound that the cell was previously unable to metabolize. If a population of cells were to find itself in an environment where that compound was the only or the most abundant available source of fuel, the mutant cell would have a selective advantage over the other, unmutated (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_UnZkyGOraO">wild-type</strong>) cells in the population. The mutant cell and its progeny would survive and prosper in the new environment, whereas wild-type cells would starve and be eliminated. This is what Charles Darwin meant by natural selection — what is sometimes summarized as “survival of the fittest.”</p>

Over many generations, as the DNA with two hexokinase genes is repeatedly duplicated, rare mistakes occur, leading to changes in the nucleotide sequence of the superfluous gene and thus of the protein that it encodes. In a few very rare cases, the altered protein produced from this mutant gene can bind a new substrate — galactose in our hypothetical case. The cell containing the mutant gene has acquired a new capability (metabolism of galactose), which may allow the cell to survive in an ecological niche that provides galactose but not glucose. If no gene duplication precedes mutation, the original function of the gene product is lost.</p>

The second copy is superfluous, and mutations in this gene will not be deleterious; it becomes a means by which the cell may evolve, by producing a new gene with a new function while retaining the original gene and gene function. Seen in this light, the DNA molecules of modern organisms are historical documents, records of the long journey from the earliest cells to modern organisms. The historical accounts in DNA are not complete, however; in the course of evolution, many mutations must have been erased or written over. But DNA molecules are the best source of biological history we have. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_06QnjeyU7d" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG02.png"/> The frequency of errors in DNA replication represents a balance between too many errors, which would yield nonviable daughter cells, and too few errors, which would prevent the genetic variation that allows survival of mutant cells in new ecological niches.</p>

The concentration of a self-replicating RNA molecule would increase exponentially, as one molecule formed several, several formed many, and so on. The fidelity of self-replication was presumably less than perfect, so the process would generate variants of the RNA, some of which might be even better able to self-replicate.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_KrEb1McqLs">The division of function between DNA (genetic information storage) and protein (catalysis) was, according to the “RNA world” hypothesis, a later development. New variants of self-replicating RNA molecules developed that had the additional ability to catalyze the condensation of amino acids into peptides. Occasionally, the peptide(s) thus formed would reinforce the self-replicating ability of the RNA, and the pair — RNA molecule and helping peptide — could undergo further modifications in sequence, generating increasingly efficient self-replicating systems. The remarkable discovery that in the protein-synthesizing machinery of modern cells (ribosomes), RNA molecules, not proteins, catalyze the formation of peptide bonds is consistent with the RNA world hypothesis.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_iBTedzL7yI">Some time after the evolution of this primitive protein-synthesizing system, there was a further development: DNA molecules with sequences complementary to the self-replicating RNA molecules took over the function of conserving the “genetic” information, and RNA molecules evolved to play roles in protein synthesis. (We explain in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_2gq4Esi0ce" id="dav_9781319322342_VjsWeoqmlj">Chapter 8</a> why DNA is a more stable molecule than RNA and thus a better repository of inheritable information.) Proteins proved to be versatile catalysts <span aria-label="33" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page33" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and, over time, took over most of that function. Lipidlike compounds in the primordial mixture formed relatively impermeable layers around self-replicating collections of molecules. The concentration of proteins and nucleic acids within these lipid enclosures favored the molecular interactions required in self-replication.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_RusukRoi3m">The RNA world scenario is intellectually satisfying, but it leaves unanswered a vexing question: where did the nucleotides needed to make the initial RNA molecules come from? An alternative to this scenario supposes that simple metabolic pathways evolved first, perhaps at the hot vents in the ocean floor. A set of linked chemical reactions there might have produced precursors, including nucleotides, before the advent of lipid membranes or RNA. Without more experimental evidence, neither of these hypotheses can be disproved.</p>

In 1996, scientists working in Greenland found chemical evidence of life (“fossil molecules”) from as far back as 3.85 billion years ago, forms of carbon embedded in rock that seem to have a distinctly biological origin. Somewhere on Earth during its first billion years the first simple organism arose, capable of replicating its own structure from a template (RNA?) that was the first genetic material. Because the terrestrial atmosphere at the dawn of life was nearly devoid of oxygen, and because there were few microorganisms to scavenge organic compounds formed by natural processes, these compounds were relatively stable. Given this stability and eons of time, the improbable became inevitable: lipid vesicles containing organic compounds and self-replicating RNA gave rise to the first cells, or protocells, and those protocells with the greatest capacity for self-replication became more numerous. The process of biological evolution had begun.</p>

First, as cells acquired more DNA, the mechanisms required to fold it compactly into discrete complexes with specific proteins and to divide it equally between daughter cells at cell division became more elaborate. Specialized proteins were required to stabilize folded DNA and to pull the resulting DNA-protein complexes (chromosomes) apart during cell division. This was the evolution of the chromosome. Second, as cells became larger, a system of intracellular membranes developed, including a double membrane surrounding the DNA. This membrane segregated the nuclear process of RNA synthesis on a DNA template from the cytoplasmic process of protein synthesis on ribosomes. This was the evolution of the nucleus, a defining feature of eukaryotes.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_x0glTmjVDs">At some later stage of evolution, unicellular organisms found it advantageous to cluster together, thereby acquiring greater motility, efficiency, or reproductive success than their free-living single-celled competitors. Further evolution of such clustered organisms led to permanent associations among individual cells and eventually to specialization within the colony — to cellular differentiation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_U0COhmgm8n">The advantages of cellular specialization led to the evolution of increasingly complex and highly differentiated organisms, in which some cells carried out the <span aria-label="35" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page35" role="doc-pagebreak"/>sensory functions; others the digestive, photosynthetic, or reproductive functions; and so forth. Many modern multicellular organisms contain hundreds of different cell types, each specialized for a function that supports the entire organism. Fundamental mechanisms that evolved early have been further refined and embellished through evolution. The same basic structures and mechanisms that underlie the beating motion of cilia in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_U2Tt0uTXhx">Paramecium</i> and of flagella in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_0trVmlGZJW">Chlamydomonas</i> are employed by the highly differentiated vertebrate sperm cell, for example.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_gRdMLXRLLJ">Now that genomes can be sequenced relatively quickly and inexpensively, biochemists have an enormously rich, ever-increasing treasury of information on the molecular anatomy of cells that they can use to analyze evolutionary relationships and refine evolutionary theory. Thus far, the molecular phylogeny derived from gene sequences is consistent with, but in many cases more precise than, the classical phylogeny based on macroscopic structures. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_tS5HHuDRBR" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG02.png"/> Although organisms have continuously diverged at the level of gross anatomy, at the molecular level the basic unity of life is readily apparent; molecular structures and mechanisms are remarkably similar from the simplest to the most complex organisms. These similarities are most easily seen at the level of sequences, either the DNA sequences that encode proteins or the protein sequences themselves.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eTDltPSFfQ">When two genes share readily detectable sequence similarities (nucleotide sequence in DNA or amino acid sequence in the proteins they encode), their sequences are said to be homologous and the proteins they encode are <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_iT8vt8sdXv">homologs</strong>. In the course of evolution, new structures, processes, or regulatory mechanisms are acquired, reflections of the changing genomes of the evolving organisms. The genome of a simple eukaryote such as yeast should have genes related to formation of the nuclear membrane, genes not present in bacteria or archaea. The genome of an insect should contain genes that encode proteins involved in specifying a characteristic segmented body plan, genes not present in yeast. The genomes of all vertebrate animals should share genes that specify the development of a spinal column, and those of mammals should have unique genes necessary for the development of the placenta, a characteristic of mammals — and so on. Comparisons of the whole genomes of species in each phylum are leading to the identification of genes critical to fundamental evolutionary changes in body plan and development.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_B0uGEihrQi">When the sequence of a genome is fully determined and each gene is assigned a function, molecular geneticists can group genes according to the processes (DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, generation of ATP, and so forth) in which they function and thus find what fraction of the genome is allocated to each of a cell’s activities. The largest category of genes in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_XmHHt1eXe7">E. coli</i>, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_UAU0rBZhlu">A. thaliana</i>, and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_0SSY5xX9G8">H. sapiens</i> consists of those of (as yet) unknown function, which make up more than 40% of the genes in each species. The genes encoding the transporters that move ions and small molecules across plasma membranes make up a significant proportion of the genes in all three species, more in the bacterium and plant than in the mammal (10% of the ~4,400 genes of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_fWba9SDYAz">E. coli</i>, ~8% of the ~27,000 genes of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_vWugOAG3OC">A. thaliana</i>, and ~4% of the ~20,000 genes of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_SAGVSF4jbw">H. sapiens</i>). Genes that encode the proteins and RNA required for protein synthesis make up 3% to 4% of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_DERGryZjr8">E. coli</i> genome; but in the more complex cells of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_yBglyDXbJ4">A. thaliana</i>, more genes are needed for targeting proteins to their final location in the cell than are needed to synthesize those proteins (about 6% and 2% of the genome, respectively). In general, the more complex the organism, the greater the proportion of its genome that encodes genes involved in the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_rtUDPePPR4">regulation</i> of cellular processes and the smaller the proportion dedicated to basic processes, or “housekeeping” functions, such as ATP generation and protein synthesis.

Typically, sequence differences are found in a number of different genes, each of which makes a partial contribution to the predisposition to a given condition or disease. Each of those genes codes for a protein that, in principle, might become the target for drugs to treat that condition. We may expect that for some genetic diseases, palliatives will be replaced by cures, and that for disease susceptibilities associated with particular genetic markers, forewarning and perhaps increased preventive measures will prevail. Today’s “medical history” may be replaced by a “medical forecast.” <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Bi4PRIGfM9" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>
