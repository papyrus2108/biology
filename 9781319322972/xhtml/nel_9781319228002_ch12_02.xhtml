Multicellular organisms have an additional level of specificity, because the receptors for a given signal, or the intracellular targets of a given signal pathway, are present only in certain cell types. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, for example, triggers responses in the cells of the anterior pituitary but not in hepatocytes, which lack receptors for this hormone. Epinephrine alters glycogen metabolism in hepatocytes but not in adipocytes; in this case, both cell types have receptors for the hormone, but whereas hepatocytes contain glycogen and the glycogen-metabolizing enzyme that is stimulated by epinephrine, adipocytes contain neither.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_EHBpMCepAr">Part a is labeled Specificity: Text reads, Signaling ligand fits binding site on its complementary receptor; other ligands do not fit. The image shows a rectangular receptor molecule with an irregular opening on its top side. A small irregular piece labeled L subscript 1 has an arrow pointing to the irregular opening, showing that it fits into the opening to complete the rectangle. A second small irregular piece labeled L subscript 2 has a different shape that does not fit into the opening in the rectangle and an arrow with a break in it pointing to the space. An arrow points down from the receptor to the word response. Part b is labeled Sensitivity: Text reads, Receptor has high affinity (low K subscript a) for signaling ligand (L). A similar rectangular piece is shown beneath an irregular piece labeled L that fits into an opening in its upper side. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that the two pieces fit together. The right-pointing arrow is longer than the left-pointing arrow. Part c is labeled Amplification: Text reads, When enzymes activate enzymes, the number of affected molecules increases geometrically in an enzyme cascade. An arrow points down from the word signal to a green circle enclosing a green triangle on top of a rectangle labeled enzyme 1. Three arrows point down from enzyme 1. The left-hand arrow points to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above a rectangle labeled enzyme 2, from which three arrows point down to three green circles enclosing green triangles above three squares labeled enzyme 3. The middle and right-hand arrows similarly point down to green circles enclosing green triangles above enzyme 2 rectangles that each have three arrows pointing down to three green circles enclosing green triangles above three squares labeled enzyme 3. Part d is labeled Modularity: Text reads, Proteins with multivalent affinities form diverse signaling complexes from interchangeable parts. Phosphorylation provides reversible points of interaction. An arrow points down from the word signal to a yellow circle with yellow circles connected by short lines to its upper left and upper right and by a shorter line to P in a circle below. P in a circle is within a circular opening in the top of an oval that has a short line down to P in a circle below within a circular opening in the top of a rectangle. An arrow points down to the word response. Part e is labeled Desensitization or Adaptation: Text reads, Receptor activation triggers a feedback circuit that shuts off the receptor or removes it from the cell surface. An arrow points down from the word signal to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above a rectangle labeled receptor. An arrow pointing down from the receptor splits so that one half indicates response below and the other circles around to a red circle with a red “X” on the left side of the receptor. Part f is labeled Integration: Text reads, When two signals have opposite effects on a metabolic characteristic such as the concentration of a second messenger X, or the membrane potential V subscript m, the regulatory outcome results from the integrated input from both receptors. Signal 1 on the left has an arrow pointing down to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above a rectangle labeled receptor 1. An arrow points down to text reading, upward arrow symbol [X] or upward arrow symbol V subscript m. Signal 2 on the right has an arrow pointing down to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above an oval labeled receptor 1. An arrow points down to text reading, downward arrow symbol [X] or downward arrow symbol V subscript m. Beneath the text showing changes in concentration in X or in V subscript m, there is a bracket labeled net Greek letter delta [X] or Greek letter delta V subscript m with an arrow pointing down to the word response. Part g is labeled Divergence: Text reads, When a receptor is activated by a signal, it activates two or more pathways with different end effects. An arrow points down from the word signal to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above a rectangle labeled receptor with two arrows pointing down from it, one to the lower left and one to the lower right. The left-hand arrow points to pathway 1, from which an arrow points down to response 1. The right-hand arrow points down to pathway 2, from which an arrow points down to response 2. Part h is labeled Localized response: Text reads, When the enzyme that destroys an intracellular message is clustered with the message producer, the message is degraded before it can diffuse to distant points, so the response is only local and brief. An arrow points down from the word signal to a green circle enclosing a green triangle above a rectangle labeled receptor. A horizontal line runs through the center of the receptor and through the center of an oval to its right labeled message remover. An arrow points down from receptor and then bends right to the word message. A curved arrow runs from the word message up to the bottom of the message removal oval, then down to the word message with a red “X” across it. Text below reads, response (local).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_VlSItMWAVF">A plasma membrane extends horizontally from left to right. Text above the left side of the membrane reads, 1. G protein-coupled receptor. External ligand (L) binding to receptor (R) activates an intracellular G T P-binding protein (G), which regulates an enzyme (E n z) that generates an intracellular second messenger (X). Beneath this text, an irregular vertical rectangle labeled R extends across the plasma membrane. Right- and left-pointing arrows with a circle labeled L above show that the rectangle reversibly binds to the circle L and joins to a small, irregular protrusion at the upper left of an oval labeled G within the cell. An arrow points right to show a roughly rectangular structure labeled E n z with the top half divided into two halves and attached to the oval labeled G to the lower left with short radiating lines extending out around both the rectangle and oval and with an arrow pointing down to X within the cell. Text above the middle of the membrane reads, 2 a. Receptor enzyme (tyrosine kinase). Ligand binding activates tyrosine kinase activity by autophosphorylation. Beneath this text, two narrow vertical strands run parallel through the membrane. Each bends away from the other beneath the membrane, where it has an irregular rounded piece attached within the cell. Each also has a thicker irregular piece above the membrane that bends toward the thicker irregular piece of the other half, causing them to join together to form a rounded horizontal piece connecting the two halves. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that a circle labeled L comes in and binds reversibly to the right side of the curved horizontal piece on top, causing the two halves to change shape and move apart to look more like a letter “T”. On the bottom, the irregular rounded pieces cross over so that the right-hand one is on the left and the left-hand one is on the right. They are close together and surrounded by short radiating lines. An arrow points down to text reading, kinase cascade. Text adjacent to the words kinase cascade reads, 2 b. Kinase activates transcription factor (T), altering gene expression. An arrow points down from the words kinase cascade to a circle labeled T that has an arrow that runs through the nuclear envelope to point to a similar circle labeled T attached to the left side of a double helix of D N A. To the right of the circle labeled T, a short vertical line runs up from the D N A and bends to point to the right, where a wavy arrow to the right is labeled m R N A. A curved upward arrow from the m R N A points to protein. Text above the right side of the membrane reads, 3. Gated ion channel. Channel opens or closes in response to concentration of signal ligand or membrane potential. A long rectangular channel has long rounded rectangles on each side that bend away from the center at each end. The upper left side has a concavity beneath a circle labeled L. Right- and left-pointing arrows show that the circle labeled L reversibly binds to the upper left side of the channel, causing the two sides to move apart. The word ion above the membrane has an arrow pointing through the channel to show movement into the cell. Beneath the nuclear envelope at the bottom center of the illustration, text reads, 4. Nuclear receptor. Hormone binding allows the receptor to regulate the expression of specific genes. A circle labeled L above the plasma membrane has a dotted arrow pointing to an oval containing a circle labeled L bound to the top of a double helix of D N A. To the right of the oval, a short vertical line runs up from the D N A and bends to point to the right, where a wavy arrow to the right is labeled m R N A. A curved upward arrow from the m R N A points to protein.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tanc55jSTK">As we begin this discussion of biological signaling, a word about the nomenclature of signaling proteins is in order. These proteins are typically discovered in one context and named accordingly, then prove to be involved in <span aria-label="412" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page412" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a broader range of biological functions for which the original name is not helpful. For example, the retinoblastoma protein, pRb, was initially identified as the product of a mutation that contributes to cancer of the retina (retinoblastoma), but it is now known to function in many pathways essential to cell division in all cells, not just those of the retina. Some genes and proteins are given noncommittal names: the tumor suppressor protein p53, for example, is a <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_2oQHqpK7fX">p</i>rotein of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ebivRbzBtf">53</i> kDa, but its name gives no clue to its great importance in the regulation of cell division and the development of cancer. In this chapter we generally define these protein names as we encounter them, introducing the names that are commonly used by researchers in the field.</p>
