<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_oc2t0FoMn6">Cholesterol is doubtless the most publicized lipid, notorious because of the strong correlation between high levels of cholesterol in the blood and the incidence of human cardiovascular diseases. Less well advertised is cholesterol’s crucial role as a component of cellular <span aria-label="772" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page772" role="doc-pagebreak"/>membranes and as a precursor of steroid hormones and bile acids. Cholesterol is an essential molecule in many animals, including humans, but is not required in the mammalian diet — all cells can synthesize it from simple precursors.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_huidzUZUpG">We begin with an account of the main steps in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate, and then discuss the transport of cholesterol in the blood, its uptake by cells, the normal regulation of cholesterol synthesis, and its regulation in those with defects in cholesterol uptake or transport. We next consider other cellular components derived from cholesterol, such as bile acids and steroid hormones. Finally, an outline of the biosynthetic pathways to some of the many compounds derived from isoprene units, which share early steps with the pathway to cholesterol, illustrates the extraordinary versatility of isoprenoid condensations in biosynthesis.</p>

At the lower left side, there is a partial ring with six sides that has a lower right side that does not meet the lower right vertex to close the ring. The bottom vertex has a bond to the upper right that does not meet the adjacent vertex, a bond to the lower left, and a double bond to the upper left that resembles the lower left side of a ring. The lower right side of the partial ring has a double bond and the upper right vertex is bonded to C H 3. The lower right vertex of the partial ring connects to a bond that resembles the lower right side of a six-membered ring that shares its left side double bond with the right side double bond of the previous partial ring. The methyl group bonded to the upper right vertex of the left-hand ring extends across the upper left but does not reach the top vertex to close the ring. The upper right side has a double bond and the upper right vertex is bonded to C H 3 to the lower right. A third partial six-membered ring shares a double bond at its lower left side with the upper right side of the second ring. This partial ring has a double bond on its right side. Its lower right vertex has a bond to the right that forms the bottom of a partial five-membered ring and a bond to the lower right, but there is no lower right side bond. The right side double bond of this third ring resembles the left side of a five-membered ring to the right missing its upper left side. The upper right side of the partial five-membered ring resembles the lower left side of a partial six-membered ring above that has a double bond at its left side, an upper left vertex bonded to C H 3 and no right or lower right sides. The upper right vertex is bonded to C H to the upper right double bonded to C to the lower right bonded to 2 C H 3. An arrow labeled squalene monooxygenase points down to squalene 2,3-epoxide and is accompanied by two curved arrows. The outer curved arrows shows the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H plus H plus and loss of N A D P plus. The inner curved arrow shows the addition of O 2 and loss of H 2 O. This yields squalene 2,3-epoxide, which is similar to squalene except that the double bond at the lower left side of the left-hand ring is gone and the bottom vertex and lower left vertex are both bonded to the same O to the lower left, forming a triangular shape. The bottom vertex is numbered two and the lower left vertex is numbered 3. Three arrows point down. The left-hand arrow is labeled multistep (plants) and yields stigmasterol. This molecule has the standard four-ring structure of steroids with C 3 bonded to O H, a double bond between C 5 and C 6, C 10 bonded to C H 3, C 13 bonded to C H 3, and C 17 bonded to C H above bonded to C H 3 to the left and bonded to C H to the right double bonded to C H bonded to C H bonded to C H to the right further bonded to 2 C H 3 and to C 2 H 5 below. The center arrow from squalene 2,3-epoxide is labeled cyclase (animals). Red arrows point from the double bond extending up from the partial five-membered ring to the upper right vertex of the third partial six-membered ring, from the adjacent double bond at the lower right side of the third partial six-membered ring to the bottom vertex of the same ring, from the adjacent double bond at the lower left side of the third ring and upper right side of the second ring to the upper left vertex of the second ring, from the adjacent double bond at the left side of the second ring and right side of the first ring to the bottom vertex of the first ring, and from the bond between C 2 and O of the triangular ring, which is now highlighted in red, to H plus below. An arrow labeled cyclase points down to show lanosterol, which has the standard four-ring structure of a steroid with C 3 bonded to O H, C 4 bonded to 2 C H 3, C 10 bonded to C H 3, a double bond between C 8 and C 9, C 13 and C 14 each bonded to C H 3, and C 17 bonded to C H bonded to C H 3 to the left and to a chain to the right of C H 2 C H 2 C H double bonded to C bonded to 2 C H 3. An arrow labeled multistep points down to cholesterol, which has a similar structure except that C 4 is not bonded to methyl groups, there is a double bond between C 5 and C 6, there is no double bond between C 8 and C 9, C 14 is not bonded to a methyl group, and C 17 is bonded to C H bonded to C H 3 to the left and to a chain to the right of C H 2 C H 2 C H 2 bonded to C bonded to H and 2 C H 3. The right-hand arrow from squalene 2,3-epoxide is labeled multistep (fungi) and yields ergosterol. This structure has only three rings. It has a six-membered ring at the lower right with its lower left vertex bonded to O H, an upper right vertex bonded to C H 3 and to the lower left vertex of a second six-membered ring that shares its right side with the left side of a five-membered ring and has an upper right vertex shared with the five-membered ring that is bonded to C H 3. The top vertex of the five-membered ring is bonded to C H bonded to C H 3 to the left and bonded to C H to the right double bonded to C H bonded to C H bonded to C H 3 above and to C H to the right bonded to 2 C H 3.</p>

Bile also contains much smaller amounts of cholesterol (biliary cholesterol). Bile helps remove excess cholesterol from the intestine and facilitates excretion. Dietary fiber can enhance this effect by binding to bile and interfering with bile reabsorption in the intestines, leading to increased bile excretion in the feces. More cholesterol is then used to make bile. The soluble fiber available in oats (oatmeal) and barley is especially effective.</p>

A large orange oblong protrusion is labeled A p o B – 48, a small purple protrusion is labeled A p o C – Roman numeral 3, a long green oval protrusion is labeled A p o C – Roman numeral 2, a small yellow sphere is labeled A p o E, and a medium-sized purple oval at the bottom center is labeled A p o A – Roman numeral 4. A close-up of the interior shows many yellow strands labeled triacylglycerols with small light blue ovals in between them. A membrane is shown to the right with a horizontal layer of blue phospholipid heads that each have two tails extending to the left. Two orange roughly bar-shaped objects embedded between the phospholipid heads are labeled free (unesterified) cholesterol. Part b shows a low-density lipoprotein (L D L). It has a yellowish interior labeled triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. It has a blue outer surface. A large, green knobby projection above is labeled A p o B – 100 and smaller pieces of the same material are visible to the sides and beneath. The blue outer boundary is labeled phospholipid monolayer. A close-up of the interior shows that is similar to the chylomicron except that there are many orange rods inside and these are labeled cholesteryl esters. Part c shows four micrographs. The upper left micrograph is labeled chylomicrons (times 60,000) and shows a large, rough sphere surrounded by smaller spheres against a black background. The upper right micrograph is labeled V L D L (times 180,000) and shows smaller, less grainy spheres.

Numbered steps are described in the text. In the exogenous pathway (blue arrows), dietary lipids are packaged into chylomicrons; fatty acids from triacylglycerol (TAG) are released by lipoprotein lipase to adipose and muscle tissues, during transport through capillaries. Chylomicron remnants (containing largely protein and cholesterol) are taken up by the liver. Bile salts produced in the liver aid in dispersing dietary fats and are then reabsorbed in the enterohepatic pathway (green arrows). In the endogenous pathway (red arrows), lipids synthesized or packaged in the liver are delivered to peripheral tissues by VLDL. Extraction of lipid from VLDL (along with loss of some apolipoproteins) gradually converts some of it to LDL, which delivers cholesterol to extrahepatic tissues or returns to the liver. Excess cholesterol in extrahepatic tissues is transported back to the liver as HDL in reverse cholesterol transport (purple arrows). C represents cholesterol; CE, cholesteryl ester.</p>

The stomach is shown with dietary fat visible inside as a clump of yellow spheres. Small yellow spheres spread out in the intestine as it moves past the gall bladder. The liver is shown above. A clockwise circle of green arrows goes from the gallbladder, into the intestine, to bile salts in the liver, and back to the gallbladder. The number 14 is within the green circle of arrows and green text above reads, enterohepatic pathway. A close-up of the intestine below shows many structures that each have a blue sphere with a yellow tail attached. Three structures have blue ovals on top with three tails extending down and these are labeled T A G. The cells in the walls of the intestine are labeled enterocytes. A green crescent labeled A p o C – Roman numeral 2 is shown in the intestine wall. Blue arrows point through length of the intestine and come together across the A p o C Roman numeral 2 and A T A G to form a chylomicron. Text below reads, chylomicron (via lymphatic system). This structure is a blue circle with a yellow wedge visible on the right side with four T A G s inside, a large tan oblong labeled A p o B – 48 at the upper left, three small purplish ovals on its surface, a green oval on its surface, a slightly larger yellow oblong on the lower right side labeled A p o E, and a large purple oval at the bottom. A blue arrow points from the chylomicron into a capillary shown at the lower right. One arrow points to a white circle on the capillary labeled F F A. The capillary contains many small structures inside that each have a blue sphere attached to a yellow tail. A chylomicron remnant is visible as a tan rounded structure with a larger blue base with a small green crescent and a small yellow oval along it. A blue arrow from the chylomicron points to a chylomicron remnant above the capillary labeled chylomicron remnant from which a blue arrow points up to C in the liver from which black arrows point left to the enterohepatic pathway and right to C E, from which an arrow points to V L D L, from which a red arrow points to V L D L outside of the liver, from which a red arrow points into a capillary to I D L, from which a red arrow points up to F F A with a white circle to the left and another red arrow points right to L D L along the endogenous pathway back to the L D L receptor. An arrow points up from L D L to an irregular white cell labeled C and macrophages, foam cells next to the number 11. A purple arrow points from the foam cell to a purple series of arrows around 11 labeled reverse cholesterol transport. An arrow runs horizontally and separates into a dashed arrow numbered 13 that points down to join a red arrow to an L D L receptor and a solid arrow that curves down to reach an S R – B I receptor next tot eh number 12. This receptor is a T-shaped structure projecting from the liver and an arrow points from it to C below. A red arrow points from the similarly-shaped L D L receptor to its right to the same letter C. An arrow points down from C to C below, which can start the pathways to the right or left again, and a purple arrow points from C back out to the liver to H D L labeled 10 and then back up to the right toward the macrophage foam cell along the loop of purple arrows. Within the capillary that contains L D L, three arrows point down to C and then additional red arrows point down to three body structures. The first arrow points to adrenal glands, gonads; the second arrow points to muscle; and the third arrow points to adipose tissue. From the bottom capillary, blue arrows point up to a mammary gland illustrated with a breast, muscle illustrated with a piece of skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue shown as a long clump of yellow spheres.</p>

Adipocytes take up these fatty acids, reconvert them to triacylglycerols, and store the products in intracellular lipid droplets; myocytes, in contrast, primarily oxidize the fatty acids to supply energy. When the insulin level is high (after a meal), VLDL serves primarily to convey lipids from the diet to adipose tissue for storage. In the fasting state between meals, the fatty acids used to produce VLDL in the liver originate primarily from adipose tissue, and the principal VLDL target is myocytes of the heart and skeletal muscle.</p>

Instead, when HDL binds to SR-BI receptors in the plasma membranes of hepatocytes or steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland, these receptors mediate partial and selective transfer of cholesterol and other lipids in HDL into the cell. Depleted HDL then dissociates to recirculate in the bloodstream and extract more lipids from remnants of chylomicrons and VLDL, and from cells overloaded with cholesterol, as described below.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Ul45kKcyLz">Cholesterol synthesis is a complex and energy-expensive process. Excess cholesterol cannot be catabolized for use as fuel and must be excreted. Therefore, it is clearly advantageous to an organism to regulate the biosynthesis of cholesterol to complement dietary intake. In mammals, cholesterol production is regulated by intracellular cholesterol concentration, by the supply of ATP, and by the hormones glucagon and insulin. The committed step in the pathway to cholesterol (and a major site of regulation) is the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_TlX3Df9psw" id="dav_9781319322342_9RBZY5Arlv">Fig. 21-34</a>), the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase.</p>

Thus, when ATP levels drop, the synthesis of cholesterol slows, and catabolic pathways for the generation of ATP are stimulated (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_El811YsC4w"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_5YJ6XTlQHC" id="dav_9781319322342_Ezc4mUW9im">Fig. 21-43</a></strong>). Hormones that mediate global regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism also act on HMG-CoA reductase; glucagon stimulates its phosphorylation (inactivation), and insulin promotes dephosphorylation, activating the enzyme and favoring cholesterol synthesis. These covalent regulatory mechanisms are probably not as important, quantitatively, as the mechanisms that affect the synthesis and degradation of the enzyme.</p>

There, two proteolytic cleavages of SREBP release a regulatory fragment, which enters the nucleus and activates transcription of its target genes, including those for HMG-CoA reductase, the LDL receptor protein, and other proteins needed for lipid synthesis. When sterol levels increase sufficiently, the proteolytic release of SREBP amino-terminal domains is again blocked, and proteasome degradation of the existing active domains results in rapid shutdown of the gene targets.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_07qSZOx7aR">Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries. The coronary arteries that bring blood to the heart become narrowed due to the formation of fatty deposits called atherosclerotic plaques, containing cholesterol, fibrous proteins, calcium deposits, blood platelets, and cell debris. Developing the link between artery occlusion (atherosclerosis) and blood cholesterol levels was a project of the twentieth century, triggering a dispute that was resolved only with the development of effective cholesterol-lowering drugs. The Framingham Heart Study, a longitudinal study begun in 1948 and continuing today, was aimed at identifying factors correlated with cardiovascular disease. About 5,000 participants from the city of Framingham, Massachusetts, underwent periodic physical examinations and lifestyle interviews. By 2002, participants of the third generation were included in the study. This monumental study led to the identification of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_exyWcOF80V">In 1913, N. N. Anitschkov, an experimental pathologist in Saint Petersburg, Russia, published a study showing that rabbits fed a diet rich in cholesterol developed lesions very similar to the atherosclerotic plaques seen in aging humans. Anitschkov continued his work over the next few decades, publishing it in prominent western journals. Nevertheless, the work was not accepted as a model for human atherosclerosis, due to a prevailing view that the disease was simply a consequence of aging and could not be prevented. The link between serum cholesterol and atherosclerosis (the lipid hypothesis) was gradually strengthened, however, until researchers in the 1960s openly suggested that therapeutic intervention might be helpful. Controversy persisted until the results of a large study of cholesterol lowering, sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was published in 1984: the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial. This study conclusively showed a statistically significant decrease in heart attacks and strokes as a result of decreasing blood cholesterol level. The study made use of a bile acid–binding resin, cholestyramine, to control cholesterol. The results triggered a search for more effective therapeutic interventions. Some controversy persisted until development of the statins in the late 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_MTS0cTJd4a">Dr. Akira Endo, working at the Sankyo company in Tokyo, discovered the first statin and reported the work in 1976. Endo had been interested in cholesterol metabolism for some time, and he speculated in 1971 that the fungi being screened at that time for new antibiotics might also contain an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Over a period of several years, he screened more than 6,000 fungal cultures until a positive result emerged. The compound that resulted was named compactin (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_4vkk2lfK7L" id="dav_9781319322342_Qlbr3Yhcru">Fig. 1</a>). This compound eventually proved effective in reducing cholesterol levels in dogs and monkeys, and the work came to the attention of Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein at the University of Texas–Southwestern Medical School. Brown and Goldstein began to work with Endo, and they confirmed his results. Some dramatic results in the first limited clinical trials convinced several pharmaceutical firms to join the hunt for statins. A team at Merck, led by Alfred Alberts and P. Roy Vagelos, began screening fungal cultures and found a positive result after screening just 18 cultures. The new statin was eventually called lovastatin (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_NwHctGOZgF" id="dav_9781319322342_oyDwOZMKtN">Fig. 1</a>). In 1980, a rumor that compactin, at very high doses, was carcinogenic in dogs almost sidelined the race to develop statins, but the benefits to people with familial hypercholesterolemia were already evident. After much consultation with experts around the world and with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Merck proceeded carefully to develop lovastatin.

Lovastatin treatment lowers serum cholesterol by as much as 30% in individuals with hypercholesterolemia resulting from one defective copy of the gene for the LDL receptor. When combined with an edible resin that binds bile acids and prevents their reabsorption from the intestine, the statin is even more effective.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Vn0TB2knaz">Statins are now the most widely used drugs for lowering serum cholesterol levels. Side effects are always a concern with drugs, but in the case of statins, many of the side effects are positive. These drugs can improve blood flow, enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (so they don’t rupture and obstruct blood flow), reduce platelet aggregation, and reduce vascular inflammation. In patients taking statins for the first time, some of these effects occur before cholesterol levels drop and may be related to a secondary inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. Not all effects of statins are positive. Some individuals, usually among those taking statins in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, experience muscle pain or weakness that can become severe and even debilitating. For these patients, the effects may sometimes be ameliorated by diet supplementation with coenzyme <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_SXF1WAiIC5" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext>Q</mtext><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="upper Q Subscript 10" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch21_05EQ_0011.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>, a coenzyme that statin therapy depletes in the serum. A fairly long list of other side effects has been documented; most are rare. However, for the vast majority of people, the statin-mediated decrease in risks associated with coronary heart disease can be dramatic. As with all medications, statins should be used only in consultation with a physician.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_036iQMapCa">An alternative approach to controlling serum cholesterol levels is to activate LXRs, which has the overall effect of decreasing cholesterol absorption and promoting its excretion. This is the mode of action of a drug called ezetimibe. Ezetimibe is not as effective in lowering serum cholesterol as statins. However, in combination with statins, it can lower risk of stroke or heart attack in high-risk patients. Because LXR activation also activates SREBP1C, causing the liver to increase its production of fatty acids and triacylglycerols, new classes of drugs that target only intestinal LXRs are being developed. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_i6qIpkf9ib" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6MNVGOyryq">Cholesterol movement out of cells requires transporters. The human genome encodes 48 transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) class, and about half of these promote lipid transport. Two of them transport cholesterol out of cells. In this process, apoA-I interacts with the transporter ABCA1 in a cholesterol-rich cell. ABCA1 transports a load of cholesterol from inside the cell to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, where lipid-free or lipid-poor apoA-I picks it up, then transports it to the liver. Another transporter, ABCG1, interacts with mature HDL, facilitating the movement of cholesterol out of the cell and into the HDL. This efflux process is particularly critical to reverse cholesterol transport away from foam cells at the sites of plaques in the blood vessels of individuals with cardiovascular disease.</p>

Both familial HDL deficiency and Tangier disease are very rare (worldwide, fewer than 100 families with Tangier disease are known), but the existence of these diseases establishes a role for ABCA1 and ABCG1 proteins in the regulation of plasma HDL levels. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_zGOw6a2MHD" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

This yields 20,22-dihydroxycholesterol, which is similar to cholesterol except that C 17 is bonded to C 20 that is bonded to C H 3 to the left, red highlighted O above further bonded to H, and C 22 to the right bonded to H, to red highlighted O above further bonded to H, and to a chain to the right of C H 2 bonded to C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to 2 C H 3. An arrow labeled desmolase points down to prenenolone accompanied by a curved arrow to show the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H plus H plus plus O 2 and loss of N A D P plus plus H 2 O and with a branched arrow showing the loss of isocaproaldehyde. Isocaproaldehyde is C double bonded to red highlighted O to the upper left, bonded to H to the lower left, and bonded to C H 2 to the lower right further bonded to C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to 2 C H 3. Pregnenolone is similar to 20,20-dihydroxycholesterol except that C 17 is bonded to C above bonded to C H 3 to the upper left and double bonded to red highlighted O to the upper right.</p>

In some of these proteins, the attached lipid is the 15-carbon farnesyl group; others have the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group. Different enzymes attach the two types of lipids. It is possible that prenylation targets proteins to different membranes, depending on which lipid is attached. Protein prenylation is another important role for the isoprene derivatives of the pathway to cholesterol.</p>
