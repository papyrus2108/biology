<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_iA2r5kArZ3">Tumors and cancer are the result of uncontrolled cell division. Normally, cell division is regulated by a family of extracellular growth factors, proteins that cause resting cells to divide and, in some cases, differentiate. The result is a precise balance between the formation of new cells and cell destruction. Regulation of cell division ensures that skin cells are replaced every few weeks and white blood cells are replaced every few days. This is homeostasis at the organismal level. <span class="keep" id="dav_9781319322342_sxeh4oD4B4"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_ID81i7zbmf" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_12_PG230f.png"/> When</span> this balance is disturbed by defects in regulatory proteins, the result is sometimes the formation of a clone of cells that divide repeatedly and without regulation (a tumor) until their presence interferes with the function of normal tissues — cancer. The direct cause is almost always a genetic defect in one or more of the proteins that regulate cell division. In some cases, a defective gene is inherited from one parent; in other cases, the mutation occurs when a toxic compound from the environment (a mutagen or a carcinogen) or high-energy radiation interacts with the DNA of a single cell to damage it and introduce a mutation. In most cases there is both an inherited contribution and an environmental contribution, and in most cases, more than one mutation is required in order to cause completely unregulated division and full-blown cancer.</p>

During a viral infection, the host DNA sequence of a proto-oncogene is sometimes copied into the viral genome, where it proliferates with the virus. In subsequent viral infection cycles, the proto-oncogenes can become defective by truncation or mutation. Viruses, unlike animal cells, do not have effective mechanisms for correcting mistakes during DNA replication, so they accumulate mutations rapidly. When a virus carrying an oncogene infects a new host cell, the viral DNA (and oncogene) can be incorporated into the host cell’s DNA, where it can now interfere with the regulation of cell division in the host cell. In an alternative, nonviral mechanism, a single cell in a tissue exposed to carcinogens may suffer DNA damage that renders one of its regulatory proteins defective, with the same effect as the viral oncogenic mechanism: failed regulation of cell division.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_UCZDcHiIOP">The mutations that produce oncogenes are genetically dominant; if either of a pair of chromosomes contains a defective gene, that gene product sends the signal “divide,” and a tumor may result. The oncogenic defect can be in any of the proteins involved in communicating the “divide” signal. Oncogenes discovered thus far include those that encode secreted proteins that act as signaling molecules, growth factors, transmembrane proteins (receptors), cytoplasmic proteins (G proteins and protein kinases), and the nuclear transcription factors that control the expression of genes essential for cell division (Jun, Fos).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9SF4S9LL6b">Some oncogenes encode growth factor receptors with unregulated Tyr kinase activity; they signal continued cell division even when the growth factor is absent, leading to tumor formation. Tumor-producing mutations have been found in many of the signaling protein kinases we have discussed here, all of which use ATP as their substrate for phosphoryl transfer to another element in the signaling cascade. The development of drugs that inhibit the protein kinase activity is an obvious approach to treating cancers that result from unregulated kinase activity. However, most known protein kinase inhibitors act by blocking the binding site for ATP, which is similar in all protein kinases. Inhibitors that are effective against one protein kinase are likely to have intolerable side effects due to their inhibition of other, essential kinases. Nonetheless, the prominent role played by protein kinases in signaling processes related to normal and abnormal cell division has made these enzymes a prime target in the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dRvtL3COTo" id="dav_9781319322342_peLmuTvtje">Box 12-4</a>). <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_yo76Paf4RX" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_jDVyKnrVc0">When a single cell divides without any regulatory limitation, it eventually gives rise to a clone of cells so large that it interferes with normal physiological functions (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_x8AhC5P47w" id="dav_9781319322342_i3yavulciF">Fig. 1</a>). This is cancer, a leading cause of death in the developed world, and increasingly so in the developing world. In all types of cancer, the normal regulation of cell division has become dysfunctional due to defects in one or more genes. For example, genes encoding proteins that normally send intermittent signals for cell division become oncogenes, producing constitutively active signaling proteins, or genes encoding proteins that normally restrain cell division (tumor suppressor genes) mutate to produce proteins that lack this braking function. In many tumors, both kinds of mutation have occurred.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nQ5ZYRmuDo">Many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes encode protein kinases or proteins that act in pathways upstream from protein kinases. It is therefore reasonable to hope that specific inhibitors of protein kinases could prove valuable in the treatment of cancer. For example, a mutant form of the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor is a constantly active receptor Tyr kinase (RTK), signaling cell division whether EGF is present or not. In about 30% of all women with invasive breast cancer, the gene for the receptor ErbB2 (also called HER2/neu) is overexpressed, sometimes by as much as 100-fold. Another RTK, <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_mhASdTaA3v">vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)</strong>, must be activated for the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to provide a solid tumor with its own blood supply, and inhibition of VEGFR might starve a tumor of essential nutrients. Nonreceptor Tyr kinases can also mutate, resulting in constant signaling and unregulated cell division. For example, the oncogene <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_AZYt8il9XD">Abl</i> (from the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ROggrRrXR1">Ab</i>elson <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_BsPmTspWuF">l</i>eukemia virus) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare blood disease (~5,000 cases a year in the United States). Another group of oncogenes encode unregulated cyclin-dependent protein kinases. In each of these cases, specific protein kinase inhibitors might be valuable chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of disease. Not surprisingly, huge efforts are under way to develop such inhibitors. How should one approach this challenge?</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_zsVCOYscrf">Protein kinases of all types show striking conservation of structure at the active site. All share with the prototypical PKA structure the features shown in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZO5bvoUOPl" id="dav_9781319322342_5M7A77AT1W">Figure 2</a>: two lobes that enclose the active site, with a P loop that helps to align and bind the phosphoryl groups of ATP, an activation loop that moves to open the active site to the protein substrate, and a C helix that changes position as the enzyme is activated, bringing the residues in the substrate-binding cleft into their binding positions. Detailed knowledge of the structure around the ATP-binding site makes it possible to design drugs that inhibit a <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_2MjCuIJcaf">specific</i> protein kinase by (1) blocking the critical ATP-binding site, while (2) interacting with residues around that site that are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_tZfRDZtd13">unique</i> to that particular protein kinase.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_BXSRphcPgT">The simplest protein kinase inhibitors are ATP analogs that occupy the ATP-binding site but cannot serve as phosphoryl group donors. Many such compounds are known, but their clinical usefulness is limited by their lack of selectivity — they inhibit virtually all protein kinases and would produce unacceptable side effects. More selectivity is seen with compounds that fill part of the ATP-binding site but also interact outside this site with parts of the protein unique to the target protein kinase. A third possible strategy is based on the fact that although the active conformations of all protein kinases are similar, their inactive conformations are not. Drugs that target the inactive conformation of a specific protein kinase and prevent its conversion to the active form may have a higher specificity of action. A fourth approach employs the great specificity of antibodies. For example, monoclonal antibodies (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch05_03.xhtml#page167" id="dav_9781319322342_k64OLOY2Bv">p. 167</a>) that bind the extracellular portions of specific RTKs could eliminate the receptors’ kinase activity by preventing dimerization or by causing their removal from the cell surface. In some cases, an antibody selectively binding to the surface of cancer cells could cause the immune system to attack those cells.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Pyv1Mp4dQD">The search for drugs active against specific protein kinases has yielded encouraging results. For example, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_e05m8C1rEA" id="dav_9781319322342_bFOnYiitNa">Fig. 3a</a>), a small-molecule inhibitor, has proved nearly 100% effective in bringing about remission in patients with early-stage chronic myeloid leukemia. Erlotinib (Tarceva; <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_e05m8C1rEA" id="dav_9781319322342_gd7EdFwW3c">Fig. 3b</a>), which targets EGFR, is effective against advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because many cell-division signaling systems involve more than one protein kinase, inhibitors that act on several protein kinases may be useful in the treatment of cancer. Sunitinib (Sutent) and sorafenib (Nexavar) target several protein kinases, including VEGFR and PDGFR. These two drugs are in clinical use for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and advanced renal cell carcinoma, respectively. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), cetuximab (Erbitux), and bevacizumab (Avastin) are monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB2/HER2/neu, EGFR, and VEGFR, respectively; all three drugs are in clinical use for certain types of cancer. </p>

The cells of a retinoblastoma have two defective versions of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_KLsHzpuBeY">Rb</i> gene (two defective alleles). Very young children who develop retinoblastoma commonly have multiple tumors in both eyes. These children have inherited one defective copy of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_JvKPZieX7J">Rb</i> gene, which is present in every cell; each tumor is derived from a single retinal cell that has undergone a mutation in its remaining good copy of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_fF6257TSzE">Rb</i> gene. (A fetus with two mutant alleles in every cell is nonviable.) People with retinoblastoma who survive childhood also have a high incidence of cancers of the lung, prostate, and breast later in life.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_YMmZ1WREHN">A far less likely event is that a person born with two good copies of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_CSKOevYQbz">Rb</i> gene will have independent mutations in both copies in the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_9RQ6kEe0c2">same</i> cell. Some individuals do develop retinoblastomas later in childhood, usually with only one tumor in one eye. These individuals, presumably, were born with two good copies (alleles) of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_5bCaAwIlnD">Rb</i> in every cell, but both <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_09QUGXvRn9">Rb</i> alleles in a single retinal cell have undergone mutation, leading to a tumor. After the child reaches about age 3, retinal cells stop dividing, and retinoblastomas at later ages are quite rare.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_JDgz5GwQeW">Stability genes (also called caretaker genes) encode proteins that function in the repair of major genetic defects that result from aberrant DNA replication, ionizing radiation, or environmental carcinogens. Mutations in these genes lead to a high frequency of unrepaired damage (mutations) in other genes, including proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and thus to cancer. Among the stability genes are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_hr1ei0QaNi">ATM</i> (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_09.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_q9Xb9vmix2" id="dav_9781319322342_nc288ABwZX">Fig. 12-40</a>); the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_JWcDT1vCFu">XP</i> gene family, in which mutations lead to xeroderma pigmentosum; and the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_AsG0V9Hbcg">BRCA1</i> genes associated with some types of breast cancer (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GpUBZNePds" id="dav_9781319322342_GUEFl6bH14">Box 25-1</a>). Mutations in the gene for p53 also cause tumors; in more than 90% of human cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (skin cancers) and in about 50% of all other human cancers, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_EAqRMVOYVQ">p53</i> is defective.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_z7K0nQtHxM">Mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes do not have an all-or-none effect. In some cancers, perhaps in all, the progression from a normal cell to a malignant tumor requires an accumulation of mutations (sometimes over several decades), none of which, alone, is responsible for the end effect. For example, the development of colorectal cancer has several recognizable stages, each associated with a mutation (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Tunpxeciw4"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_7513TdSeyV" id="dav_9781319322342_PuReySmhp2">Fig. 12-41</a></strong>). If an epithelial cell in the colon undergoes mutation of both copies of the tumor <span aria-label="455" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page455" role="doc-pagebreak"/>suppressor gene <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_4ibdZ56fkI">APC</i> (adenomatous polyposis coli), it begins to divide faster than normal and produces a clone of itself, a benign polyp (early adenoma). For reasons not yet known, the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_o5xRYyuxPz">APC</i> mutation results in chromosomal instability, and whole regions of a chromosome are lost or rearranged during cell division. This instability can lead to another mutation, commonly in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_61BBIEP524">ras</i>, that converts the clone into an intermediate (precancerous) adenoma.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4LS4hbSJ02">A third mutation (often in the tumor suppressor gene <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_IwxngjxAQz">DCC</i>) leads to a late adenoma. Only when both copies of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Yp1pvCg95U">p53</i> become defective does this cell mass become a carcinoma — a malignant, life-threatening tumor. The full sequence therefore requires at least seven genetic “hits”: two on each of three tumor suppressor genes (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_PANQecM29n">APC, DCC</i><i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_fk6nqa3OVY">Ρ</i>, and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_GPP3Gej39e">p53</i>) and one on the proto-oncogene <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_vjeGNHjhIE">ras</i>. There are probably several other routes to colorectal cancer as well, but the principle that full malignancy results only from multiple mutations is likely to hold true for all of them. Because mutations accumulate over time, the chances of developing full-blown metastatic cancer rise with age.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_mvAefujQho">When a polyp is detected in the early adenoma stage and the cells containing the first mutations are removed surgically, late adenomas and carcinomas will not develop; hence the importance of early detection. Cells and organisms, too, have their early detection systems. For example, the ATM and ATR proteins can detect DNA damage too extensive to be repaired effectively. They then trigger, through a pathway that includes p53, the process of apoptosis, in which a cell that has become dangerous to the organism kills itself.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eSkJwd9v1f">The development of fast and inexpensive sequencing methods has opened a new window on the process by which cancer develops. In a typical study of cancers in humans, the sequences of all 20,000 genes were determined in about 3,300 different tumors, and then compared with the gene sequences in noncancerous tissue from the same patient. Almost 300,000 mutations were detected in all. Only a small fraction of these mutations, the <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_YLjHJlApp3">driver mutations</strong>, were the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Ajtuqk6qMr">cause</i> of unregulated cell division; the vast majority <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_AR37W73OUQ" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo lspace="0" rspace="0">&gt;</mo><mn>99.9</mn><mi>%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="left-parenthesis greater-than 99.9 percent-sign right-parenthesis" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch12_10EQ_0003.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> were “passenger mutations,” which occurred randomly and did not confer a selective growth advantage on the tissue in which they occurred. Among the driver mutations were those in about 75 tumor suppressor genes and about 65 oncogenes. These 140 driver mutations fell in three general categories: those that affect cell survival (in genes encoding Ras, PI3K, MAPK, for example), those that affect cells’ ability to maintain an intact genome (ATM, ATR), and those that affect cell fate, causing cells to divide, differentiate, or become quiescent (APC is one example). A relatively small number of mutations were very common in multiple types of cancer, in the genes for Ras, p53, and pRb, for example. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_GPipjaMs4u" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

One trigger for apoptosis is irreparable damage to DNA. Programmed cell death also occurs during the normal development of an embryo, when some cells must die to give a tissue or an organ its final shape. Carving fingers from stubby limb buds requires the precisely timed death of cells between developing finger bones. During development of the nematode <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_gwZg6mxq4f">C. elegans</i> from a fertilized egg, exactly 131 cells (of a total of 1,090 somatic cells in the embryo) must undergo programmed death in order to construct the adult body.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_zG5bT08nYy">Apoptosis also has roles in processes other than development. If a developing antibody-producing cell generates antibodies against a protein or glycoprotein that is normally present in the body, that cell undergoes programmed death in the thymus gland — an essential mechanism for eliminating anti-self antibodies (the cause of many autoimmune diseases). The monthly sloughing of cells of the uterine wall (menstruation) is another case of apoptosis mediating normal cell death. The dropping of leaves in the fall is the result of apoptosis in specific cells of the stem of a plant. Sometimes cell suicide is not programmed but occurs in response to biological circumstances that threaten the rest of the organism. For example, a virus-infected cell that dies before completion of the infection cycle prevents spread of the virus to nearby cells. Severe stresses such as heat, hyperosmolarity, UV light, and gamma irradiation also trigger cell suicide; presumably the organism is better off with any aberrant, potentially mutated cells dead.</p>

The signal for suicide often comes from outside, through a surface receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), produced by cells of the immune system, interacts with cells through specific TNF receptors. These receptors have TNF-binding sites on the outer face of the plasma membrane and a “death domain” (~80 amino acid residues) that carries the self-destruct signal through the membrane to cytosolic proteins such as TRADD (TNF receptor–associated death domain) (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_gzskAHWROv"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_10.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_UqIZhGThiy" id="dav_9781319322342_ziFg6d39q4">Fig. 12-42</a></strong>).</p>

Three blue ovals beneath the membrane extend into the membrane and are labeled T R A D D. Similar red ovals are present above the membrane the membrane. The top pieces of the blue ovals and bottom pieces of the red ovals are darker and each is separated by a line from the rest of the oval. These smaller, dark pieces of the ovals are labeled death domains. Each of the red ovals has a narrow cylinder joining it to a lighter red rectangle above and each light red rectangle has a small gray square on top. The gray squares are labeled T N F Greek letter alpha and the light red rectangles are labeled T N F Greek letter alpha receptor. A green oval labeled procaspase-8 has a curved arrow that runs past the bottom of the blue ovals to a brighter green oval labeled capsase-8 that has short lines radiating from all sides. An arrow points down from caspase-8 to a gray mitochondrion below from which an arrow points to cytochrome italicized c end italics. An arrow points down from cytochrome italicized c end italics and is joined by an arrow from A p a f-1 before reaching apoptosome. A line extends from apoptosome to the top center of a curved arrow from a small purple oval labeled procaspase-9 on the left to two similar purple ovals on the right that are attached together, surrounded by short radiating lines, and labeled caspase-9. Three arrows point down from capsase-9 to apoptosis. A sequence of three arrows points down from caspase-8 above to caspases 3, 6, 7, from which an arrow points to apoptosis. An arrow points from apoptosis to an irregular cell with many membrane-bound spheres of varying sizes near it.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LCNF9v7CRV">When caspase-8, an “initiator” caspase, is activated by an apoptotic signal carried through TRADD, it further self-activates by cleaving its own proenzyme form. Mitochondria are one target of active caspase-8. The protease causes the release of certain proteins contained between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes: cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_n40a58ViOA">c</i> and several “effector” caspases (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch19_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_bOUFPHNbCK" id="dav_9781319322342_Bragg4Yjjk">Fig. 19-39</a>). Cytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Bo0M3UmyYs">c</i> binds to the proenzyme form of the effector enzyme caspase-9 and stimulates its proteolytic activation. The activated caspase-9, in turn, catalyzes wholesale destruction of cellular proteins — a major cause of apoptotic cell death. One specific target of caspase action is a caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ND9rADx6uT">In apoptosis, the monomeric products of protein and DNA degradation (amino acids and nucleotides) are <span aria-label="456" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page456" role="doc-pagebreak"/>released in a controlled process that allows them to be taken up and reused by neighboring cells. Apoptosis thus allows the organism to eliminate a cell that is unneeded or potentially dangerous without wasting its components.</p>
