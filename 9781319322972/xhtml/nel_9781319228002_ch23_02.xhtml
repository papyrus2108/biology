Hormones serve to coordinate the metabolic activities of several tissues or organs. Virtually every process in a complex organism is regulated by one or more hormones: maintenance of blood pressure, blood volume, and electrolyte balance; embryogenesis; sexual differentiation, development, and reproduction; hunger, eating behavior, digestion, and fuel allocation — to name but a few.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pmHw3vsvwW">The coordination of metabolism in mammals is achieved by the <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_LktfUUYJWG">neuroendocrine system</dfn>. Individual cells in one tissue sense a change in the organism’s circumstances and respond by secreting a chemical messenger that passes to another cell in the same or different tissue, where the messenger binds to a specific receptor molecule and triggers a change in this target cell. These chemical messengers may relay information over very short or very long distances. In neuronal signaling (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_ZZRnnQgSSN"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_LELGKZ5UIN" id="dav_9781319322342_VwQDZSOAsr">Fig. 23-1a</a></strong>), the chemical messenger is a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine, for example) that may travel only a fraction of a micrometer across a synaptic cleft to the next neuron in a network. In endocrine signaling (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_LELGKZ5UIN" id="dav_9781319322342_8xvGTwSCT3">Fig. 23-1b</a>), the messenger is a hormone that is carried in the bloodstream to neighboring cells or to distant organs and tissues; it may travel a meter or more before encountering its target cell. Except for this anatomic difference, the neuronal and endocrine signaling mechanisms are remarkably similar, and the same molecule can sometimes act as both neurotransmitter and hormone. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, for example, serve as neurotransmitters at certain synapses of the brain and at neuromuscular junctions of smooth muscle and as hormones that regulate fuel metabolism in liver and muscle. The following discussion of cellular signaling emphasizes hormone action, drawing on discussions of fuel metabolism in earlier chapters, but most of the fundamental mechanisms described here also occur in neurotransmitter action.</p>

The target cell (another neuron, a myocyte, or a secretory cell) is only a fraction of a micrometer or a few micrometers away from the site of neurotransmitter release. (b) In endocrine signaling, hormones (such as insulin produced in pancreatic <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_3TxPON6bt9">β</i> cells) are secreted into the bloodstream, which carries them throughout the body to target tissues that may be a meter or more away from the secreting cell.

Signaling distance is labeled along the left vertical side of this square and brackets indicate that the distance of the top portion is in micrometers and the distance of the bottom portion is in c m to m. In part a, labeled neuronal signaling, a neuron is shown at the top center with a cell body containing a nucleus, many dendrites extending to the sides and top, and an axon extending vertically downward accompanied by a downward arrow labeled, nerve impulse. The axon divides into two portions. The left half further divides into three parts that extend to target cells. These ends further divide into two of three smaller stands at the very ends. At the end of each of these linear strands, there are small blue spheres labeled neurotransmitters between the end of the terminal portion extending from the axon and the target cells below. From left to right, neurotransmitters are shown being released between two strands on the left and a neuron, between the third strand and the top of a fusiform muscle, and from the right-hand strand and a layer of three cells. The boundary between the smaller top and larger bottom portions of the square runs through the center of the neuron, muscle, and layer of cells. An arrow pointing downward along an axon from the neuron is labeled nerve impulse. The fusiform muscle is labeled with the word contraction beneath. The layer of three cells to the right have thicker bottom membranes, nuclei, vesicles near the top surfaces, and irregular top surfaces. Arrows point up from the top surface of each cell and text below reads secretion. Part b, labeled endocrine signaling, shows a blood vessel that curves from the lower left of the square to end at the right end of the square just below half the vertical height of the square. Beneath the square, the endocrine pancreas is shown as a tan organ with many small, roughly round pieces joined together to make a long piece across the top that narrows to the upper right and a wider left side that bends down and folds back toward the right. Three red squares and three blue triangles are shown in the pancreas with an arrow pointing up to show them entering the bloodstream, shown as pink material inside the blood vessel. The bloodstream contains many of these red squares and blue triangles, which are labeled hormones. An arrow points up from the center of the blood vessel to a blue triangle just beneath the fusiform muscle cell and the word contraction. Near the right end of the blood vessel, an arrow points up to a red square beneath the layer of three cells and the word secretion. Between the arrows to the muscle and the layer of three cells, two arrows point downward to two blue triangles between the blood vessel and a layer of target cells below. Text between the blood vessel and target cells reads, metabolic change.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_s9tLQBpoK4">A single hormone molecule, in forming a hormone-receptor complex, activates a catalyst that produces many molecules of second messenger, so the receptor serves as both signal transducer and signal amplifier. The signal may be further amplified by a signaling cascade, such as we saw in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and breakdown by epinephrine (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zrCdnAelAA" id="dav_9781319322342_jmMceJYrzE">Fig. 12-7</a>). Signal amplification allows one epinephrine molecule to result in the production of many thousands or millions of molecules of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_E7P9ljFqey">Water-insoluble hormones, including the steroid, retinoid, and thyroid hormones, readily pass through the plasma membrane of their target cells to reach their receptor proteins in the nucleus (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_NI7KEX3ciY" id="dav_9781319322342_GFkZ2ReSI7">Fig. 23-2</a>). The hormone-receptor complex itself carries the message: it interacts with DNA to alter the expression of specific genes, changing the enzyme content of the cell and thereby changing cellular metabolism (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_08.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_9MOJX6nt1Z" id="dav_9781319322342_W1ftMoOGzB">Fig. 12-34</a>).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_WBv7GUUT06">Hormones that act through plasma membrane receptors generally trigger very rapid physiological or biochemical responses. Just seconds after the adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine into the bloodstream, skeletal muscle responds by accelerating the breakdown of glycogen. By contrast, the thyroid hormones and the sex (steroid) hormones promote maximal responses in their target tissues only after hours or even days. These differences in response time correspond to different modes of action. In general, the fast-acting hormones lead to a change in the activity of one or more preexisting enzymes in the cell, by allosteric mechanisms or covalent modification. The slower-acting hormones generally alter gene expression, resulting in the synthesis of more (upregulation) or less (downregulation) of the regulated protein(s).</p>

In response, the hypothalamus produces releasing factors, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), that pass directly to the nearby pituitary gland through blood vessels and neurons that connect the two glands. The pituitary gland secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (also called corticotropin or ACTH), which travels through the blood to the adrenal cortex and triggers the release of cortisol. Cortisol, the ultimate hormone in this cascade, acts through its receptor in many types of target cells to alter their metabolism. In hepatocytes, one effect of cortisol is to increase the rate of gluconeogenesis.</p>

These feedback mechanisms accomplish the same end as those that limit the output of a biosynthetic pathway (compare <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fXK9lwEeUZ" id="dav_9781319322342_GtkxdqbIL6">Fig. 23-6</a> with <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch22_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_QseAxs7iCC" id="dav_9781319322342_tlm9afR5O7">Fig. 22-37</a>): a product is synthesized (or released) only until the necessary concentration is reached. In the blood-clotting cascade (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_aYBClrmX51" id="dav_9781319322342_anmdU5xAqE">Fig. 6-44</a>) we saw a similar pattern: a signal stimulates a cascade of protein activations; feedback mechanisms limit their action and the duration of the response.</p>

Other tissue-specific peptide hormones signal inadequate supplies of stored triacylglycerols or low blood glucose levels. All of these signals impinge, directly or indirectly, on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus, which integrates these signals and influences feeding behavior and energy-yielding metabolism in the tissues. Nerves carry electrical signals from the brain to the other tissues to complete the information circuit and achieve homeostasis (not shown).
