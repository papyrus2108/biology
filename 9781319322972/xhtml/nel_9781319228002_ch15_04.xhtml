<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_0fL1riQJNp">As we have seen, the mobilization of stored glycogen is brought about by glycogen phosphorylase, which degrades glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch15_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_HJgcuw7fPd" id="dav_9781319322342_8FH5ZULFue">Fig. 15-3</a>). Glycogen phosphorylase provides an especially instructive case of enzyme regulation. It was one of the first known examples of an allosterically regulated enzyme and the first enzyme shown to be controlled by reversible phosphorylation. It was also one of the first allosteric enzymes for which the detailed three-dimensional structures of the active and inactive forms were revealed by x-ray crystallographic studies. Glycogen phosphorylase also illustrates how isozymes play their tissue-specific roles.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8is51Xkjqc">In muscle, this provides fuel for glycolysis to sustain muscle contraction for the fight-or-flight response signaled by epinephrine. In liver, glycogen breakdown counters the low blood glucose signaled by glucagon, by releasing glucose into the blood. These different roles are reflected in subtle differences in the regulatory mechanisms in muscle and liver. The glycogen phosphorylases of liver and muscle are isozymes, encoded by different genes and differing in their regulatory properties.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_TmjL6xxLiv">Having looked at the mechanisms that regulate individual enzymes, we can now consider the overall shifts in carbohydrate metabolism that occur in the well-fed state, during fasting, and in the fight-or-flight response — signaled by insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine, respectively. We need to contrast two cases in which regulation serves different ends: (1) the role of hepatocytes in supplying glucose to the blood; and (2) the <span aria-label="569" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page569" role="doc-pagebreak"/>selfish use of carbohydrate fuels by extrahepatic tissues, typified by skeletal muscle (myocytes), to support their own activities.</p>

In a hepatocyte, insulin has two immediate effects: it inactivates GSK3; and it activates a protein phosphatase, probably PP1. These two actions fully activate glycogen synthase. PP1 also inactivates glycogen phosphorylase <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_M4zBToaDbM">a</i> and phosphorylase kinase by dephosphorylating both, effectively stopping glycogen breakdown. Glucose enters the hepatocyte through the high-capacity transporter GLUT2, always present in the plasma membrane, and the elevated intracellular glucose leads to dissociation of hexokinase IV (glucokinase) from its nuclear regulatory protein (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch14_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ZkARuN48Sx" id="dav_9781319322342_xvAfyCt6r3">Fig. 14-21</a>). Hexokinase IV enters the cytosol and phosphorylates glucose, stimulating glycolysis and supplying the precursor for glycogen synthesis. Under these conditions, hepatocytes use the excess glucose in the blood to synthesize glycogen, up to the limit of about 10% of the total weight of the liver.</p>

The regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in muscle reflects these differences from liver. First, myocytes lack receptors for glucagon, which are present on hepatocytes. Second, the muscle isozyme of pyruvate kinase is not phosphorylated by PKA, so glycolysis is not turned off when [cAMP] is high.
