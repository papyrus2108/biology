Processing can include addition or deletion of nucleotide sequences as well as chemical modification of RNA nucleotides. All of these events can be used to control the posttranscriptional fate of the RNA in the cell. As a result, many mature RNAs are not exact copies of the DNA genes from which they were transcribed. Some of the most interesting molecular events in RNA metabolism occur during posttranscriptional processing. Intriguingly, several of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions have active sites composed of RNA rather than protein.

Under the heading transcription and 5 prime capping, an R N A polymerase Roman numeral 2 is shown at the left with the D N A running through it and forming a transcription bubble in the open area in its center. A green R N A extends from this bubble out to the upper left to end at a red 5 prime cap. The narrow C T D tail extending to the upper left of the polymerase alongside the R N A has three red circles labeled P on each side. An arrow labeled transcription of pre-m R N A points to the right. This yields a similar figure labeled primary transcript in which the green R N A is longer and has a green bend before another green horizontal piece that ends in a short red cap at the 5 prime end. The green region is labeled exon and the yellow region is labeled intron. An arrow points right beneath text reading, splicing, cleavage, and polyadenylation. This yields a similar structure in which the green R N A has broken so that the yellow piece representing an intron is now a circle with a small yellow protrusion and a horizontal mature m R N A is visible above as a green horizontal line with a short red cap on the 5 prime end and a right side that ends at A A A (A) subscript italicized n end italics end subscript 3 prime. An arrow labeled termination points diagonally upward to show R N A polymerase Roman numeral 2 above and separate from the double stranded D N A below. Part b is a micrograph with a long vertical strand of D N A running up its center from its 3 prime end at the bottom to its 5 prime end at the top.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_lWbF7p0tYt">In bacteria, the mRNA used for translation is generally a direct copy of the DNA gene sequence, continuing along the DNA template without interruption until the information needed to specify the polypeptide is complete. However, the notion that <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_eoX6LAEETE">all</i> genes are continuous was disproved in 1977 when Phillip Sharp and Richard Roberts independently discovered that many genes for polypeptides in eukaryotes are interrupted by noncoding sequences (introns).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_0XkWaMKjIj"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_ZaqENKuwsr" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01b.png"/> The vast majority of genes in vertebrates contain introns; among the few exceptions are those that encode histones. The occurrence of introns in other eukaryotes varies. Many genes of the yeast <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_vwNgecNKDA">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> lack introns, but introns are more common in some other yeast species. Introns are also found in a few bacterial and archaeal genes. Introns in DNA are transcribed along with the rest of the gene by RNA polymerases. The introns in the primary RNA transcript are then spliced, and the exons are joined to form a mature, functional RNA. In eukaryotic mRNAs, most exons are less than 1,000 nucleotides long, with many in the 100 to 200 nucleotide size range, encoding stretches of 30 to 60 amino acids within a longer polypeptide. Introns vary in size from 50 to more than 700,000 nucleotides, with a median length of about 1,800. Genes of higher eukaryotes, including humans, typically have much more DNA devoted to introns than to exons. For example, the human dystrophin gene encodes a pre-mRNA more than 2 million nucleotides long. However, the final mRNA is 14,000 nucleotides long, indicating that more than 99% of the transcribed RNA is found within introns and removed by splicing. Deficiencies in dystrophin expression can lead to muscular dystrophies. The ~20,000 genes of the human genome include more than 200,000 introns.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_zzfHcywxEo">There are four classes of introns (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_8f17LNK8Lb"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GAN420heQw" id="dav_9781319322342_evrCuyOLk5">Table 26-3</a></strong>). The first two, the group I and group II introns, differ in the details of their splicing mechanisms but share one surprising characteristic: they are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_P766VfCdD5">self-splicing</i> — no proteins are needed to carry out catalysis. The introns found in the nuclear-encoded genes of eukaryotes comprise the third class. These pre-mRNA introns are removed by a large RNP called the spliceosome. Although the spliceosome requires dozens of proteins for its function, its active site includes RNA. The final class of introns requires protein enzymes for their removal. These introns are found in some tRNAs as well as certain mRNAs, such as that encoding the Xbox binding protein 1, Xbp1. Protein-mediated splicing of the XBP1 transcript regulates the cellular response to unfolded proteins that occurs under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress in human cells. The mechanisms of tRNA and XBP1 mRNA splicing are similar.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_PoTC0TtLM3">A green R N A primary transcript has a 5 prime end on the left and a 3 prime end on the right. Near the center, it reaches a green box labeled U next to a yellow box labeled u G that connects to a thin circular line that thickens at the upper right side where it contains text reading, p C p A p A, then becomes a thin strand that runs down to a green square labeled p U that joins to the green strand of R N A that ends at the 3 prime end. The yellow region is labeled intron. O H is bonded to the middle of the thick part of the intron, beneath the central A, and has a red pair of electrons on O from which a red arrow points to p at the left end of the yellow piece. A gray box below contains text reading, The 2 prime O H of a specific adenosine in the intron acts as a nucleophile, attacking the 5 prime splice site to form a lariat structure. This yields an intermediate in which the left half of the structure consists of green R N A that ends at a green box labeled U joined to a yellow box labeled O H with a red pair of electrons on O and the right-hand half of the structure consists of green R N A that runs left to a green box labeled U p with a yellow strand from p up to a “T”-shaped box that begins with A below p below A in the center of a horizontal yellow box. This box reads, G p A p C and a thin yellow strand loops from the left side over the top to join the right side. A red arrow points from the red pair of electrons on O to p in the green box labeled p U. An arrow points down with a branched arrow curving off to show the loss of the yellow piece. Accompanying text in a gray box reads, The 3 prime O H of the 5 prime exon acts as a nucleophile, completing the reaction. Text above the yellow structure reads, Adenosine in the lariat structure has three phosphodiester bonds. The yellow lariat structure contains a rounded portion with a thin top and sides that meets a thicker portion at the bottom center. From left to right, this thicker portion reads, G p A p C. Beneath A p, a vertical piece reads p A before reaching another thin yellow piece that ends at O H (3 prime). The spliced R N A produced has a 5 prime end and then a straight horizontal piece of green R N A with a green box labeled U p U in the center before narrowing again to reach the 3 prime end. Part b shows an intron and 3 prime exon on the lower left connected by a long strand to an intron on the lower right, and an exon above in green. The bottom left yellow square contains a sugar with O at the bottom vertex, C 1 prime at the lower left vertex bonded to a box labeled A, C 2 prime at the upper left vertex bonded to O further bonded to a long strand, C 3 prime at the upper right vertex bonded to O H with a red pair of electron on O, and C 4 at the lower right vertex connected by a long curved strand to O bonded to C 3 prime of the second sugar in a yellow box. This sugar has O at the top vertex, C 1 prime bonded to a box labeled G, C 2 prime bonded to O H, C 3 bonded to O further bonded to the intron at the lower left, and C 4 prime bonded to C H 2 bonded to O outside of the yellow box bonded to P bonded to O minus to the lower left, double boned to O to the upper left within the green box labeled exon above, and bonded to O above in the green box further bonded to C 3 prime of a sugar. This sugar has O at the top vertex, C 1 prime bonded to a box labeled U, C 2 prime bonded to O H, C 3 prime bonded to O further bonded below, and C 4 prime bonded to C H 2 further bonded to a long wavy line outside of the green box that ends at 5 prime. Red arrows point from a red pair of electrons on O bonded to C 3 prime of the intron at the lower left to P to the upper right and from the bond between the same P and O in the green box to the same O. An arrow points down to show a similar structure in which the introns are the same except that the lower left intron now has O bonded to C 3 prime of the sugar also bonded to P bonded to O bonded to C H 2 bonded to C 4 prime of the other intron, bonded to O minus to the upper left, and double bonded to O above. This phosphate no longer extends into the green exon box. The exon now has C 3 prime bonded to O H instead of bonded to O bonded to P of the phosphate. The left-hand intron still has a long wavy line leading to text reading, intron and 3 prime exon.</p>

The sequences and structure shown were obtained from x-ray crystal structure shown in (a). The human U1 snRNA normally contains pseudouridines at positions 5 and 6; however, an unmodified RNA was used to determine this structure. (c) Spliceosomes are assembled on introns from snRNPs and proceed through stages of assembly, activation, catalysis of intron removal, release of the RNA products, and recycling of the splicing factors. In addition to the U snRNPs discussed in the text, a large protein-only supramolecular complex called the Prp19-containing complex (also known as NineTeen Complex, or NTC) is required for splicing and joins the spliceosome during the activation step. (d) Structure of the human spliceosome, determined by cryo-EM. Nuclear pre-mRNA splicing requires this large molecular machine composed of dozens of proteins and five snRNAs to remove many different introns. By comparison, using similar chemistry, group II introns can catalyze their own removal. In order to highlight the RNA catalytic core of the spliceosome and the U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs, some protein splicing factors are not shown in this view. The RNA appears discontinuous where the structure could not be resolved. <span class="attribution" id="dav_9781319322342_WmS5SASUc4">[Data from (a, b) PDB ID 4PJO, Y.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_f1xtjGHn0h">Part a shows a roughly spherical structure with dark purple, light purple, and pink subunits. Clockwise from the bottom, it is light pink, purple, dark purple with a protrusion to the left, light pink, purple, light pink, and purple. A green rounded piece at the lower left has a long, thin protrusion to end at an oblong piece at the front lower left. A small green piece is seen to the upper rear right protruding from the pink piece right above a light blue piece that runs horizontally across most of the right center of the purple and pink structure. This light blue piece has a rounded side in front of the purple and pink structure, then a thinner rectangular piece that extends down to the lower right. Within this blue structure, there is a white strand or R N A that runs horizontally to the left beneath a yellow strand of R N A labeled intron that begins at the lower right, arcs up to a peak where ethe thin and thicker parts of the light blue structure meet, and then loops downward again to end beneath a white strand of R N A that continues down to the left. This white strand joins a central region where a piece of R N A runs diagonally from the center of the purple and pink structure to the left of the light blue structure to the lower right below, where it is labeled U 1. Just below the purple and pink structure, a double stranded piece of R N A runs almost horizontally from near the bottom of the green structure to the left, just before it widens at its lower left and, and to a brown rounded structure to the right. A white arrow points right to part b to show a close-up of the interaction between the yellow intron and U 1 in the light blue structure. Part b shows the 3 prime end of the white strand labeled U 1 beginning at the lower left and curving up, then curving down and back up to end at its 5 prime end. The yellow intron begins at its 5 prime end beneath the left side of U 1, rises up to peak above the lowest piece of U 1, and then bends back down to end at its 3 prime end at the lower right. Below, the intron and U 1 are shown as horizontal strands to show the base pairing between them. The intron is shown across the top running from its 5 prime end on the left to its 3 prime end on the right. It begins with a sugar with its upper right vertex bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to C H 2 bonded to the upper left vertex of a sugar with its bottom vertex bonded to a base and its upper right vertex bonded to a circle labeled P. This repeats to show a total of eight nucleotides. The bases are highlighted in yellow and numbered. From left to right with the base abbreviation and label, they are A negative 2, G negative 1, G plus 1, U plus 2, A plus 3, A plus 4, G plus 5, and U plus 6. The complementary strand of U 1 below begins with its 3 prime end on the left and runs to its 5 prime end on the right. It begins with a gray sugar with its upper right vertex bonded to a base and its lower right vertex bonded to C H 2 bonded to a circle labeled P bonded to the lower left vertex of a sugar. This repeats for a total of nine nucleotides. The nucleotides are gray and numbered. Hydrogen bonds are shown as sets of three short blue lines. From left to right they are G 11, U 10 connected by two hydrogen bonds to A negative 2, C 9 connected by three hydrogen bonds to G negative 1, C 8 connected by three hydrogen bonds to G plus 1, A 7 connected by two hydrogen bonds to U plus 2, U 6 connected by two hydrogen bonds to A plus 3, U 5 connected by two hydrogen bonds to A plus 4, C 4 connected by three hydrogen bonds to G plus 5, and A 3 connected by two hydrogen bonds to U plus 6. Part c shows a horizontal line at the top with its 5 prime end on the left and its 3 prime end on the right. It has a small green exon on the left, a long yellow intron region in the center, and then a small green exon on the right. An arrow curves from three spheres at the eleven o’clock position to meet with a line from the R N A strand above in step 1 assembly. The spheres are blue U 6, purple U 5, light blue U 2, and orange N T C. The product of step 1 is a strand in which they spheres are arranged over the top of the intron. Gray U 1 is at the left side of the intron, then U 6 overlaps its lower right and overlaps U 4 to the right. Above, U 5 extends above U 6 and U 4. U 2 emerges from behind these to extend to the right end of the intron. An arrow labeled step 2 activation points down to a similar structure at the five 5 prime position in which U 1 has left and the arrangement of the spheres has changed. U 6 is at the left and overlaps U 5 to its lower right. N T C is to the right of U 5 and overlaps the right side of U 2. N T C is below U 2 and slightly to the right and overlaps the bottom right of U 2 and right of U 5. An arrow labeled 3 catalysis points from here to a structure at the seven o’clock position. This new structure has the cylinders in the same positions, but the horizontal strand has changed and broken. The green 5 prime end begins at the lower left and runs diagonally up across the bottom of U 6 to end at the place where U 6, U 5, and U 2 meet. The green 3 prime end begins at the lower right and runs diagonally up along the top of N T C to turn yellow where N T C and U 2 meet. This yellow part continues to run up diagonally, loops right above U 2, and loops back to meet a point near its start in the middle of U 2. An arrow labeled 4 products has an arrow branching off to show a green horizontal strand of two exons joined together with the five prime end on the left and the 3 prime end on the right. Just above, a second arrow branches off to show the loss of a yellow circle with a tail. The arrow continues up to the eleven o’clock starting position. The top of the arrow, just below this position, is labeled 5 recycling. All data are approximate. Part d shows a structure made up of many cylinders and strands. It has a white rounded part at the upper left with a brown horizontal piece below that connects to the main central region, which is white in the center with some tan extending horizontally to the lower left, some pink to the upper right, some tan and pink to the upper center right, a dark brown cylinder at the upper right, brown along the white slide extending down below the main structure slightly to the right with one darker cylinder. The lower left corner of this central region is connected to a piece below that is brown on the left and white on the right with the white part ending at a round white part with a purple wireframe structure inside it. At the place where these brown and white parts meet, a green single strand label exon runs up to the center across a purple strand labeled U 5 that runs diagonally down to the lower right. The green strand continues up to meet an almost horizontal yellow R N A that extends to the right and is labeled intron and curves up to the left to end at the upper left side. A blue R N A labeled U 6 runs briefly along the intron after it meets the green strand, then bends down to end at the lower right. A purple R N A labeled U 2 begins at the upper right and emerges to the left to run up along a long purple cylinder extending from the upper left into a white spherical structure above. The lower right of this top piece of U 2 extends to a vertical band or tan cylinders to the right adjacent to a more rounded region of light red cylinders to its right.</p>

In humans, these conserved protein components are augmented by more than 200 additional proteins, which mostly participate in regulating the splicing reaction. Spliceosomes are thus among the most complex supramolecular machines in any eukaryotic cell. The RNA components of a spliceosome are the catalysts of the various splicing steps. The overall complex can be considered a highly flexible ribonucleoprotein enzyme that can adapt to the great diversity in size and sequence of nuclear pre-mRNAs.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_QqHGusA6Zj">Part a shows a white R N A structure that has a rounded top with a roughly triangular piece pointing down from the bottom, a piece extending diagonally up to the right from the place where the triangular and rounded pieces meet at the right, and a similar, shorter projection extending from the center of the rounded structure. A purple R N A labeled Domain Roman numeral r runs almost vertically up from between the triangular piece and the protrusion to the right to meet blue Domain Roman numeral 5 just above where the piece protrudes to the right. Domain Roman numeral 5 is a short piece in the center to lower right of the rounded part of the white structure. Pink E B S 1 is just above it. A green strand begins along the right side of the blue piece, bends right across the bottom of the pink piece, and ends at the right side just beneath the top white protrusion, where it is labeled 5 prime exon. Part b shows Doman Roman numeral 4 running vertically upward. One of its strands runs along the left from its midpoint up to the center, where blue and green pieces meet next to two green spheres labeled M g 2 plus. The piece to the right at this point turns blue and bends left to meet blue Doman Roman numeral 5 that runs up to the left of the M g 2 plus to form a vertical piece at the upper left. About halfway up the long purple strand of Doman Roman numeral 4, the piece that forms the left center wraps around a yellow strand and this is labeled branch point. The yellow strand runs up to the bottom of the blue piece, then bends to run to the left, where it is labeled 5 prime end of intron. The green strand begins near M g 2 plus and runs up a short distance before bending horizontally to run across the bottom of pink E B S 1, which extends vertically upward. The green strand continues to the right to end, where it is labeled 5 prime exon. A close-up labeled domain Roman numeral 5 catalytic triplex shows paired blue strands running along the lower left and upper right with a third strand running from the middle right to top. A curved strand begins above the center of this third strand and runs down, then curves around to form a loop that ends at its top center, where two lines extend down to a dashed line to a green sphere labeled M g 2 plus between the start and end points of the circular strand. Dashed lines also connect this M G to a line extending from the bottom center of the strand and to two lines extending from the lower portion of the third strand running below and up to the left. This third strand has two lines extending from its lower right that have a dashed line to a second M g that is connected by a dashed line to the same two lines extending from the lower portion of the third strand that are also connected to the first M g. This second M g is also connected to a thin line extending down from the curved strand. Part b shows the spliceosome as a large white structure consisting of a combination of cylinders and R N A. It has a rounded region in the middle with a rounded protrusion on top and a more rectangular protrusion to the lower left. Near its bottom center, a small purple U 2 curves up and then down with a yellow intron beginning at its lower left and running through it to end to the right. A blue U 6 begins at the bottom center beneath the purple curve and extends up above it slightly to the left and center. A green strand begins at the top of the purple loop and runs at a slight diagonal up to the right, where it ends in the center right of the white structure. At this point, it is labeled 5 prime exon. The exon runs across a pink U 5 that is to the right of blue U 6 and extends up slightly to the left. A close-up shows purple U 2 beginning with a loop near its bottom and then running up along the right side of a structure to curve left for a short distance before ending near the center right edge. A yellow intron begins near the bottom of U 2 and bends across it to form a loop above the purple coil in U 2. The left-hand end of the loop where the sides come together is labeled branch point. It runs up, then down again to end at the center left side beneath blue U 6, which runs to the right and then down to reach a minimum beneath the peak of the yellow intron before running up again through the yellow intro to form a blue region at the center to mid center left of the structure. Two M g 2 plus are visible in near the middle of the overall structure within this blue region. A green strand begins at these M g and runs left for a very short distance, curves to run up to the right, where it is labeled 5 prime exon. A pink region at the top that meets the top of U 2 to the lower right and meets blue U 6 to its left is labeled U 5. The green strand runs across its center. The U 6 catalytic triplex is very similar to the domain Roman numeral 5 catalytic triplex.</p>

Splicing of a pre-mRNA in the nucleus can also have profound effects on the function of the mRNA in the cytoplasm. Lynne Maquat and Melissa Moore discovered that the human spliceosome leaves behind a set of proteins on each spliced mRNA near the junction between two exons. This exon junction complex is retained on the mRNA as it is exported to the cytoplasm, where it can regulate the extent to which an mRNA can be translated over its lifetime before degradation.</p>

This editing includes processes that add or delete bases in the coding regions of primary transcripts or that change the sequence (such as by enzymatic deamination of a C residue to create a U residue). A particularly dramatic example occurs in trypanosomes, which are parasitic protists: large regions of an mRNA are synthesized without any uridylate, and the U residues are inserted later by RNA editing.</p>

In yeast, the entire process involves the pre-rRNA, more than 170 nonribosomal proteins, snoRNAs for each nucleoside modification (about 70, because some snoRNAs guide two types of modification), and the 78 ribosomal proteins. Humans have an even greater number of modified nucleosides, about 200, and a greater number of associated snoRNAs. The composition of the complexes may change as the ribosomes are assembled, and many of the intermediate complexes rival the ribosome itself in complexity. The 5S rRNA of most eukaryotes is made as a completely separate transcript by a different polymerase (Pol III).</p>

About 1,500 human genes encode miRNAs, and one or more of these miRNAs affect the expression of most protein-coding genes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pmYU9NRJGl">The miRNAs are synthesized from much larger precursors, in several steps (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_InxXYuxoBJ"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_0Sgul4sgJY" id="dav_9781319322342_rVuiLLgeXH">Fig. 26-26</a></strong>). The primary transcripts for miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) vary greatly in size; some are encoded in the introns of other genes and are coexpressed with these host genes. Processing of pri-miRNA is mediated by two endoribonucleases in the RNase III family, Drosha and Dicer. First, in the nucleus, the pri-miRNA is reduced to a 70 to 80 nucleotide precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by a protein complex including Drosha and another protein, DGCR8. The pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm in a complex with two proteins, exportin-5 and the Ran GTPase (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qcrNWrWhbz" id="dav_9781319322342_SIpjP4PNAo">Fig. 27-42</a>). In the cytoplasm, Ran hydrolyzes the GTP, then exportin-5 and the pre-miRNA are released. The pre-miRNA is then acted on by Dicer to produce the nearly mature miRNA paired with a short RNA complement. The complement is removed by an RNA helicase, and the mature miRNA is incorporated into protein complexes, such as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which then bind a target mRNA. If the complementarity between miRNA and its target is nearly perfect, the target mRNA is cleaved. If the complementarity is only partial, the complex blocks translation of the target mRNA. The roles of miRNAs and RISC in gene regulation are detailed in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_u3IxJMHSEv" id="dav_9781319322342_jSG4JxMdg3">Chapter 28</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_2er8axkI3h">Two blue horizontal lines represent double stranded D N A in the nucleus of a cell. There is a gray region in the center. Beneath this gray region, there is a green arrow pointing to the right along the length of the gray region. An arrow points down labeled blue highlighted R N A polymerase Roman numeral 2 complex and transcription. This yields p r i-m i R N A (s), which are shown as four vertical structures with loops. A strand begins with a small horizontal red piece, then turns green before bending upward to form the first vertical structure. It has a vertical region with five paired sets of bases, then forms an oval loop, then has a vertical region with three paired sets of bases, then forms another loop. The left-hand side of this loop is yellow and begins a yellow strand on the left side. Another vertical region above has three paired sets of bases and is yellow on the left and green on the right. This is followed by another loop with a yellow left side and a green right side. Above, there is another vertical region of four sets of paired bases that is yellow on the left and green on the right. Above this, the left-hand strand turns green and there is an entirely green top loop. At the lower right of this vertical structure, it has a horizontal green piece that reaches two wavy vertical lines that show a break, then there are three more identical vertical structures before the right end of the right-hand structure becomes horizontal and ends at A A A (A) subscript italicized n end italics end subscript. An arrow points down to show a complex that contains a single one of these vertical structures in the center with a small red piece at its horizontal left end and a string of A A A A A at its horizontal right end. A pink bent oval labeled Drosha covers the three central loops and a dark purple oval labeled D G C R 8 beneath covers the bottom center of the structure with the horizontal pieces of the strand extending out to the left and right. An arrow labeled cleavage points down and is joined by an arrow from the left that forms the top part of a cycle of arrows. This left-hand arrow begins in the cytoplasm at an orange oval bonded to G D P below with a rectangular cutout in its top into which a light orange structure fits that has a rectangular base and then a curved portion that extends out to the upper left and right. This is at the seven o’clock position of the circle of arrows. An arrow points up from this structure into the nucleus accompanied by a curved arrow showing the loss of G D P and a curved line showing the addition of G T P. This joins the arrow labeled cleavage to yield a structure that includes a vertical piece of pre- m i R N A. The bottom part of the vertical structure is gone, so it has only two central loops and one top loop. The left side ends at the end of the yellow piece at the bottom of the bottom loop, which formerly had a green loop beneath, and the right side has a short vertical green strand that extends beneath the bottom loop. This structure has its bottom loop in a dark orange oval bonded to G T P below and its middle loop in the light orange green piece above. The complex is labeled exportin-5 and R a n. An arrow points down across the nuclear envelop and is labeled export. An arrow branches off to show the loss of P subscript i end subscript. A second arrow branches off to show exportin-5 and R a n bound to G D P at the seven o’clock position of the circle of arrows, ready to repeat the cycle. The third arrow points down to the pre- m I R N A within a light blue oval wider and flatter at the top than at the bottom labeled dicer. Only the top of the top green circle is visible above. Arrows point to the place where the top of the yellow strand meets the base of the top green circle and to the middle of the right-hand side of the top vertical paired region. An arrow labeled cleavage points down and to the left. An arrow labeled blue highlighted R N A helicase points down and to the left. This yields a structure that is horizontal with the two halves partially separated. The top strand is yellow and the bottom strand is green. There is a paired horizontal piece on the right, then a circle, then two horizontal pieces that have been pulled apart, then a circle that had been at the bottom before that has been pulled farther apart. An arrow labeled R I S C loading points down to a purple oval containing a yellow strand with very short green lines extending down labeled mature m i R N A. An arrow points down labeled target selection and splits in half. The top half points to a structure labeled near-perfect complementarity. This contains a yellow m R N A with a loop near the right side bonded to a dark green strand below with a red tip outside of the purple oval to the left and a right end that joins to A A A (A) subscript italicized n end italics). An arrow points from this to show a green strand with a red left end and a short yellow strand with A A A (A) subscript italicized n end italics end subscript at its right side. An arrow pointing downward is labeled m R N A cleavage and this yields many small green and yellow fragments. The second arrow from target selection points to a product labeled partial complementarity. This is similar to near-perfect complementarity except that there are two loops in the yellow strand that do not pair to the green strand below. An arrow points down to show the same structure above and arrow pointing down to text reading, translational expression. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_PZiYDL2OcZ">The expression of genes is regulated at many levels. A crucial factor governing a gene’s expression is the cellular concentration of its associated mRNA. The concentration of any molecule depends on two factors: its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation. When synthesis and degradation of an mRNA are balanced, the concentration of the mRNA remains in a steady state. A change in either rate will lead to net accumulation or depletion of the mRNA. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Bk0ntAsdbB" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01b.png"/> Degradative pathways ensure that mRNAs do not build up in the cell and direct the synthesis of unnecessary proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_URSTDZVYWl">The rates of degradation vary greatly for mRNAs from different eukaryotic genes. For a gene product that is needed only briefly, the half-life of its mRNA may be only minutes or even seconds. Gene products needed <span aria-label="987" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page987" role="doc-pagebreak"/>constantly by the cell may have mRNAs that are stable over many cell generations. The average half-life of the mRNAs of a vertebrate cell is about 3 hours, with the pool of each type of mRNA turning over about 10 times per cell generation. The half-life of bacterial mRNAs is much shorter — only about 1.5 min — perhaps because of regulatory requirements.</p>

A yellow rounded exosome core is below with a gray nuclease visible extending below the yellow exosome core and with a diagonal gray piece labeled nuclease to the right. An R N A substrate is shown as a vertical green molecule that begins near the top of the R N A helicase and runs downward into A T P ase. A dashed line runs almost vertically down through the rest of the A T P ase and exosome core, where it forms a more standard R N A structure as it continues down into the nuclease, where it bends horizontally. Part b shows a purple rounded rectangular structure with a portion that bends up diagonally to the right at the top. This is labeled R N A helicase. Beneath, a rounded pink structure is labeled A T P ase. A taller structure below labeled exosome core is yellow and roughly cylindrical with a wider top than bottom. A blue rounded piece with a smaller rounded top to the upper right with a circle in is it labeled nuclease. A vertical cylinder extends from near the top of R N A helicase down into A T P ase, narrowing toward the bottom. It joins an more irregularly-shaped piece in the exosome core that is rounded at the top, then bends to the right and then upward into the nuclease. A green R N A substrate is shown vertically above and running through this passageway through the parts of the structure.</p>
