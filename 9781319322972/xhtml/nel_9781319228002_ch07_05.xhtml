For example, ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing serum glycoprotein, has several oligosaccharide chains ending in Neu5Ac. The mechanism that removes sialic acid residues from serum glycoproteins is unclear. It may be due to the activity of the enzyme neuraminidase (also called sialidase) produced by invading organisms or to a steady, slow release of the residues by extracellular enzymes. The plasma membrane of hepatocytes has lectin molecules (asialoglycoprotein receptors; “asialo-” indicating “without sialic acid”) that specifically bind oligosaccharide chains with galactose residues no longer “protected” by a terminal Neu5Ac residue. Receptor-ceruloplasmin interaction triggers endocytosis and destruction of the ceruloplasmin.</p>

Near a site of inflammation, stronger interactions between integrin in the leukocyte surface and its ligand in the capillary surface lead to tight adhesion.

Larger Y-shaped structures project from the epithelial cells and are labeled P selectin. A leukocyte is shown as a sphere at the upper left.

Evenly spaced between the paired integrins, small rods extend out to small spheres and are labeled glycoprotein ligand for P selectin. Two steps, tethering and rolling, occur under the heading selectin binding. Tethering: An arrow shows that the leukocyte moves down and one of the yellow spheres inserts into the fork of P selectin. Rolling: An arrow shows that the bound leukocyte rotates clockwise. The next two steps, slow rolling and arrest, are shown under the heading integrin binding. In slow rolling, an arrow shows that the leukocyte rotates further clockwise so that the glycoprotein ligand leaves P selectin and two heads of a pair of integrins attach to a glycoprotein ligand for integrin. A second pair of integrin heads attach to an adjacent glycoprotein ligand for binding, causing the cell to stretch so it is narrower at this location. Arrest: The cell is circular again with a pair of integrins bound to a glycoprotein ligand on each side of a glycoprotein bound to P selectin at the bottom center of the molecule. Two additional steps are shown without a heading. Adhesion: the leukocyte extends into an irregular shape with one narrow end. The bottom of the cell pushes into the endothelial cell. Extravasation: the cell pushes between two endothelial cells. It is narrow between the cells and rounded beneath, where it extends into a reddened semicircle labeled site of inflammation.</p>

Many carcinomas express sialyl Lewis x, which, when shed into the circulation, facilitates tumor cell survival and metastasis. Carbohydrate derivatives that mimic the sialyl Lewis x portion of sialoglycoproteins and compete for specific selectin-binding sites, or that alter the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide, might prove effective as selectin-specific drugs for treating chronic inflammation or metastatic disease.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_0KYFBAbVeL">Several animal viruses, including the influenza virus, attach to their host cells through interactions with oligosaccharides displayed on the host cell surface. The lectin of the influenza virus, known as the HA (hemagglutinin) protein, is essential for viral entry and infection. After the virus has entered a host cell and has been replicated, the newly synthesized viral particles bud out of the cell, wrapped in a portion of its plasma membrane. A viral sialidase (neuraminidase) trims the terminal sialic acid residue from the host cell’s oligosaccharides, releasing the viral particles from their interaction with the cell and preventing their aggregation with one another. Another round of infection can now begin. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are used clinically in the treatment of influenza. These drugs are sugar analogs; they inhibit the viral sialidase by competing with the host cell’s oligosaccharides for binding (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_7dELcsTVrh"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_5wym3EoJGe" id="dav_9781319322342_BP04rB8mbh">Fig. 7-30</a></strong>). This prevents the release of viruses from the infected cell by sialidase, and also causes viral particles to aggregate, both of which block another cycle of infection.</p>

Glycans are far more information-dense than nucleic acids or proteins.</li>

Receptor/lectins in the surface of hepatocytes recognize glycoproteins that have lost their terminal sialic acid residue and mediate the normal uptake (by hepatocytes) and destruction of blood cells and of certain circulating glycoprotein hormones.</li>

Interactions are often polyvalent.</li>
