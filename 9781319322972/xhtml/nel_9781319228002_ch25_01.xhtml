<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_AcMx7BCJQK">As the repository of genetic information, DNA occupies a unique and central place among biological macromolecules. The nucleotide sequences of DNA encode the primary structures of all cellular RNAs and proteins and, through enzymes, indirectly affect the synthesis of all other cellular constituents. This passage of information from DNA to RNA and protein guides the size, shape, and functioning of every living thing.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_DsODJJf22B">DNA is a marvelous device for the stable storage of genetic information. The phrase “stable storage,” however, conveys a static and misleading picture. It fails to capture the complexity of processes by which genetic information is preserved in an uncorrupted state and then transmitted from one generation of cells to the next. DNA metabolism comprises both the process that gives rise to faithful copies of DNA molecules (replication) and the processes that affect the inherent structure of the information (repair and recombination). Together, these activities are both the focus of this chapter and the underpinning for several guiding principles:</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_dufKarNxJe">Before taking a closer look at replication, we make a short digression into the use of abbreviations in naming genes and proteins — you will encounter many of these in this and later chapters. Bacterial genes generally are named using three italicized, lowercase letters that often reflect a gene’s apparent function. For example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_KDqZW2Ob0z">dna, uvr</i>, and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_tJ2j3wwb73">rec</i> genes affect <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_V0V5fcX7sR">DNA</i> replication, resistance to the damaging effects of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_F9vU04zKeH">UV r</i>adiation, and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_wuM7m41vgd">rec</i>ombination, respectively. Where several genes affect the same process, the letters <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_vb0fSkiVjj">A</i>, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_EgjJuUNITz">B</i>, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_xlx060OniL">C</i>, and so forth, are added — as in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_L2rPW3JPBg">dnaA</i>, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_le1vCPKCc1">dnaB</i>, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_RTbhfJeAJs">dnaQ</i>, for example — usually reflecting their order of discovery rather than the order of their gene products in a reaction sequence. Similar conventions exist for naming eukaryotic genes, although the exact form of the abbreviations may vary with the species, and no single convention applies to all eukaryotic systems. For example, in the budding yeast <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_5vc88cp4n1">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, gene names are generally three uppercase letters followed by a number, all italicized (e.g., the gene <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_LxGdNTUCXR">COX1</i> encodes a subunit of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_QLKQtrqJ9M">c</i>ytochrome <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_pJGJKqBsWZ">ox</i>idase). Gene names that predate current conventions may differ in format.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_0gPLQTMy4W">The use of abbreviations in naming proteins is less straightforward. During genetic investigations, the protein product of each gene is usually isolated and characterized. Many bacterial genes were identified and named before the roles of their protein products were understood in detail. Sometimes the gene product was found to be a previously isolated protein, and some renaming <span aria-label="915" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page915" role="doc-pagebreak"/>occurred. Often, however, the product turned out to be an as yet unknown protein, with an activity not easily described by a simple enzyme name.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pbcrbTkWeg">Bacterial proteins often retain the name of their genes. When referring to the protein product of an <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_mfvacCqw2W">E. coli</i> gene, we use roman type and capitalize the first letter: for example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_R1fxrawzAa">dnaA</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_erfMWN6O7r">recA</i> gene products are the DnaA and RecA proteins, respectively. Conventions for eukaryotic proteins are again complex. For yeast, some proteins have long common names (such as cytochrome oxidase). Others have the same name as the gene, in which case the protein name usually has one uppercase and two lowercase letters, followed by a number and the letter “p,” all in roman type (such as Rad51p). The “p” is to emphasize that this is a protein and to prevent confusion with naming conventions for other organisms. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_GfOgckke9O" role="presentation" src="../images/square.png"/></p>
