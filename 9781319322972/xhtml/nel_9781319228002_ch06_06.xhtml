<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Vidu5tB4bq">In cellular metabolism, groups of enzymes work together in sequential pathways to carry out a given metabolic process, such as the multireaction breakdown of glucose to lactate or the multireaction synthesis of an amino acid from simpler precursors. Each separate reaction is catalyzed by a different enzyme. In such enzyme systems, the reaction product of one enzyme becomes the substrate of the next. This functional compartmentalization of cellular chemistry does more than accelerate individual reactions; it provides opportunities for the exquisitely precise regulation of all cellular processes.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LxfcsE9X38">The properties of allosteric enzymes are significantly different from those of simple nonregulatory enzymes. Some of the differences are structural. In addition to active sites, allosteric enzymes often have one or more regulatory, or allosteric, sites for binding to each heterotropic modulator (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_O4DoWTjdwZ"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_4pCmZxSHXv" id="dav_9781319322342_qppmeihwMC">Fig. 6-35</a></strong>). Just as an enzyme’s active site is specific for its substrate, each regulatory site is specific for its modulator. Enzymes with several modulators generally have different specific binding sites for each. In homotropic enzymes, the active site and regulatory site are the same.</p>

Binding of the positive (stimulatory) modulator (M) to its specific site on the regulatory subunit is communicated to the catalytic subunit through a conformational change. This change renders the catalytic subunit active and capable of binding the substrate (S) with higher affinity. Upon dissociation of the modulator from the regulatory subunit, the enzyme reverts to its inactive or less-active form.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_S0sfS3bMn3">All of the graphs show concentration of substrate in millimolar on the horizontal axis and V subscript 0 in micromolar per minute on the vertical axis. All of the curves begin at the origin. All data are approximate. Part a shows three curves. A dotted horizontal line labeled V subscript max runs across the graph at about seven-eighths of the height of the vertical axis. The first curve, labeled high activity R state, runs along the vertical axis at first, then begins to bend away as it approaches half the height of the vertical axis. It bends away slowly until about one-eighth of the length of the horizontal axis, then levels off more rapidly and becomes almost horizontal beneath the dotted horizontal line labeled V subscript max by about three-quarters of the length of the horizontal axis. It continues at this level to the right of the graph. The second two curves begin together. The unlabeled curve begins to rise relatively rapidly by about one-eighth of the length of the horizontal axis and passes through a point labeled one-half V subscript max. A dotted horizontal line extends to this point from slightly below half the height of the vertical axis and half of the distance to the dotted line labeled V subscript max. A dotted vertical line extends down to a point on the horizontal axis labeled K subscript 0.5 at about one-quarter of the length of the horizontal axis. The line continues to rise rapidly, then begins to level off at about two-thirds of the height of the vertical axis and a bit over one-third of the length of the horizontal axis. It rapidly levels off and joins the high activity R state curve for the last third of the horizontal axis. The third curve, labeled low-activity T state, begins along with the middle, unlabeled curve but continues almost diagonally until just below half the height of the vertical axis and just past half the distance of the horizontal axis. It rises slightly more gradually to end just above the midpoint of the vertical axis at the right side of the graph. Part b shows seven curves. K subscript 0.5 and the horizontal line for V subscript max are both at the same position as in the previous graph. A central, black curve appears to be the same as the unlabeled curve in part a. A blue arrow points to the left of K subscript 0.5 to a blue highlighted K subscript 0.5 superscript circled plus sign at the far left of the horizontal axis. A red line points from K subscript 0.5 to a red highlighted K subscript 0.5 superscript circled minus sign at about three quarters of the length of the horizontal axis. The curves are increasingly blue as they move from the central curve to the left and are increasingly red as they move from the central curve to the right. The far left curve, which is blue, rises very rapidly and then begins to level off right after passing through a circled plus sign just past half the height of the vertical axis and at about one-sixteenth of the length of the vertical axis. A blue arrow points to this plus sign from the central black curve. The blue curve begins to level off and runs almost horizontally beneath the dotted horizontal line labeled V subscript max on the right quarter of the graph until the right end of the graph. A dotted vertical line and dotted horizontal line intersect on the curve at slightly less than one-sixteenth of the length of the vertical axis and just under half of the height of the vertical axis. The vertical line goes down to the blue K subscript 0.5 superscript circled plus sign. The dotted horizontal line runs straight through all of the curves until the last, red curve, when it meets a vertical line that extends down to red K subscript 0.5 superscript red circled minus sign. Each curve has its own dotted vertical line. There are two curves in between the black central curve and the blue curve representing intermediates. Beginning with the one just to the right of the blue curve, each runs slightly longer along the black curve before rising slightly to the right of the previous curve and then joins with the others horizontally slightly earlier. Each has a K subscript 0.5 slightly to the right of the previous curve. There are also three increasingly red curves to the right of the central black curve. All run along the black curve until about one-quarter of the length of the horizontal axis, then they split. The far right curve, in red, rises almost diagonally and then slightly begins to level off by just below half of the height of the vertical axis and just past half of the length of the horizontal axis, approximately where a circled red minus is shown on the line. A red arrow points from the central black curve to this red minus. The curve is met by a dotted horizontal line and a dotted vertical line at just below half of the height of the vertical axis and about three-quarters of the length of the horizontal axis. The line ends just above the midpoint on the vertical axis at the far right side of the graph. The two lines between it and the black central line all begin together and then spread out to be approximately evenly spaced. The middle two end at the right side of the graph evenly spaced on the vertical axis between the red line and the central black line. Part c shows three curves. The black curve rises gradually until about half of the distance of the horizontal axis and about a third of the height of the vertical axis, then levels off rapidly and becomes increasingly horizontal before ending at just below half the height of the vertical axis on the right side of the graph. It ends slightly below a black dotted horizontal line labeled V subscript max. A blue curve begins to rise more rapidly and reaches a circled plus sign at just over half the height of the vertical axis and about half of the length of the horizontal axis. It then rises more slowly and ends at about three-quarters of the height of the vertical axis at the right side of the graph. It is below a dotted horizontal line labeled blue V subscript max that is near the top of the graph. A red line begins to rise more slowly than the other two and passes through a point where two dotted lines meet at a point over one-third and less than one-half of the length of the horizontal axis. A dotted horizontal line extends to this point from the vertical axis, and a dotted vertical line extends down to the horizontal axis at a point labeled K subscript 0.5 The red line continues through a circled red minus sign at a point slightly less than one-third of the height of the vertical axis and just past half of the length of the horizontal axis. It continues almost horizontally to end at just below one-third of the height of the vertical axis at the right side of the graph, just before a dotted line labeled red V subscript max. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_tjkUOeoPkl">In another important class of regulatory enzymes, activity is modulated by covalent modification of one or more of the amino acid residues in the enzyme molecule. Over 500 different types of covalent modification have been found in proteins. Common modifying groups include phosphoryl, acetyl, adenylyl, uridylyl, methyl, amide, carboxyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, prenyl, hydroxyl, sulfate, and adenosine diphosphate ribosyl groups (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Urd5PTyizA"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GTQwLTnAVM" id="dav_9781319322342_kxJt0R74zo">Fig. 6-38</a></strong>). There are even entire proteins that function as specialized modifying groups. These include ubiquitin and SUMO (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_9BDcJDpgob">s</i>mall <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_T96eIgaQUG">u</i>biquitin-like <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_eawV0wartw">mo</i>difier), which are attached and detached from other proteins to regulate their activity in some way. All of these groups, small and large, are linked to and removed from a regulated enzyme by separate enzymes. When an amino acid residue in an enzyme is modified, a novel amino acid with altered properties has effectively been introduced into the enzyme. Introduction of a charge can alter the local properties of the enzyme and induce a change in conformation. Introduction of a hydrophobic group can trigger association with a membrane. The changes are often substantial and can be critical to the function of the altered enzyme.</p>

One enzyme that is regulated by methylation is the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein of bacteria. This protein is part of a system that permits a bacterium to swim toward an attractant (such as a sugar) in solution and away from repellent chemicals. The methylating agent is <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_qvYYEx5tBF">S</i>-adenosylmethionine (adoMet) (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_MRk8kPo3be" id="dav_9781319322342_BNV3V6O9mv">Fig. 18-18</a>). Acetylation is another common modification, with approximately 80% of the soluble proteins in eukaryotes, including many enzymes, acetylated at their amino terminus. Ubiquitin is added to proteins as a tag that destines them for proteolytic degradation (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ja3gxMEN59" id="dav_9781319322342_Z0yAYyuLkU">Fig. 27-47</a>).

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_OAjKBp2xy2">ADP-ribosylation is an especially interesting reaction; the ADP-ribose is derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_sNx8CAIJvW" id="dav_9781319322342_4VZC30yTpO">Fig. 8-41</a>). This type of modification occurs for the bacterial enzyme dinitrogenase reductase, resulting in regulation of the important process of biological nitrogen fixation. Diphtheria toxin and cholera toxin are enzymes that catalyze the ADP-ribosylation (and inactivation) of key cellular enzymes or other proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_dvFJnZwXzG">By far the most common type of regulatory modification is phosphorylation. About one-third of all proteins in a eukaryotic cell are phosphorylated, and one or (often) many phosphorylation events are part of virtually every regulatory process. Some proteins have only one <span aria-label="217" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" role="doc-pagebreak"/>phosphorylated residue, others have several, and a few have dozens of sites for phosphorylation. This mode of covalent modification is central to a large number of regulatory pathways. We discuss it in some detail here, and again in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_puAdTsYtlu" id="dav_9781319322342_CUJhrA3K26">Chapter 12</a>.</p>

This introduces a bulky, charged group into a region of the target protein that was only moderately polar prior to modification. The oxygen atoms of a phosphoryl group can hydrogen-bond with one or several groups in a protein, commonly the amide groups of the peptide backbone at the start of an <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_M8gaYCABeL">α</i> helix or the charged guanidinium group of an Arg residue.

However, amino acid sequence is not the only important factor in determining whether a given residue will be phosphorylated. Protein folding brings together residues that are distant in the primary sequence; the resulting three-dimensional structure can determine whether a protein kinase has access to a given residue and can recognize it as a substrate.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_quuDWlJx0j">Regulation by phosphorylation is often complicated. Some proteins have consensus sequences recognized by several different protein kinases, each of which can phosphorylate the protein and alter its enzymatic activity. In some cases, phosphorylation is hierarchical: a certain residue can be phosphorylated only if a neighboring residue has already been phosphorylated. For example, glycogen synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of glucose monomers to form glycogen (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch15_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RhTVDMh7D5" id="dav_9781319322342_BD31wFpXNr">Chapter 15</a>), is inactivated by phosphorylation of specific Ser residues and is also modulated by at least four other protein kinases that phosphorylate four other sites in the enzyme (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_kSbmxIquVH"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_uA9ZUrd5gA" id="dav_9781319322342_KgPrv0ccpK">Fig. 6-41</a></strong>). The enzyme does not become a <span aria-label="220" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page220" role="doc-pagebreak"/>substrate for glycogen synthase kinase 3 until one site has been phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Some phosphorylations inhibit glycogen synthase more than others, and some combinations of phosphorylations are cumulative.

Another green arrow from thrombin points left and then splits into two halves, each accompanied by a green triangle in a circle with an arrow to the circle from thrombomodulin. The left arrow points to highlighted protein C, and the right arrow points to protein S. Protein C and protein S are added together. Two red arrows extend from the plus sign between them to two red circles with Xs, one beneath Roman numeral 8 lowercase A and one beneath Roman numeral 5 lowercase A. Roman numeral 8 lowercase A is converted to Roman numeral 8 lowercase A by an arrow indicated by a green arrow from highlighted thrombin and next to a green triangle in a circle. An arrow points from Roman numeral 8 lowercase A to the reaction from Roman numeral 10 to Roman numeral 10 lowercase A. The reaction from Roman numeral 5 to Roman numeral 5 lowercase A also has an arrow pointing to it from highlighted thrombin accompanied by a green triangle in a circle. A green arrow accompanied by a green triangle in a circle points from Roman numeral 5 lowercase A to the arrow from Roman numeral 10 lowercase A with C lowercase A 2 plus that points down to the reaction that converts prothrombin to thrombin.</p>

Tissue damage exposes the blood plasma to TF embedded largely in the membranes of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells beneath the endothelial layer.

Factor VII is converted to its active form, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_qf5oHAWJlv">factor VIIa</dfn>, by proteolytic cleavage catalyzed by <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_PVUGad7dKD">factor Xa</dfn> (another serine protease). The TF-VIIa complex then cleaves <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_Kaip5uGLZR">factor X</dfn>, creating the active form, factor Xa.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_7jNEUT2ZQ7">If TF-VIIa is needed to cleave X, and Xa is needed to cleave TF-VII, how does the process ever get started? A very small amount of factor VIIa is present in the blood at all times, enough to form a small amount of the active TF-VIIa complex immediately after tissue is damaged. This allows formation of factor Xa and establishes the initiating feedback loop. Once levels of factor Xa begin to build up, Xa (in a complex with another regulatory protein, factor Va) cleaves prothrombin to form active thrombin, and thrombin cleaves fibrinogen.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_uZIZG8qBPc">The extrinsic pathway thus provides a burst of thrombin. However, the TF-VIIa complex is quickly shut down by the protein <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_QKdsgQwfTN">tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)</dfn>.

Factor IXa, in a complex with the regulatory protein <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_DFwmBXGUXE">VIIIa</dfn>, is relatively stable and provides an alternative enzyme for the proteolytic conversion of factor X to Xa.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZaPx1InAku">Left uncontrolled, blood coagulation could eventually lead to blockage of blood vessels, causing heart attacks or strokes. More regulation is thus needed. As a hard clot forms, regulatory pathways are already acting to limit the time during which the coagulation cascade is active. In addition to cleaving fibrinogen, thrombin forms a complex with a protein embedded in the vascular surface of endothelial cells, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_odwWKoPx2A">thrombomodulin</dfn>. The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex cleaves the serine protease zymogen <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_ZosgvZBUzZ">protein C</dfn>. Activated protein C, in a complex with the regulatory <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_GnRJ63pyVt">protein S</dfn>, cleaves and inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, leading to suppression of the overall cascade. Another protein, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_aFa3Qipkro">antithrombin III (ATIII)</dfn>, is a serine protease inhibitor. ATIII makes a covalent 1:1 complex between an Arg residue on ATIII and the active-site Ser residue of serine proteases, particularly thrombin and factor Xa. These two regulatory systems, in concert with TFPI, help to establish a threshold or level of exposure to TF that is needed to activate the coagulation cascade. Individuals with genetic defects that eliminate or decrease levels of protein C or ATIII in the blood have a greatly elevated risk of thrombosis (inappropriate formation of blood clots).</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_3iLBKbh8CB"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_G2BUoAVnph" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_IC_pg_37.png"/> The control of blood coagulation has important roles in medicine, particularly in the prevention of blood clotting during surgery and in patients at risk for heart attacks or strokes. Several different medical approaches to anticoagulation are available. The first takes advantage of another feature of several proteins in the coagulation cascade that we have not yet considered. The factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin, along with proteins C and S, have calcium-binding sites that are critical to their function. In each case, the calcium-binding sites are formed by modification of multiple Glu residues near the amino terminus of each protein to <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_zQb80TNZ0M">γ-carboxyglutamate</dfn> residues (abbreviated <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_9R3KvYcQyv">Gla</strong>; <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_02.xhtml#page76" id="dav_9781319322342_lQwTnHEPfQ">p. 76</a>). The Glu-to-Gla modifications are carried out by enzymes that depend on the function of the fat-soluble vitamin K (p. 359). Bound calcium functions to adhere these proteins to the anionic phospholipids that appear on the surface of activated platelets, effectively localizing the coagulation factors to the area where the clot is to form. Vitamin K antagonists such as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_WCuKpNGdbr">warfarin</dfn> (Coumadin) have proven highly effective as anticoagulants. A second approach to anticoagulation is the administration of heparins. <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_XSIp2oyrZZ">Heparins</dfn> are highly sulfated polysaccharides (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_VMlqcvARrC" id="dav_9781319322342_YFpuwiURlS">Fig. 7-19</a>). They act as anticoagulants by increasing the affinity of ATIII for factor Xa and thrombin, thus facilitating the inactivation of key cascade elements (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_MTgiW2UO63" id="dav_9781319322342_PyjJp6WTVi">Figs 7-23</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_gbD8pWLxf5" id="dav_9781319322342_RzeG73IGry">7-24</a>). Finally, <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_JNqPsRNANH">aspirin</dfn> (acetylsalicylate; <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_sK8wJBxT45" id="dav_9781319322342_sorTbZ8yzv">Fig. 21-15b</a>) is effective as an anticoagulant. Aspirin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, required for the production of thromboxanes. As aspirin reduces thromboxane release from platelets, the capacity of the platelets to aggregate declines.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_1f5hHY0iW3">Humans born with a deficiency in any one of most components of the clotting cascade have an increased tendency to bleed that varies from mild to essentially uncontrollable, a fatal condition. Genetic defects in the genes encoding the proteins required for blood clotting result in diseases referred to as hemophilias. Hemophilia B is a sex-linked trait resulting from a deficiency in factor IX. This type of hemophilia affects about one in 25,000 males worldwide. The most famous example of the inheritance <span aria-label="223" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page223" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of hemophilia B occurred among European royalty. Queen Victoria (1819–1901) was evidently a carrier. Prince Leopold, her eighth child, suffered from hemophilia B and died at the age of 31 after a minor fall. At least two of her daughters were carriers and passed the defective gene to other royal families of Europe (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_aO0nJCI3R8"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_q5ek7dYEJ9" id="dav_9781319322342_TWFOq2HV5I">Fig. 6-45</a></strong>). <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_uJGv63hII3" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>

Open square equals normal male, open circle equals normal female; red square equals hemophiliac male; half red circle equals carrier female; tan square equals possible hemophiliac male; half tan circle equals possible carrier female. The top of the pedigree shows an open square connected by a horizontal line to a half red circle labeled Victoria. A short vertical line extends down to a horizontal line running almost the full length of the figure. Nine vertical lines extend down from this top line representing descendants. At the far left, a vertical line extends down to an open square connected by horizontal line to an open circle. A vertical line extending down from the horizontal line between them connects to a horizontal line to which their descendants are connected by vertical lines. Their descendants are shown are an open circle and an open square. A vertical line extending down from the open square connects to a horizontal line with two short vertical lines extending down to two open squares. The right open square has a line extending down to a horizontal line from which short vertical lines connect to two open circles. The right-hand circle is labeled Elizabeth and is connected to an open square labeled Philip. Text to the right reads, British royal family. A vertical line down from the line connecting Elizabeth and Philip has four vertical lines extending down to an open square labeled Charles, an open circle labeled Anne, an open square labeled Andrew, and an open square labeled Edward. Going back to the top main horizontal line representing descendants of Victoria, the second vertical line extends down to a half-tan circle that is connected horizontally to an open square. A vertical line extends down to a horizontal line from which four vertical lines connect to squares. Two squares are tan and two are open. One open square connects by a bent line to a half-red square labeled Irene from another lineage. Going back to the main horizontal line representing descendants of Victoria, the next vertical line extends down to a half-red circle labeled Alice that is connected horizontally to a white square. Six vertical lines extend down to three open circles, one red square labeled Fred, and two half-red circles labeled Irene and Alix. Irene is connected with a white square from the previous lineage, as already described, and a vertical line extends down to a horizontal line with three vertical lines to descendants: a red square labeled Waldemar, a white square, and a red square labeled Henry. The half-red circle labeled Alix is connected to an open square and a line extends down to a horizontal line with five vertical lines to descendants labeled Russian imperial family. These descendants include four half-tan circles and one red square labeled Alexis. Going back to the top horizontal line and the immediate descendants of Victoria, there are two open squares and two open circles with no further offspring, then a red square labeled Leopold that is joined with an open circle. A line extends down to the horizontal line linking their offspring, an open square and a half-red square labeled Alice. Alice is linked to an open square and a vertical line extends down to a horizontal line linking three descendants. Their descendants include a red square labeled Rupert, a white square, and a half-tan circle that is connected to an open square with a vertical line leading to three descendants of this pairing: an open square and two open circles. Going back to the original horizontal line of descendants of Victoria, the final vertical line leads to a half-red circle labeled Beatrice connected to an open square. A vertical line extends down to a horizontal line with four descendants: one open square, a red square labeled Leopold, a red square labeled Maurice, and a half-red square labeled Eugenie. Eugenie is connected to an open square and a vertical line extends down to a horizontal line of six descendants labeled Spanish royal family. The descendants include a red square labeled Alfonso, a tan square, an open square, two half-tan circles, a red square labeled Gonzalo, and an open square that is paired with an open circle with a line extending down to a single open square offspring. Vertical lines extend down from both half-tan circles. The line from the first extends down to a horizontal line linking two open circles and one open square.

If all possible reactions in a cell were catalyzed simultaneously, macromolecules and metabolites would quickly be broken down to much simpler chemical forms. Instead, cells catalyze only the reactions they need at a given moment. When chemical resources are plentiful, cells synthesize and store glucose and other metabolites. When chemical resources are scarce, cells use these stores to fuel cellular metabolism. Chemical energy is used economically, parceled out to various metabolic pathways as cellular needs dictate. The availability of powerful catalysts, each specific for a given reaction, makes the regulation of these reactions possible. This, in turn, gives rise to the complex, highly regulated symphony we call life.</p>
