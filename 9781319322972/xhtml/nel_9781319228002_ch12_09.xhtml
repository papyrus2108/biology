<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_pa7f1hjMlM">One of the most dramatic manifestations of signaling pathways is the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. During embryonic growth and later development, cell division occurs in virtually every tissue. In the adult organism, cells of most tissues stop dividing, becoming quiescent. A cell’s “decision” to divide or not is of crucial importance to the organism. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_fi6YEGOo8J" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_12_PG230f.png"/> When the regulatory mechanisms that limit cell division are defective and cells undergo unregulated division, the result is catastrophic — cancer. Proper cell division requires a precisely ordered sequence of biochemical events that assures every daughter cell a full complement of the molecules required for life. Investigations into the control of cell division in diverse eukaryotic cells have revealed universal regulatory mechanisms. Signaling mechanisms much like those discussed above are central in determining whether and when a cell undergoes cell division, and they also ensure orderly passage through the stages of the cell cycle.</p>

The kinases are heterodimers with a regulatory subunit, a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_WQKPmRK3Gv"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_78UyHvR0vT" id="dav_9781319322342_Vtyzg5uTkZ" role="doc-glossref">cyclin</a></dfn>, and a catalytic subunit, a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_g7IDvmaWIV">cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK)</dfn>. In the absence of the cyclin, the catalytic subunit is virtually inactive. When the cyclin binds, the catalytic site opens up, a residue essential to catalysis becomes accessible, and the protein kinase activity of the catalytic subunit increases 10,000-fold. Animal cells have at least 10 different cyclins (designated A, B, and so forth) and at least 8 CDKs (CDK1 through CDK8), which act in various combinations at specific points in the cell cycle.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qevnrnc9FN">In a population of animal cells undergoing synchronous division, some CDK activities show striking oscillations (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_Pl8vUdgw63"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_09.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_hnVlEhxKIs" id="dav_9781319322342_qQUSKpHHUA">Fig. 12-36</a></strong>). These oscillations are the result of four mechanisms for regulating CDK activity: phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the CDK, controlled degradation of the cyclin subunit, periodic synthesis of CDKs and cyclins, and the action of specific CDK-inhibiting proteins. The precisely timed activation and inactivation of a series of CDKs produces signals serving as a master clock that orchestrates the events in normal cell division and ensures that one stage is completed before the next begins.</p>

Along the upper right of the left-hand sphere, there is a green helix that runs at a slight diagonal from the upper left of the right side of the sphere to its lower right, near the upper center of the sphere. This green helix is labeled amino-terminal helix and has a green wireframe model representing G l u superscript 51 that extends from its right center into the opening between the two halves above the center of the protein. Beneath the right end of the green helix, there is a light blue wireframe model containing a sphere that is labeled T y r superscript 15. White threads extend to the lower left and lower right from the left end of T y r superscript 15. A red thread begins above the red piece at the right end of T y r superscript 15, loops over the red piece at the right end of T y r superscript 16, loops to the left next to the left end of T y r superscript 15, and then runs back to the right in front of the upper part of a roughly spherical yellow space-filling model of A T P before looping down slightly to form a T loop just to the right of the center of the molecule before ending. Part b shows the surface contour of a protein with a roughly oval cyclin subunit on top and a roughly oval C D K (inactive) below. The two pieces are joined at the left and center, leaving a small space between the left and center pieces and an opening between them on the right side. A green helix is present in the opening between the upper left and center pieces of the subunits and is angled slightly down to the right as it extends away from the viewer. A green wireframe piece labeled G l u superscript 51 extends slightly to the left below it, where it is near the red end of a light blue wireframe structure labeled T y r superscript 15 that has a white piece extending down almost to a roughly spherical yellow space-filling model of A T P below. A red strand begins in the upper right center of the bottom subunit and runs up to just to the right of the green helix, at which point it forms a loop that runs up from the bottom subunit toward the upper right and into the top subunit. Part c, labeled C D K 2 (active) has a similar structure to the protein in part b except that the T y r superscript 15 and the T loop have changed orientation and a phosphate is attached to the T loop.

The green helix also has a green wireframe model labeled G l u superscript 51 extending down past a red piece at the end of the light blue T y r and behind the yellow spheres of A T P below. The red strand begins to the right of the yellow spheres of A T P, loops slightly toward the G l u superscript 51, then runs up behind the phosphorylated T h r superscript 160, then loops up over a blue helix of the upper subunit that runs from the lower left to upper right, then curves almost vertically along a vertical white helix with the phosphorylated T h r superscript 160 shown as a wireframe with a phosphate that extends from this vertical portion toward the left. The top diagonal helix of the upper subunit has the beginning of another diagonal subunit near its upper left side and the white vertical helix has another vertical helix to its right.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_wcmDIUO16S">The steps are shown in a cycle with the top half labeled part a and the bottom half labeled part b. Part a begins with a blue rectangle labeled C D K at the boundary between the top and bottom halves. Step 1: No cyclin present; C D K is inactive. A light red structure that resembles an oval with flat sides labeled cyclin is added to an arrow pointing up and then right. Step 2: Cyclin synthesis leads to its accumulation. A blue rectangle labeled C D K at the top center of the cycle has cyclin fitted into a concavity on its lower side and a wedge labeled T y r at its upper left corner that has a line extending to a red circle labeled P to its upper left. Step 3: Cyclin-C D K complex forms, but phosphorylated T y r superscript 15 blocks A T P-binding site; still inactive. An arrow points to a similar molecule with a second wedge labeled T h r in the upper right corner with a line connecting it to a green circle labeled P to the right. Step 4: Phosphorylation of T h r superscript 160 in T loop and dephosphorylation of T y r superscript 15 activates cyclin-C D K manyfold. An arrow points down with an arrow branching off to show the loss of P subscript i. This produces a blue rectangle labeled C D K at the boundary between the upper and lower halves with the left-hand wedge labeled T h r gone, the right-hand wedge labeled T h r attached to a green circle labeled P that is now to its upper right instead of directly to its right, and short lines radiating from its top and sides. A dashed arrow points to the left to an arrow pointing from a green oval labeled phosphatase to a green oval labeled phosphatase with a line extending down to a green circle labeled P at the lower right and with short radiating lines extending from all sides. Step 5: C D K phosphorylates phosphatase, which activates more C D K. A dashed arrow points back to the start of the arrow between C D K with T y r bonded to a red circle labeled P and T h r bonded to a green circle labeled P down, with a loss of P subscript 1, to activated C D K without T y r. Part b begins with two arrows pointing from activated C D K. A dashed horizontal arrow points to the arrow from a purple oval labeled D B R P to a similar purple oval with a line to a green circle labeled P to the lower right and with short radiating lines all around it. Step 6: C D K phosphorylates D B R P, activating it. A dashed arrow points from activated D B R P to the second arrow from activated C D K. This arrow is joined by a line from U, showing its addition, and points to a blue rectangle labeled C D K at the bottom center of the figure that no longer has T h r, still has short radiating lines from its upper half, and has a chain of four U attached to the cyclin bound to its bottom side. Step 7: D B R P triggers addition of ubiquitin molecules to cyclin by ubiquitin ligase. An arrow points to the left and then up to the starting C D K at the boundary between the top and bottom halves. Before it reaches C D K, this arrow has an arrow pointing to the left to a dashed red outline of the shape of cyclin. Step 8: Cyclin is degraded by proteasome, leaving C D K inactive.</p>

Named for the retinal tumor cell line in which it was discovered, pRb functions in most, perhaps all, cell types to regulate cell division in response to a variety of stimuli. Unphosphorylated pRb binds the transcription factor E2F; while bound to pRb, E2F cannot promote transcription of a group of genes necessary for DNA synthesis (the genes for DNA polymerase <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_keFKIJDce6">α</i>, ribonucleotide reductase, and other proteins; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_vyu0ckWLG2" id="dav_9781319322342_FA5MJecVlu">Chapter 25</a>). In this state, the cell cycle cannot proceed from the G1 phase to the S phase, the step that commits a cell to mitosis and cell division. The pRb-E2F blocking mechanism is relieved when pRb is phosphorylated by cyclin E–CDK2, which occurs in response to a signal for cell division to proceed.</p>

The retinoblastoma protein, pRb, can bind E2F (lower left), inactivating it and preventing transcription of these genes. Phosphorylation of pRb by CDK2 prevents it from binding and inactivating E2F, and the genes are transcribed, allowing cell division. Damage to the cell’s DNA (upper left) triggers a series of events that inactivate CDK2, blocking cell division. When the protein MRN detects damage to the DNA, it activates two protein kinases, ATM and ATR, and they phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor p53. Active p53 promotes the synthesis of another protein, p21, an inhibitor of CDK2. Inhibition of CDK2 stops the phosphorylation of pRb, which therefore continues to bind and inhibit E2F. With E2F inactivated, genes essential to cell division are not transcribed and cell division is blocked. When DNA has been repaired, this inhibition is released, and the cell divides.</p>

This protein inhibits the protein kinase activity of cyclin E–CDK2. In the presence of p21, pRb remains unphosphorylated and bound to E2F, blocking the activity of this transcription factor, and the cell cycle is arrested in G1. This gives the cell time to repair its DNA before entering the S phase, thereby avoiding the potentially disastrous transfer of a defective genome to one or both daughter cells. When the damage is too severe to allow effective repair, this same machinery triggers apoptosis (described below), a process that leads to the death of the cell, preventing the possible development of a cancer.</p>

The catalytic subunit of CDKs is inactive unless associated with the regulatory cyclin subunit.</li>

The rise of cyclin concentration by its synthesis ultimately triggers its degradation, yielding oscillations in cyclin level keyed to the cell cycle.</li>

Scores of proteins are known targets of CDKs, many with unknown functions. Among the targets phosphorylated by cyclin-CDKs are proteins of the nuclear envelope and proteins required for cytokinesis and DNA repair.</li>
