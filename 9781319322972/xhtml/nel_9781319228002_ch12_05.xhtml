These pieces expand into rounded ends beneath the membrane. Above the membrane, the light blue pieces join with large light red pieces that run up toward the center and then partially down the other side. The two pieces together form a circular region with an opening and with thicker pieces extending down to the lower left and right to meet the light blue pieces. There are helices and beta strands in the rounded light blue pieces and light red pieces. Part b shows a horizontal piece of plasma membrane with two long light blue vertical pieces that run across the membrane to end in rounded structures. The two strands cross just before they form rounded structures. Each light blue sphere has a rounded rectangular cutout on the upper side facing away from the center. The left-hand light blue circle contains three circles with green borders labeled P. Short lines radiate from all sides of this light blue circle. Above the membrane, the blue pieces widen into light red pieces. The right-hand light red piece curves to the left, then runs up to a rounded piece from which a piece curves to the right and then back behind, where a red sphere labeled insulin is between the front and back pieces. The left-hand light red piece curves to the right, then up, then to the left before curving back across the front. Part c is a close-up of one of the red spheres from part a. It is labeled inactive (unphosphorylated) tyrosine kinase domain. The surface contour of part of a protein is shown. A greenish-blue strand curves from the center top to the left, down the left side, and then up and then down as it runs to the right. Text pointing to this strand reads, activation loop blocks substrate-binding site. Between the top and bottom halves of the greenish-blue strand, there is a stick structure labeled A s p superscript 1132. Extending from below the part of the greenish-blue strand that runs down along the left side, there is a T y r superscript 1158 near the top, then a T y r superscript 1162, then a T y r superscript 1163. Part d shows a close-up from part b. It is similar to the structure in part c except that the greenish-blue strand now runs from the center to curve along the right side and then almost horizontally back across the center, where it ends just before the location of a target protein. A s p superscript 1132 is shown between the top and bottom horizontal pieces of the greenish-blue strand. T y r superscript 1158 is at the point where the strand bends down on the right side, T y r superscript 1162 is at the point where the strand bends left at the lower right, and T y r superscript 1163 is above the strand just to the left of the point where the strand bends left at the lower right. The greenish-blue strand is accompanied by text reading, triply phosphorylated activation loop moves dramatically, making room for the target protein.</p>

Text above a receptor in the membrane reads, insulin receptor binds insulin and undergoes autophosphorylation on its carboxyl-terminal T y r residues. The receptor has two light red strands that run through the plasma membrane and cross beneath it, where each forms a light blue sphere with a rounded rectangular cutout in the part facing outward. There are three green circles labeled P attached to each light blue sphere. Above the membrane, the thin vertical strands widen. The right-hand strand is labeled Greek letter alpha and curves around to the back. The left-hand strand is labeled Greek letter beta and curves around toward the front, with a red sphere labeled insulin between the back and front pieces at the top. Text reads, insulin receptor phosphorylates I R S 1 on its T y r residues. An orange oval labeled I R S 1 has an arrow pointing up to the circles labeled P bound to the blue spheres at the bottom of the receptor and a second arrow points away to a similar orange circle bonded to three green circles labeled P. Text reads, S H 2 domain of G r b 2 binds to P bond T y r of I R S 1. S o s binds to G r b 2, then to R a s, causing G D P release and G T P binding to R a s. The right-hand P bonded to the orange oval labeled I R S 1 fits into the left side of an irregular gray rectangle labeled G r b 2. The right side of G r b 2 fits into the left side of S o s, which resembles a gray rectangle that is wider at its upper and lower left sides and rounded on the right side where it fits against a green circle labeled R a s. Below R a s, there is a light blue structure labeled R a f-1 that resembles an inverted, blunt pyramid that is rounded above to fit against R a s. R a s has a green thread extending into the plasma membrane to its right. G T P has an arrow pointing to R a s, from which an arrow points to G D P. Accompanying text reads, activated R a s binds and activates R a f-1. A diamond-shaped light blue structure labeled M E K has a curved arrow that runs to R a f-1 and then to a similar diamond-shaped light blue structure with two green circles labeled P attached to its right side. Accompanying text reads, R a f-1 phosphorylates M E K on two S e r residues, activating it. M E K phosphorylates E R K on a T h r and a T y r residue, activating it. A light blue oval labeled E R K has an arrow that curves past M E K with two attached Ps to a light blue oval labeled E R K with two green circles labeled P attached to its right side. Accompanying text reads, E R K moves into the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear transcription factors such as E l k 1, activating them. An arrow points from E R K with two P to a similar molecule inside the nucleus. A double stranded piece of D N A is shown below. Two pieces that resemble curved orange rectangles that bend down, then up, then down, are labeled S R F and E l k 1. Double-headed arrows run from each of these past E R K with 2 P to similar structures joined together, with S R F on the left and E l k 1 on the right with its right side bonded to a green circle labeled P, on top of the double helix of D N A. A vertical arrow points down from D N A and then to the right, where a green arrow of m R N A is shown with a curved arrow pointing to protein. A white circle is shown below.

Somewhat less cumbersome are the abbreviations for these three families: MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK. Kinases in the MAPK and MAPKKK families are specific for Ser residues or Thr residues, and MAPKKs (here, MEK) phosphorylate both a Ser residue and a Tyr residue in their substrate, a MAPK (here, ERK).</p>

All these receptors have a Tyr kinase domain (blue) on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The extracellular domain is unique to each type of receptor, reflecting the different growth factor specificities. These extracellular domains are typically combinations of structural motifs such as Cys- or Leu-rich segments and segments containing one of several motifs common to immunoglobulins (Ig). Many other Tyr kinase receptors are encoded in the human genome, each with a different extracellular domain and ligand specificity. All of the receptors except INSR are monomeric and their Tyr kinase activity is silent until ligand binding triggers receptor dimerization and Tyr kinase activation. Only INSR is always dimeric, but its Tyr kinase is active only when insulin is bound.</p>

This system allows one activated receptor to activate several IRS1 molecules, amplifying the insulin signal, and it provides for the integration of signals from different receptors such as EGFR and PDGFR, each of which can phosphorylate IRS1. Furthermore, because IRS1 can activate any of several proteins that contain SH2 domains, a single receptor acting through IRS1 can trigger two or more signaling pathways; insulin affects gene expression through the mitogenic Grb2-Sos-Ras-MAPK pathway and affects glycogen metabolism and glucose transport through the metabolic PI3K-PKB pathway. Finally, there are several closely related IRS proteins (IRS2, IRS3), each with its own characteristic tissue distribution and function, further enriching the signaling possibilities in pathways initiated by RTKs.</p>

Two arrows point from P K B to two red circles labeled P bonded to two S in a horizontal strand extending from the lower left of a Greek letter beta-adrenergic receptor, which is a light blue rectangle that crosses the membrane and contains a thread that loops up and down. The red thread extending from the lower left of the Greek letter beta-adrenergic receptor has two Ss, both bonded to red circles labeled P as previously described, and then two Ys that are each bonded to red circles labeled P. Arrows point from two green circles labeled P bonded to the blue circles at the bottom of the insulin receptor to the two red circles labeled P bonded to Y. To the right of the Greek letter beta-adrenergic receptor, there is a rounded invagination in the membrane containing a similar Greek letter beta-adrenergic receptor. A dashed line points from the first Greek letter beta-adrenergic receptor to the one in the invagination. Text below reads, G P C R internalization, reduced G P C R responsiveness.</p>

Yet another factor that further complicates the signaling picture is that certain metabolic intermediates, such as fatty acids and ceramides, amino acids, and bile acids, can influence insulin signaling. One of the major challenges of systems biology is to sort out the effects of such interactions on the overall metabolic patterns in each tissue — a daunting task.</p>

When insulin binds, the receptor Tyr kinase is activated, and phosphorylates Tyr residues on other proteins, such as IRS. Phosphotyrosine <span aria-label="439" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page439" role="doc-pagebreak"/>residues of IRS1 serve as binding sites for proteins with SH2 domains. These multivalent proteins can serve as adaptors that bring two proteins into proximity. Sos bound to Grb2 activates Ras, which in turn activates a MAPK cascade that ends with the phosphorylation of target proteins in the cytosol and nucleus. The result is specific metabolic changes and altered gene expression.</li>
