Threonine, for instance, is degraded by at least two different pathways (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zrIN7feGaO" id="dav_9781319322342_p21p1Utbu3">Figs 18-19</a>, <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_pfudjO401o" id="dav_9781319322342_bhMML6OJQm">18-27</a>), and the importance of a given pathway can vary with the organism and its metabolic conditions. The glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids are also delineated in the figure, by color shading. Notice that five of the amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic. The amino acids degraded to pyruvate are also potentially ketogenic. Only two amino acids, leucine and lysine, are exclusively ketogenic.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_sLAb7oya2v">Tetrahydrofolate is shown on the left as a six-membered ring with a double bond on its left side between positions 8 a and 4, which are each further bonded to the left. It has N H substituted for C at positions 8 and 5, the top and bottom vertices, respectively. N at position 5 is highlighted in blue. C 7 at the upper right vertex is bonded to 2 H and C 6 at the lower right vertex is bonded to H and to C H 2 further bonded to blue highlighted N numbered 10 that is bonded to H and further bonded to the right. Right- and left-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction to produce italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate. The arrows are labeled serine hydromethyltransferase. The right-pointing arrow is joined by a curved arrow showing the addition of serine and loss of glycine and the point where the arrows meet is labeled P L P. Serine has a central C bonded to C O O minus above, H to the right, red highlighted C H 2 O H below, and N H 3 plus to the left. Glycine is similar except that red highlighted C H 2 O H has been replaced by H. A second arrow branches away to show the loss of H red highlighted O H. This yields italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate in a gray box labeled with the oxidation state of red highlighted further bonded C H 2 O H. Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate is similar to tetrahydrofolate except that blue highlighted N at position 5 is bonded to red highlighted C H 2 below that is bonded to blue highlighted N 10 to its right that is further bonded to C H 2 above further bonded to the lower right vertex of the ring. Arrows point upward and downward from the central gray box containing Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate An arrow labeled italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase points upward accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H accompanied by H plus and the loss of N A D P plus. This yields a molecule in a separate gray box, italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript methyl-tetrahydrofolate, which is similar to the reactant except that blue highlighted N 5 at the bottom vertex of the ring is bonded to red highlighted C H 3 below and blue highlighted N 10 is bonded to H and further bonded. The oxidation state is shown as red highlighted C H 3 that is further bonded and labeled (most reduced). The second arrow from the central gray box containing italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate points down accompanied by an arrow pointing upward, indicating a reversible reaction. It is labeled italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. A curved arrow accompanying the upward arrow shows the addition of an orange oval labeled N A D P H accompanied by H plus and the loss of N A D P plus. This yields italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate in a bottom gray box labeled red highlighted C double bonded to O above, bonded to H to the right, and further bonded accompanied by text reading, (most oxidized). Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate is similar to italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, superscript 10 end superscript methylene-tetrahydrofolate except that blue highlighted N 5 at the bottom vertex of the ring is connected by one solid line and one dashed line to red highlighted C H with a positive sign on C connected by a solid line and a dashed line to blue highlighted N 10. Three reactions can occur. In the right reaction, right- and left-pointing arrows labeled cyclohydrolase lead to a product on the left labeled italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate. The right-pointing arrow indicating the reaction that converts italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate has an arrow branching away to show the loss of H 2 O. Italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is similar to Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate except that blue highlighted N 5 is bonded to H and blue highlighted N 10 is further bonded to the right and bonded below to red highlighted C double bonded to O on the left and bonded to H on the right. An arrow labeled italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate synthetase points from tetrahydrofolate to the left to italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate. The second possible reaction for italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate is shown by upward- and downward-pointing arrows. The downward-pointing arrow is labeled cyclohydrolase (minor); spontaneous. The upward-pointing arrow is labeled italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate synthetase and is accompanied by an arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and the loss of A D P Plus p subscript i. The forward reaction yields italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, which is similar to the reactant except that blue highlighted N 5 is bonded to red highlighted C double bonded to O and bonded to H and blue highlighted N 10 is bonded to H below and further bonded to the right. The third possible reaction for italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript methenyl-tetrahydrofolate is shown by right-and left-pointing arrows labeled cyclodeaminase. The right-pointing arrow is joined by red highlighted N H 4 plus. This yields italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript-formimino-tetrahydrofolate, which is similar to the reactant except that blue highlighted N 5 is bonded to red highlighted C H double bonded to N H below and blue highlighted N 10 is further bonded and bonded to H below. </p>

A T P is added. It has a five-membered ring bonded to a chain of three phosphates to the left and a double-ring structure above to the right. The five-membered ring has C 1 bonded to N in position 9 of a double-ring structure above and to H below, C 2 prime and C 3 prime bonded to H above and O H below, C 4 prime bonded to C 5 prime above and H below, and C 5 prime bonded to 2 H and further bonded to O bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the left further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O to the left further bonded to P double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus below, and bonded to O minus to the left. The double-ring structure has a five-membered ring on the right that shares its left side with a six-membered ring to the right. The five-membered ring has a double bond at its upper right side, between positions 7 and 8, a double bond at the left side that it shares with the six-membered ring between positions 4 and 5, N substituted for C at the upper right vertex at position 7, and N substituted for C at the bottom vertex, at position 9, and further bonded to C 1 prime of the ring below. The six-membered ring has double bonds at the upper left side between positions 1 and 6 and at the lower left side between positions 2 and 3. It has N substituted for C at positions 1 and 3 and a top vertex at position 6 bonded to N H 2. Step 1: An arrow labeled methionine adenosyl transferase points right accompanied by an arrow that branches away to show the loss of P P subscript i plus P subscript i. This yields italicized S-adenosylmethionine. It is similar to A T P except that the phosphates have been lost to allow a bond to form with S plus of methionine. C 5 prime of the five-membered ring is bonded to 2 H and to S plus, which is bonded to unchanged C 1 to C 4 of methionine above and to red highlighted C H 3 below. Step 2: An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of R and loss of R bonded to red highlighted C H 3. Accompanying text at the inflection point reads, a variety of methyl transferases. This yields italicized S end italics-adenosyl-homocysteine, which has a four-carbon vertical chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 bonded to H to the right and N H 3 plus to the left, C 3 bonded to 2 H, and C 4 bonded to 2 H and to S below further bonded to a rectangle labeled adenosine to the right. Step 3: Right- and left-pointing arrows show a reversible reaction that yields homocysteine. The left-pointing arrow, representing the forward reaction, is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of adenosine with hydrolase at the inflection point. Homocysteine is similar to the italicized S end italics-adenosyl-homocysteine except that S is bonded to H instead of adenosine. Step 4: An arrow points left and then up to methionine accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript methyltetrahydrofolate and loss of tetrahydrofolate with the inflection point labeled methionine synthase and coenzyme B subscript 12. Italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript-methyltetrahydrofolate is a six-membered ring with a double bond on its left side between positions 8 a and 4, which are each further bonded to the left. It has N H substituted for C at position 8, the top vertex, and N substituted for C at position 5, the bottom vertex, and further bonded to red highlighted C H 3. C 7 at the upper right vertex is bonded to 2 H and C 6 at the lower right vertex is bonded to H and to C H 2 further bonded to N H that is further bonded to the right. Tetrahydrofolate is similar but N at position 5 is bonded to H instead of C H 3. This reaction yields methionine in the upper left, where A T P can be added to begin the process again.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_PbUmc28Ao2">Part a shows a serine dehydratase reaction. A central C is bonded to H to the right, C O O minus below, N H to the left with a positive charge on N that is double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P, and C H 2 above further bonded to O H. Red arrows point from B with a red pair of electrons and further bound to the right to H bonded to the central C, from the bond between the same H and C to the bond between the same C and C H 2 above, and from the bond between the same C H 2 and O above to H plus to the left. This is labeled covalently bound serine. Step 1: Proton abstraction at a carbon leads to beta elimination of O H. An arrow points down accompanied by a branched arrow showing the loss of H 2 O. This yields a similar molecule in which the central C is no longer bonded to anything on the right and is double bonded to C H 2 above. H B further bonded to the right is also present. Step 2: The link to P L P is reversed. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of a blue oval labeled E n z bonded to L y s and the loss of a blue oval labeled E n z bonded to P L P. This yields a molecule with a central C bonded to C O O minus below, bonded to N H 2 to the left with a red pair of electrons on N, and double bonded to C H 2 above. Red arrows point from the pair of electrons on N to the bond between N and C and from the double bond between C and C H 2 to the same C H 2. Step 3: Rearrangement of the enamine forms an imine. An arrow points down and a curved line shows that H plus is added. This yields a central C bonded to C O O minus below, double bonded to N H 2 plus to the left, and bonded to C H 3 above. Step 4: Hydrolytic deamination yields pyruvate. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of H 2 O and loss of N H 3. This yields pyruvate, which is a central C bonded to C O O minus below, double bonded to O to the left, and bonded to C H 3 above. Part b shows a serine hydroxymethyltransferase. A molecule labeled covalently bound glycine has a central C bonded to H above, H to the right, C O O minus below, and N H plus to the left further double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P. Red arrows point from a red pair of electrons on B to the right that is further bonded to the H bonded above the central C and from the bond between the same H and C to the central C. Step 1: Abstraction of a proton forms a P L P-stabilized carbanion. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows show that a reversible reaction occurs. This yields a P L P-stabilized carbanion, shown as a central C with a red pair of electrons and a negative charge bonded to H to the right, C O O minus below, and N H plus to the left further double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P. H B further bonded to the right is also present. Step 2: The carbanion attacks the methylene of italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-methylene H subscript 4 end subscript folate to yield serine. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows show that a reversible reaction occurs. The downward arrow is accompanied by curved arrows showing the addition of italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end subscript-methylene H subscript 4 end subscript folate and water and loss of H subscript 4 end subscript folate. This yields a similar molecule in which the central C is bonded to C H 2 above further bonded to O H. Step 3: The aldimine link to P L P is reversed, and the product is released. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. The downward arrow is accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of a blue oval labeled E n z bonded to L y s and the loss of a blue oval labeled E n z bonded to P L P. This yields a molecule labeled with the word serine in a rectangle, which has a central C bonded to H to the right, C O O minus below, N H 3 plus to the left, and C H 2 O H above. Part c shows a glycine cleavage enzyme reaction. A molecule labeled covalently bound glycine has a central C bonded to H above, H to the right, C double bonded to O and bonded to O minus below, and N H plus to the left further double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P. Step 1: Decarboxylation of glycine generates a P L P-stabilized carbanion. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. A blue oval labeled E n z P is shown to the left. An arrow branches away from the downward arrow to show the loss of C O 2. This yields a P L P-stabilized anion, which is a similar molecule with a central C with a red pair of electrons and a negative charge that is bonded to H above, H below, and bonded to N H plus to the left further double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P. Below S is connected by a vertical bond to S below and both S atoms are connected to a single bond to a blue oval labeled E n z H to the right. Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on the central C to the top S and from the bond between the two S atoms to H plus below. Step 2: The carbanion attacks the oxidized lipoic acid component of enzyme H. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. This yields a molecule with a central C bonded to H above and below, N H plus to the left further double bonded to C H bonded to a box labeled P L P, and bonded to S to the right with a diagonal bond down to meet a horizontal bond to a blue oval labeled E n z H to the right. At the point where the diagonal bond from S meets the horizontal bond, there is a diagonal bond to H S to the lower left. Step 4: Methylene is transferred to H subscript 4 end subscript folate with elimination of ammonia. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. A blue oval labeled E n z T is shown to the upper left. A curved arrow shows the addition of H subscript 4 end subscript folate and loss of italicized N end italics superscript 5 end superscript, italicized N end italics superscript 10 end superscript-methylene H subscript 4 end subscript folate. A curved arrow branches away to show the loss of N H 3. This yields a blue oval labeled E n z H with a horizontal bond to the left that branches to bond to H S to the upper and lower left. Step 5: Lipoic acid is reoxidized. Upward- and downward-pointing arrows indicate a reversible reaction. A blue oval labeled E n z L is to the left. A curved arrow shows the addition of N A D plus and loss of N A D H. This yields a blue oval labeled E n z H with a horizontal bond to the left that branches to bond to S to the upper and lower left. There is a vertical bond between the S atoms. An arrow points from this product to the same molecule reacting with the P L P-stabilized carbanion above.</p>

Humans with serious defects in glycine cleavage enzyme activity suffer from a condition known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia. The condition is characterized by elevated serum levels of glycine, leading to severe intellectual disability and death in very early childhood.

Phenylalanine and phenylpyruvate accumulate in the blood and tissues and are excreted in the urine — hence the name “phenylketonuria.” Much of the phenylpyruvate, rather than being excreted as such, is either decarboxylated to phenylacetate or reduced to phenyllactate. Phenylacetate imparts a characteristic honeylike odor to the urine, which nurses have traditionally used to detect PKU in infants. The accumulation of phenylalanine or its metabolites in early life impairs normal development of the brain, causing severe intellectual deficits. This may be caused by excess phenylalanine competing with other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier, resulting in a deficit of required metabolites.</p>

When this condition is recognized early in infancy, intellectual disability can be prevented by rigid dietary control. The diet must supply only enough phenylalanine and tyrosine to meet the needs for protein synthesis. Consumption of protein-rich foods must be curtailed. Natural proteins, such as casein of milk, must first be hydrolyzed and much of the phenylalanine removed to provide an appropriate diet, at least through childhood. Because the artificial sweetener aspartame is a dipeptide of aspartate and the methyl ester of phenylalanine (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch01_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_q5fjPIgB70" id="dav_9781319322342_yhDmGidBdM">Fig. 1-23a</a>), foods sweetened with aspartame bear warnings addressed to individuals on phenylalanine-controlled diets.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LyHUXokCnp">The dietary restrictions are difficult to follow perfectly for a lifetime, and thus often do not completely eliminate neurological symptoms. An enzyme substitution treatment has been developed in which the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase is modified with polyethylene glycol (PEGylated) and injected subcutaneously to degrade phenylalanine in proteins ingested as part of a somewhat less restricted diet. Derived from plants, bacteria, and many yeast and fungi, phenylalanine ammonia lyase normally contributes to the biosynthesis of polyphenol compounds such as flavonoids. It degrades phenylalanine to the harmless metabolite <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_4uautD1daT">trans</i>-cinnamic acid and ammonia; the small amounts of ammonia generated are not toxic. The treatment was approved for patients in 2018. The long-term effects of the treatment continue to be studied.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_a23d4qoZi9">Phenylketonuria can also be caused by a defect in the enzyme that catalyzes the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_3Txad1Tb5X" id="dav_9781319322342_VzAfoLbVHv">Fig. 18-24</a>). The treatment in this case is more complex than restricting the intake of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also required for the formation of <span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_MniaODHJsC">l</span>-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (<span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_Rz0Ucj53q6">l</span>-dopa) and 5-hydroxytryptophan — precursors of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin, respectively. In phenylketonuria of this type, these precursors must be supplied in the diet, along with tetrahydrobiopterin.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AVUN35uuGh">Screening newborns for genetic diseases can be highly cost-effective, especially in the case of PKU. The tests (no longer relying on urine odor) are relatively inexpensive, and the detection and early treatment of PKU in infants (eight to ten cases per 100,000 newborns) saves millions of dollars in later health care costs each year. More importantly, the emotional trauma avoided by early detection with these simple tests is inestimable.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_2G5fGmjsY0">Another inheritable disease of phenylalanine catabolism is <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_je6fSW8fDE">alkaptonuria</dfn>, in which the defective enzyme is <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_gI5bur35Hj">homogentisate dioxygenase</dfn> (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_j94Smpl9TP" id="dav_9781319322342_JMCLaK3lNq">Fig. 18-23</a>). Less serious than PKU, this condition produces few ill effects, although large amounts of homogentisate are excreted and its oxidation turns the urine black. Individuals with alkaptonuria are also prone to develop a form of arthritis. Alkaptonuria is of considerable historical interest. Archibald Garrod discovered in the early 1900s that this condition is inherited, and he traced the cause to the absence of a single enzyme. Garrod was the first to make a connection between an inheritable trait and an enzyme — a great advance on the path that ultimately led to our current understanding of genes and the information pathways described in Part III. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_zdF0mWofvG" role="presentation" src="../images/square4.png"/></p>

A rare and recessive genetic disorder, the condition, methylmalonic acidemia or MMA, affects about 1 child in 48,000 (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_EKnbjw3i2O" id="dav_9781319322342_4zmauvdqHw">Fig. 1</a>).

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tOGHv5Ews6">In the summer of 1989, Stallings took her baby son Ryan to the emergency room at the Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital in St. Louis. To the attending physician, a toxicologist, Ryan’s fit of vomiting and labored breathing suggested ingestion of the antifreeze ingredient ethylene glycol. The toxicologist suspected foul play and alerted authorities. Analysis of Ryan’s milk bottles by two laboratories seemed to confirm the physician’s fears. Ryan was placed in foster care as soon as he recovered. Unfortunately for both Ryan and his mother, Ryan subsequently died immediately after a visit from Patricia. Patricia was arrested and charged with murder.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_1C2us6R63N">While awaiting trial, Patricia learned that she was again pregnant. She gave birth to a second son, David, who was placed in foster care. David developed symptoms similar to Ryan’s and was diagnosed with MMA. Although the symptoms of MMA can mimic those observed in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, the revelation did not help Patricia. The information about David’s diagnosis was excluded at her trial for the murder of Ryan. In 1991, Patricia Stallings was sentenced to prison for life.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ieiewqX84g">The situation was ultimately resolved when William Sly, chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at St. Louis University, became interested in the case. Working with metabolic disease experts James Shoemaker and Piero Rinaldo, he had new analyses performed on Ryan’s blood and the original milk bottles. The blood showed high levels of methylmalonic acid and ketones, diagnostic of MMA. Surprisingly, unlike the earlier lab reports, they found no ethylene glycol in any of the samples. Could both a hospital lab and a commercial lab have been mistaken? What the biochemists saw provided the final breakthrough. The biochemists presented all of their materials to the Missouri state prosecutor who had handled the case, George McElroy. Both of the original lab analyses had been so unusually shoddy that they were quickly dismissed. Patricia Stallings was cleared of charges and released on September 20, 1991.</p>

Those portions degraded to acetyl-CoA are completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, with generation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Those portions degraded to other citric acid cycle intermediates can either be oxidized or contribute to gluconeogenesis, depending on the metabolic state.</p>
