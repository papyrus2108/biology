An arrow labeled Greek letter beta oxidation points from fatty acids on the left to acetyl Co A, shown just above an arrow leading into the citric acid cycle and with an arrow pointing upward. The arrow pointing upward from acetyl Co A is labeled ketone body formation and leads to acetoacetate, D-Greek letter beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone. An arrow points from the ketone bodies out of the cell to text reading, acetoacetate and D-Greek letter beta-hydroxybutyrate exported as energy source for heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain. A curved arrow labeled Co A points from the arrow labeled ketone body formation to the arrow labeled Greek letter beta oxidation. There are clockwise arrows forming the citric acid cycle with oxaloacetate shown at about the 11 o’clock position. All data are approximate. An arrow labeled gluconeogenesis points down from oxaloacetate to glucose, from which an arrow points out of the cell to text reading, glucose exported as fuel for brain and other tissues.</p>

Because individuals with untreated diabetes produce large quantities of acetoacetate, their blood contains significant amounts of acetone, which is toxic. Acetone is volatile and imparts a characteristic odor to the breath, which is sometimes useful in diagnosing diabetes. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_OaHXPN7bmq" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_01_pg36.png"/></p>
