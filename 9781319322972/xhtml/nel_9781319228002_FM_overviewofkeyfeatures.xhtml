<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_NQYOBVDGNZ">On the upper left, a screenshot shows information about an activity about enzymes. Text reads, In this chapter, you’ll be learning about how and why enzymes affect biochemical reactions. There are three skills you may have learned in your prerequisite courses that you will need to master this chapter’s content, including: Understanding reaction coordinate diagrams (general chemistry), Understanding and calculating free energy (chemistry, biology, or physics), ad Understanding and applying Bronsted-Lowry acid-base theory (general or organic chemistry). Enzymes are considered to be biological catalysts, and the function of a catalyst is to increase the rate of a reaction without changing the energies of reactants or products. Catalysts do not affect the reaction equilibria. Any chemical reaction can be decried by a bolded reaction coordinate diagram end bold, which is a picture of the energy changes during the reaction. Reaction coordinate diagrams also provide insight in establishing a bolded reaction’s mechanism end bold. Below, a graph plots energy on the vertical axis against increasing progress of the reaction on the horizontal axis with a red line that begins at the middle of the vertical axis, rises to a peak at one-third of the length of the horizontal axis and just over half the height of the vertical axis, dips slightly, rises to a peak halfway across the horizontal axis at three-quarters of the height of the vertical axis, and drops to a minimum at three-quarters of the length of the horizontal axis and one-eighth the height of the vertical axis before curving up slightly. To the upper right, text reads, bolded Skills You need end bold chapter-level activities provide a just-in-time refresher of chemistry, biology, and math concepts and skills that students should know for each chapter of italicized Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry end italics. Designed to be completed in 30 minutes or less, each activity explains how skills and concepts from prerequisite or other courses will be relevant to the chapter, revisits the information, and gives students a chance to evaluate their mastery. In addition, the activities provide short tutorials and identify vocabulary, skills, and concept requiring more practice. In the center of the screen, a graph plots energy on the vertical axis against increasing reaction progress on the horizontal axis. Two curves are shown on the graph that both begin near the center of the vertical axis along a dashed horizontal line and both end near the right end of the horizontal axis at one-third the height of the vertical axis along lower dashed horizontal line. The first curve peaks at a dashed horizontal line at almost halfway across the horizontal axis near the top of the vertical axis. The second curve follows a similar pattern but peaks at one-quarter of the height of the vertical axis. Boxes are provided to label the reactants, delta G degree symbol, products, uncatalyzed reaction, catalyzed reaction, and standard free E of activation. An answer bank to the right provides six options for answers. To the lower left, a screen shot labeled metabolic map shows multiple options for viewing metabolic reactions under different conditions (such as different physiological states) and with varying broken enzymes. Extending to the right and below from beneath the metabolic math, a figure shows the citric acid cycle accompanied by text titled Citric Acid Cycle Overview. A green box below reads, bolded Interactive Metabolic Map end bold allows students to navigate and zoom between overviews and detailed views of the most commonly taught metabolic pathways. Embedded Tours take students through the pathways step by step, helping them both to visualize concepts in isolation and understand how concepts are connected. By examining the pathways in this way, students are better equipped to understand the meaning of those connections. Assessment questions help students solidify their understanding and provide more structure to their learning. *Metabolic Pathways include: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, the urea cycle, and beta oxidation.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ov8kNlepTf">A question at the top of the figure reads, Modify the molecules to show the oligopeptide A l a – A l a – A l a. You can modify the molecules by moving, adding, or changing atoms, bonds, or charges. A row below provides options labeled select, draw, rings, more, and erase. Beneath this, a row of five boxes show options for single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds, solid wedge bonds, and hashed wedge bonds. To the right, a row of six boxes are labeled H, C, N, O, S, and C l. Three molecules are aligned horizontally in the space below. Each molecule has N on the left with a green circle labeled with a positive charge bonded to H above, to the left, and below ad bonded to C to the right bonded to H above, C H 3 below, and C to the right double bonded to O above and bonded to O to the right with a light red circle labeled with a negative symbol. At the lower left, a left-hand box shows an undo arrow and a right-hand box shows a red arrow. At the lower right, three boxes show options to change the size of the image.</p>
