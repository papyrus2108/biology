<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_kmBiBXIRvn">Transcription is mediated and regulated by protein-DNA interactions, especially those involving the protein components of RNA polymerase (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6G7PupxZoI" id="dav_9781319322342_SemqTOTgOd">Chapter 26</a>). We first consider how the activity of RNA polymerase is regulated. Next, we proceed to a general description of the proteins participating in this regulation. We then examine the molecular basis for the recognition of specific DNA sequences by DNA-binding proteins. Regulatory RNAs are encountered most often in the regulation of mRNA translation in eukaryotes, but also play a role in the life of some bacterial mRNAs. We consider them briefly in this section, and in more detail in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_7klTK8B6BU" id="dav_9781319322342_GmTe142cDj">Section 28.3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_1ODYgXrh1V">Genes for products that are required at all times, such as those for the enzymes of central metabolic pathways, are expressed continuously, with little variation in virtually every cell of a species or organism. Such genes are often referred to as <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_58NJHcXCfP">housekeeping genes</dfn>. Expression of a gene at approximately constant levels is called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_iAxPV4zCeg">constitutive gene expression</strong>. Although housekeeping genes are expressed constitutively, the cellular concentrations of the proteins they encode vary widely. For these genes, the RNA polymerase–promoter interaction strongly influences the rate of transcription initiation. Differences in promoter sequence may be the only level of regulation for a housekeeping gene, allowing the cell to synthesize the appropriate level of each housekeeping gene product.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Lj1JuexWN2">The basal rate of transcription initiation at the promoters of nonhousekeeping genes is also determined by the promoter sequence, but expression of these genes is further modulated by regulatory proteins. Many of these proteins work by enhancing or interfering with the interaction between RNA polymerase and the promoter.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_1zhPPlvOEy">The sequences of eukaryotic promoters are much more variable than their bacterial counterparts. The three eukaryotic RNA polymerases usually require an array of general transcription factors in order to bind to a promoter, and these can heavily influence basal transcription rates. Yet, as with bacterial gene expression, the basal level of transcription is determined in part by the effect of promoter sequences on the function of RNA polymerase and its associated transcription factors.</p>

Where it does occur (more often in lower eukaryotes such as yeast), the binding site for a repressor may be some distance from the promoter. Binding of these repressors to their binding sites has the same effect as in bacterial cells: inhibiting the assembly or activity of a transcription complex at the promoter.</p>

(b) Repressor binds in the presence of the signal; the repressor dissociates, and transcription ensues when the signal is removed. Positive regulation is mediated by gene activators. Again, two types are shown. (c) Activator binds in the absence of the molecular signal and transcription proceeds; when the signal is added, the activator dissociates and transcription is inhibited.

Many bacterial mRNAs are polycistronic — multiple genes on a single transcript — and the single promoter that initiates transcription of the cluster is the site of regulation for expression of all the genes in the cluster.

Operons that include two to six genes transcribed as a unit are common; some operons contain 20 or more genes. The identity and order of the genes in an operon are not random. In many cases, genes in the same operon encode subunits of a larger protein complex, and cotranslation directly enables assembly of the complex. Some operons organize genes involved in related processes that require coordinated regulation. In other cases, the genes may seem to be unrelated, but they encode products required by the cell under similar conditions.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_9U7nkxnObL">Part a shows a horizontal strand that runs from its 5 prime end on the left to its 3 prime end on the right. From left to right, it has a short blue piece, a purple piece labeled P subscript I end subscript, a light red piece labeled italicized lac end italics I, an orange piece labeled O subscript 3 end subscript, a short blue piece, a purple piece labeled P, an orange piece labeled O subscript 1 end subscript, a long tan piece labeled italicized lac Z end italics, an orange piece labeled O subscript 2 end subscript, a tan piece, a tan piece labeled italicized lac Y end italics, a yellow piece labeled lac A end italics, and a short blue piece. At the boundary between purple P subscript I end subscript and light red italicized lac I end italics and at the boundary between orange O 1 and tan italicized lac Z end italics, there are short vertical lines that meet horizontal arrows pointing to the right. A close-up of the orange region labeled O subscript 1 end subscript shows the base pairs of this double-stranded piece of D N A. The top strand begins at the 5 prime end, then has a light orange region containing A A T T G T, then has an unshaded region containing G A G C G G A T A, then has a dark orange region containing A C A A T T before ending at the 3 prime end. The bottom strand begins at the 3 prime end, then has a dark orange region containing T T A A C A, then has an unshaded region containing C T C G C C T A T before a light orange region containing T G T T A A before ending at the 5 prime end. Part b shows a similar structure except that the orange region labeled O subscript 3 end subscript curves upward, the blue region to its right curves further to the right, and the purple region labeled P forms a loop above before meeting the left side of the orange region labeled O subscript 1 end subscript, which curves back down to horizontal. A red repressor below binds to O subscript 3 end subscript and O subscript 1 end subscript. The left front of the repressor is a light red oval that angles slightly toward the upper left to meet a smaller, almost horizontal oval that runs against the lower right of O subscript 3 end subscript. Behind it, a more vertical oval has a smaller oval that extends to the upper right to bind to the other side of O subscript 3 end subscript and the lower left of the blue region. In the right front, an almost vertical oval joins to the left-hand front oval and extends up until the small oval at its top angles up to the left along the lower left of O subscript 1 end subscript. Behind it, another oval extends slightly to its right and has a smaller oval that runs horizontally to meet the lower right of O subscript 1 end subscript. Beneath, the horizontal strand is shown again but the repressor is now beneath O subscript 1 end subscript and O subscript 2 end subscript with italicized lac Z end italics forming the loop above. The shape of the repressor is the same. Part c shows a close-up of the structure of the repressor. It has four subunits. Each bottom subunit is roughly oval and joins to a smaller, roughly oval part above. The left front piece is pink, the left rear piece is dark red, the right rear piece is bright red, and the right front piece is purplish red. The small ovals at the top of the left two halves bind to the bottom of one short horizontal piece of D N A and the two small ovals at the top of the right two halves bind to the bottom of a second short horizontal piece of D N A.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_5OLPC9YyJf">To interact with bases in the major groove of DNA, a protein requires a relatively small substructure that can stably protrude from the protein surface. The DNA-binding domains of regulatory proteins tend to be small (60 to 90 amino acid residues), and the structural motifs within these domains that are actually in contact with the DNA are smaller still. Many small proteins are unstable because of their limited capacity to form layers of structure to bury hydrophobic groups. The DNA-binding motifs provide either a very compact stable structure or a way of allowing a segment of protein to protrude from the protein surface.</p>

We also consider two other types of such motifs: the homeodomain and the RNA recognition motif, which, as its name implies, also binds RNA; both motifs play prominent roles in some eukaryotic regulatory proteins.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_oK76aU6exT">Regulatory proteins contain domains not only for DNA binding but also for protein-protein interactions — with RNA polymerase, other regulatory proteins, or other subunits of the same regulatory protein. Examples include many eukaryotic transcription factors that function as gene activators, which often bind as dimers to the DNA through DNA-binding domains that contain zinc fingers. Some structural domains are devoted to the interactions required for dimer formation, which is generally a prerequisite for DNA binding. Like DNA-binding motifs, the structural motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions tend to fall within one of a few common categories. Two important examples are the leucine zipper and the basic helix-loop-helix. Structural motifs such as these are the basis for classifying some regulatory proteins into structural families.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_zEnVctDB4t">Combinatorial control is accomplished in part by mixing and matching the variants within a regulatory protein family to form a series of different active protein dimers. Several families of eukaryotic transcription factors have been defined on the basis of close structural similarities. Within each family, dimers can sometimes form between two identical proteins (a homodimer) or between two different members of the family (a heterodimer). A hypothetical family of four different leucine-zipper proteins could thus form up to 10 different dimeric species. In many cases, the different combinations have distinct regulatory and functional properties and regulate different genes. As we shall see, multiple regulatory proteins of this kind function in the regulation of most eukaryotic genes, further contributing to combinatorial control.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pVVFfrDFaw">In addition to having structural domains devoted to DNA binding and protein dimerization, which direct a particular protein dimer to a particular gene, many regulatory proteins have domains that interact with RNA polymerase, with regulatory RNAs, with unrelated regulatory proteins, or with some combination of the three. At least three types of additional domains for protein-protein interaction have been characterized (primarily in eukaryotes): glutamine-rich, proline-rich, and acidic domains, the names reflecting the amino acid residues that are especially abundant.</p>

The Lac repressor dissociates from the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_0w5c3PHoiW">lac</i> operator when the repressor binds to its inducer, allolactose.</li>

Within these domains, common structural motifs that bind DNA (and/or RNA) are the helix-turn-helix, zinc finger, homeodomain, and RNA recognition motif.</li>

Mixing and matching of protein family variants in dimeric transcription factors provides for more efficient and responsive regulation through combinatorial control.</li>
