Cellular proteostasis requires the coordinated function of pathways for protein synthesis and folding, the refolding of proteins that are partially unfolded, and the sequestration and degradation of proteins that have been irreversibly unfolded or are no longer needed. In all cells, these networks involve hundreds of enzymes and specialized proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6MwZ6T2XwJ">As seen in <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_WbbwVEO6II"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_nZoqGnKjKq" id="dav_9781319322342_jhkL5iRwzO">Figure 4-23</a></strong>, the life of a protein encompasses much more than its synthesis and later degradation. The marginal stability of most proteins can produce a tenuous balance between folded and unfolded states. As proteins are synthesized on ribosomes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_P6sv7MfqNo">Chapter 27</a>), they must fold into their native conformations. Sometimes this occurs spontaneously, but often it requires the assistance of specialized enzymes and complexes called chaperones, which we discuss later in the chapter. Many of these same folding helpers function to refold proteins that become transiently unfolded. Proteins that are not properly folded often have exposed hydrophobic surfaces that render them “sticky,” leading to the formation of inactive aggregates. These aggregates may lack their normal function but are not inert; their accumulation in cells lies at the heart of diseases ranging from diabetes to Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Not surprisingly, all cells have elaborate pathways for recycling and/or degrading proteins that are irreversibly misfolded.</p>

Three kinds of processes contribute to proteostasis, in some cases with multiple contributing pathways. First, proteins are synthesized on a ribosome. Second, various pathways contribute to protein folding, many of which involve the activity of complexes called chaperones. Chaperones (including chaperonins) also contribute to the refolding of proteins that are partially and transiently unfolded. Finally, proteins that are irreversibly unfolded are subject to sequestration and degradation by several additional pathways. Partially unfolded proteins and protein-folding intermediates that escape the quality-control activities of the chaperones and degradative pathways may aggregate, forming both disordered aggregates and ordered amyloidlike aggregates that contribute to disease and aging processes. <span class="attribution" id="dav_9781319322342_v8fMP3kNy7">[Information from F.

The misfolded protein can also undergo aggregation, shown with an arrow pointing down to a row of amorphous aggregates, oligomers, or amyloid fibrils, or can undergo remodeling, shown above a box labeled chaperones, to return to a folding intermediate. From the original folding intermediate, this is the pathway shown diagonally to the right. The folding intermediate can also undergo disaggregation, shown with a box labeled chaperones, to form amorphous aggregates, oligomers, or amyloid fibrils. The reverse of this process is aggregation. Aggregation and disaggregation are the pathway shown below the folding intermediate. Amorphous aggregates are shown as a ball of strands. Oligomers are shown as eight horizontal arrows pointing left or right and connected by strands. Amyloid fibrils are shown as seven horizontal arrows lined up vertically and alternating pointing to the right or the left from top to bottom.

They often feature high densities of charged residues on their surfaces, even tighter hydrophobic packing in their interiors, and folds rendered less flexible by networks of ion pairs.

Each of these denaturing agents represents a relatively mild treatment in the sense that no covalent bonds in the polypeptide chain are broken. Organic solvents, urea, and detergents act primarily by disrupting the hydrophobic aggregation of nonpolar amino acid side chains that produces the stable core of globular proteins; urea also disrupts hydrogen bonds; and extremes of pH alter the net charge on a protein, causing electrostatic repulsion and the disruption of some hydrogen bonding. The denatured structures <span aria-label="130" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page130" role="doc-pagebreak"/>resulting from these various treatments are not necessarily the same.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qsn9RPxByy">Denaturation often leads to protein precipitation, a consequence of protein aggregate formation as exposed hydrophobic surfaces associate. The aggregates are often highly disordered. One example is the protein precipitate that can be seen after an egg white is boiled.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_R18z1TJjL1">A classic example is the denaturation and renaturation of ribonuclease A, demonstrated by Christian Anfinsen in the 1950s. Purified ribonuclease A denatures completely in a concentrated urea solution in the presence of a reducing agent. The reducing agent cleaves the four disulfide bonds to yield eight Cys residues, and the urea disrupts the stabilizing hydrophobic effect, thus freeing the entire polypeptide from its folded conformation. Denaturation of ribonuclease is accompanied by a complete loss of catalytic activity. When the urea and the reducing agent are removed, the denatured ribonuclease spontaneously refolds into its correct tertiary structure, with full restoration of its catalytic activity <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_VYDeEInEFG">(<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_wv4TD9lYZB" id="dav_9781319322342_gqrd0Cwhix">Fig. 4-25</a>)</strong>. The refolding of ribonuclease is so accurate that the four <span aria-label="131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" role="doc-pagebreak"/>intrachain disulfide bonds are re-formed in the same positions in the renatured molecule as in the native ribonuclease. Later, similar results were obtained using chemically synthesized, catalytically active ribonuclease A. This eliminated the possibility that some minor contaminant in Anfinsen’s purified ribonuclease preparation might have contributed to renaturation of the enzyme, and thus it dispelled any remaining doubt that this enzyme folds spontaneously.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8C3wHEVeKW">The folding pathway of a large polypeptide chain is unquestionably complicated. However, robust algorithms can often predict the structure of smaller proteins on the basis of their amino acid sequences. The major folding pathways are hierarchical. Local secondary structures form first. Certain amino acid sequences fold readily into <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_LEaeTUSILV">α</i> helices or <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_iK6WmLBG0Q">β</i> sheets, guided by constraints such as those reviewed in our discussion of secondary structure. Ionic interactions, involving charged groups that are often near one another in the linear sequence of the polypeptide chain, can play an important role in guiding these early folding steps. Assembly of local structures is followed by longer-range interactions between, say, two elements of secondary structure that come together to form stable folded structures. The hydrophobic effect plays a significant role throughout the process, as the aggregation of nonpolar amino acid side chains provides an entropic stabilization to intermediates and, eventually, to the final folded structure. The process continues until complete domains form and the entire polypeptide is folded <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_HgZx6iEgV5">(<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_sxcE5X6HKw" id="dav_9781319322342_kMpgTFswL7">Fig. 4-26</a>)</strong>. Notably, proteins dominated by close-range interactions (between pairs of residues generally located near each other in the polypeptide sequence) tend to fold faster than proteins with more complex folding patterns and with many long-range interactions between different segments. As larger proteins with multiple domains are synthesized, domains near the amino terminus (which are synthesized first) may fold before the entire polypeptide has been assembled.</p>

Small depressions along the sides of the free-energy funnel represent semistable intermediates that can briefly slow the folding process. At the bottom of the funnel, an ensemble of folding intermediates has been reduced to a single native conformation (or one of a small set of native conformations). The funnels can have a variety of shapes, depending on the complexity of the folding pathway, the existence of semistable intermediates, and the potential for particular intermediates to assemble into aggregates of misfolded proteins.</p>

For example, a protein may have two stable domains joined by a segment that is entirely disordered. Regions of low stability may allow a protein to alter its conformation between two or more states. As we shall see in the next two chapters, variations in the stability of regions within a protein are often essential to protein function.

Hsp70 proteins bind to regions of unfolded polypeptides that are rich in hydrophobic residues. These chaperones thus “protect” both proteins subject to denaturation by heat and new peptide molecules being synthesized (and not yet folded). Hsp70 proteins also block the folding of certain proteins that must remain unfolded until they have been translocated across a membrane (as described in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch27_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YpAiA5I1wG" id="dav_9781319322342_BNTHZxa0SH">Chapter 27</a>).

The pathway by which chaperones of the Hsp70 class bind and release polypeptides is illustrated for the eukaryotic chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40. The chaperones do not actively promote the folding of the substrate protein, but instead prevent aggregation of unfolded peptides. The unfolded or partly folded proteins bind first to the open, ATP-bound form of Hsp70. Hsp40 then interacts with this complex and triggers ATP hydrolysis that produces the closed form of the complex, in which the domains colored orange and yellow come together like the two parts of a jaw, trapping parts of the unfolded protein inside. Dissociation of ADP and recycling of the Hsp70 requires interaction with another type of protein called a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF). For a population of polypeptide molecules, some fraction of the molecules released after the transient binding of partially folded proteins by Hsp70 will take up the native conformation. The remainder are quickly rebound by Hsp70 or diverted to the chaperonin system. [Information from F. U.

The proteins are secreted in an incompletely folded conformation. The core (or some part of it) folds into a <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_7O8Qibxfez">β</i> sheet before the rest of the protein folds correctly, and the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_9DgWLDfwfc">β</i> sheets of two or more incompletely folded protein molecules associate to begin forming an amyloid fibril.

Other parts of the protein then fold differently, remaining on the outside of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_2IyF3nJ1HC">β</i>-sheet core in the growing fibril. The effect of aromatic residues in stabilizing the structure is shown in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_T4ZvFExuqU" id="dav_9781319322342_57g6XFN6jS">Figure 4-29c</a>. Because most of the protein molecules fold normally, the onset of symptoms in the amyloidoses is often very slow. If a person inherits a mutation such as substitution with an aromatic residue at a position that favors formation of amyloid fibrils, disease symptoms may begin at an earlier age.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_3eRgqih3Fm">The amyloid deposition diseases that trigger neurodegeneration, particularly in older adults, are a special class of localized amyloidoses.

Deposits of these amyloid fibers seem to be the primary cause of Alzheimer disease, but a second type of amyloidlike aggregation, involving a protein called tau, also occurs intracellularly (in neurons) in people with <span aria-label="135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Alzheimer disease. Inherited mutations in the tau protein do not result in Alzheimer disease, but they cause a frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (a condition with symptoms resembling Parkinson disease) that can be equally devastating.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_gLE0Y9MWZL">Several other neurodegenerative conditions involve intracellular aggregation of misfolded proteins. In Parkinson disease, the misfolded form of the protein <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_cDQq0s6fAF">α</i>-synuclein aggregates into spherical filamentous masses called Lewy bodies. Huntington disease involves the protein huntingtin, which has a long polyglutamine repeat. In some individuals, the polyglutamine repeat is longer than normal, and a more subtle type of intracellular aggregation occurs. Notably, when the mutant human proteins involved in Parkinson disease and Huntington disease are expressed in <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_nuGMYse2jq">Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the flies display neurodegeneration expressed as eye deterioration, tremors, and early death.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_g8SmOfhyor">A misfolded brain protein seems to be the causative agent of several rare degenerative brain diseases in mammals. Perhaps the best known of these is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; also known as mad cow disease). Related diseases include kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. These diseases are also referred to as spongiform encephalopathies, because the diseased brain frequently becomes riddled with holes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_aobcdCS8O5" id="dav_9781319322342_FN94pzth3j">Fig. 1</a>). Progressive deterioration of the brain leads to a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including weight loss; erratic behavior; problems with posture, balance, and coordination; and loss of cognitive function. The diseases are fatal.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZsDCEFyile">In the 1960s, investigators found that preparations of the disease-causing agents seemed to lack nucleic acids. At this time, Tikvah Alper suggested that the agent was a protein. Initially, the idea seemed heretical. All disease-causing agents known up to that time—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and so on—contained nucleic acids, and their virulence was related to genetic reproduction and propagation. However, four decades of investigations, pursued most notably by Stanley Prusiner, have provided evidence that spongiform encephalopathies are different.</p>

The first protein is labeled, uppercase P lowercase R uppercase P superscript uppercase C. The protein has an almost vertical helix labeled, helix C, helix A at the top right that orients horizontally and slightly toward the observer, helix B that runs diagonally from the upper left to intercept the middle of helix C, and two short ribbon arrows near the bottom of helix B, one pointing to the right and one pointing to the lower left. An arrow points to the uppercase P lowercase R uppercase P italicized uppercase S lowercase C model on the right. This has helix B and helix C close to their original positions, but no helix A. Near the bottom of helix B, three ribbon arrows point slightly upward to the left. At their tips, three arrows point down and to the right. Just to the right of these three arrow point up toward helix B. An arrow points down to the aggregate of uppercase P lowercase R uppercase P superscript uppercase S lowercase C. This has three copies of the structure from the previous step, each with the arrows toward the center and the helices toward the outside.</p>

A complete understanding of prion diseases awaits new information on how prion protein affects brain function. Structural information about PrP is beginning to provide insights into the molecular process that allows the prion proteins to interact so as to alter their conformation (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_05.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_FWesnj6AZZ" id="dav_9781319322342_fozoCDDkAd">Fig. 2</a>). The significance of prions may extend well beyond spongiform encephalopathies. Evidence is building that prionlike proteins may be responsible for additional neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), a disease that resembles Parkinson disease.</p>
