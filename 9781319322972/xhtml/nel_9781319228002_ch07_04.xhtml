<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_qGuLy6GsrP">In addition to their important roles as fuel stores (starch, glycogen, dextran) and as structural materials (cellulose, chitin, peptidoglycans), polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are information carriers. Some provide communication between cells and their extracellular surroundings; others label proteins for transport to and localization in specific organelles, or for destruction when the protein is malformed or superfluous; and others serve as recognition sites for extracellular signal molecules (growth factors, for example) or extracellular parasites (bacteria or viruses). On almost every eukaryotic cell, specific oligosaccharide chains attached to components of the plasma membrane form a carbohydrate layer (the glycocalyx), several nanometers thick, that serves as an information-rich surface that the cell shows to its surroundings. These oligosaccharides are central players in cell-cell recognition and adhesion, cell migration during development, blood clotting, the immune response, wound healing, and other cellular processes. In most of these cases, the informational carbohydrate is covalently joined to a protein or a lipid to form a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_8kBNReFse2"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_P6gfZGhfOn" id="dav_9781319322342_i2NCIhsbLw" role="doc-glossref">glycoconjugate</a></dfn>, which is the biologically active molecule (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_ttRuSrGNnn"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_kTemJXssDQ" id="dav_9781319322342_pKlvdqX6WW">Fig. 7-20</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_8ozFgNrQ2R">The glycosaminoglycan chains in proteoglycans can bind to a variety of extracellular ligands and thereby modulate the ligands’ interaction with specific receptors of the cell surface. Detailed studies of heparan sulfate demonstrate a domain structure that is not random; some domains (typically three to eight disaccharide units long) differ from neighboring domains in sequence and in ability to bind to specific proteins. Highly sulfated domains (called NS domains) alternate with domains having unmodified GlcNAc and GlcA residues (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_uUAlfC6CSk">N</i>-acetylated, or NA, domains) (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_wETlpXeOkR" id="dav_9781319322342_wamDVD78AA">Fig. 7-22b</a>). The exact pattern of sulfation in the NS domain depends on the particular proteoglycan; given the number of possible modifications of the GlcNAc–IdoA (iduronic acid) dimer, at least 32 different disaccharide units are possible. Furthermore, the same core protein can display different heparan sulfate structures when synthesized in different cell types.</p>

A third general mechanism of action is the binding of extracellular signal molecules (growth factors, for example) to heparan sulfate, which increases their local concentrations and enhances their interaction with growth factor receptors on the cell surface; in this case, the heparan sulfate acts as a coreceptor (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_MTgiW2UO63" id="dav_9781319322342_nGhQzXtYw4">Fig. 7-23c</a>). For example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), an extracellular protein signal that stimulates cell division, first binds to heparan sulfate moieties of syndecan molecules in the target cell’s plasma membrane. Syndecan presents FGF to the FGF plasma membrane receptor, and only then can FGF interact productively with its receptor to trigger cell division. Finally, in another type of mechanism, the NS domains interact — electrostatically and otherwise — with a variety of soluble molecules outside the cell, maintaining high local concentrations at the cell surface (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_MTgiW2UO63" id="dav_9781319322342_FPODWg6JRw">Fig. 7-23d</a>).</p>

These two horizontal oval structures each has a thin vertical piece that runs down through the membrane to rounded bases beneath the membrane. Text reads, N S domains interact with both the fibroblast growth factor (F G F) and its receptor, bringing the oligomeric complex together and increasing the effectiveness of a low concentration of F G F. Part d: Cell surface localization/concentration. A horizontal piece of membrane is shown with a long vertical core protein running through it. The core protein is attached to two bars of heparan sulfate, one extending to the left and one extending to the right.

Two are above the green segment of the left-hand bar of heparan sulfate, and two are attached to the green segment on the right bar of heparan sulfate. Text reads, The high density of negative charges in heparan sulfate attracts positively charged lipoprotein lipase molecules and holds them by electrostatic and sequence-specific interactions with N S domains.</p>

C 2 is bonded to N H below the ring that is further bonded to C that is double bonded to O and further bonded to C that is bonded to an 11-carbon chain below and hashed wedge bonded to O that is further bonded to C double bonded to O and to an 11-carbon chain below; C 3 is bonded to O above the ring that has a bond downward to C that is double bonded to O and further bonded to C that is bonded to an 11-carbon chain below and hashed wedge bonded to O that is further bonded to C that is double bonded to O and further bonded to an 11-carbon chain extending downward; C 4 is bonded to O below the ring that is further bonded to P that is double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus on the left, and bonded to O H below; C 5 is bonded to C 6 above the ring that is further bonded to O that is bonded to a hexagon labeled K in the core. The second sugar ring has O at the top right vertex between C 5 and C 1. C 1 is bonded to O below the ring that is further bonded to P that is double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus to the back right, and bonded to O H to the front right; C 2 is bonded to N H below the ring that is further bonded to C that is double bonded to O and single bonded to C that is hashed wedge bonded to O H and further bonded to an 11-carbon chain; C 3 is bonded to O above the ring that has a bond extending down to C that is double bonded to O and further bonded to C that is hashed wedge bonded to O H and further bonded to an 11-carbon chain. All of the 11-carbon chains in lipid A extend vertically downward. A bond between a hexagon labeled K in the core to O of the left-hand sugar ring connects the core with lipid A. The hexagon labeled K is connected on the right to a chain of two hexagons labeled K and is connected above to a hexagon labeled H that is connected above to a hexagon labeled H that is connected to a hexagon labeled H on the right and to a blue circle above. The blue circle is connected to a yellow circle on the right and to a yellow circle above that is connected to a blue circle above that is connected to a blue square on its right and a yellow circle above where the O-specific chain starts that is further connected to a hexagon labeled R that is bonded to a green circle above that is further bonded on the right and bonded to a yellow circle above that is connected to a green circle on the right and to a hexagon labeled R above. The hexagon labeled R is connected to a green circle above that is connected to a hexagon labeled A on the right and to a yellow circle of a repeating subunit above. The repeating subunit has the yellow circle at the bottom, which is bonded to a blue circle on its right and a hexagon labeled R above that is further bonded to a green circle above that is bonded to a hexagon labeled A on tis right. Text next to the subunit reads n greater than or equal to 10.</p>

Bound to the outside of the plasma membrane through a peptide or lipid, proteoglycans provide points of adhesion, recognition, and information transfer between cells, or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. In the extracellular matrix, enormous proteoglycan aggregates form, bound to a long hyaluronan molecule.</li>

The oligosaccharides are typically branched and smaller than glycosaminoglycans. Many cell surface or extracellular proteins are glycoproteins, as are most secreted proteins. The covalently attached oligosaccharides influence the folding and stability of the proteins, provide critical information about the targeting of newly synthesized proteins, and allow specific recognition by other proteins.</li>
