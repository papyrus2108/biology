<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_KFX3gY8l1h">During active photosynthesis in bright light, a plant leaf produces more carbohydrate (as triose phosphates) than it needs for generating energy or synthesizing precursors. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_I75jpXW583" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG02.png"/> The excess is converted to sucrose and transported to other parts of the plant, to be used as fuel or stored. In most plants, starch is the main storage form of carbohydrate, but in a few plants, such as sugar beet and sugarcane, sucrose is the primary storage form. The synthesis of sucrose and starch occurs in different cellular compartments (cytosol and plastids, respectively), and these processes are coordinated by a variety of regulatory mechanisms that respond to changes in light level and photosynthetic rate. The synthesis of sucrose and starch is important to the plant but also to humans: starch provides more than 80% of human dietary calories worldwide.</p>

The citrate synthase, aconitase, and malate dehydrogenase of the glyoxylate cycle are isozymes of the citric acid cycle enzymes; isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are unique to the glyoxylate cycle. Notice that two acetyl groups enter the cycle and four carbons leave as succinate. Succinate is exported to mitochondria, where it is converted to oxaloacetate by enzymes of the citric acid cycle. Oxaloacetate enters the cytosol and serves as the starting material for gluconeogenesis and for synthesis of sucrose, the transport form of carbon in plants.</p>

At the top of the glyoxysome, three arrows labeled b oxidation point down from fatty acid to acetyl Co A, shown as C H 3 bonded to C double bonded to O above and bonded to S to the right further bonded to Co A. Except for S bonded to Co A, acetyl Co A is enclosed in a light red box. Acetyl Co A is added to the glyoxylate cycle at the twelve o’clock position, where it joins an arrow labeled citrate synthase that extends from oxaloacetate at the eleven o’clock position to aconitase at the two o’clock position. Oxaloacetate is shown as C double bonded to O to the left, bonded to C O O minus to the right, and bonded to C H 2 below further bonded to C O O minus. Citrate is a vertical three-carbon vertical chain with C 1 bonded to 2 H and C O O minus, C 2 bonded to O H on the left and to C O O minus on the right, and C 3 bonded to 2 H and to C O O minus on the right. An arrow labeled aconitase points down to isocitrate at the four o’clock position. Isocitrate is a vertical three-carbon chain with C 1 bonded to 2 H and C O O minus on the right, C 2 bonded to H and to C O O minus on the right, and C 3 bonded to H, to O H on the left, and to C O O minus on the right.

Malate is a vertical four-carbon chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 bonded to O H to the left and H to the right, C 3 bonded to 2 H, and C 4 forming C O O minus. An arrow labeled malate dehydrogenase points from malate to oxaloacetate accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of N A D plus and loss of an orange oval labeled N A D H. An arrow points from succinate at the lower right to succinate at the two o’clock position of the citric acid cycle in the mitochondrion. Arrows point from succinate to fumarate, from fumarate to malate, and from malate to oxaloacetate. Two arrows point from oxaloacetate. A blue arrow continues the left side of the citric acid cycle by pointing to citrate, from which a blue arrow points to isocitrate, then a blue arrow points to alpha-ketoglutarate, then a blue arrow points to succinyl Co A, then a blue arrow points back to succinate. The other arrow points from oxaloacetate in the mitochondrion to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is shown as a four-carbon horizontal chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 double bonded to O above, C 3 bonded to 2 H, and C 4 forming C O O minus. An arrow points down to phosphoenolpyruvate with an arrow branching away to show the loss of C O 2.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_jX4Mf90sT6">In the glyoxylate cycle, acetyl-CoA condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate, and citrate is converted to isocitrate, exactly as in the citric acid cycle.

The malate is subsequently oxidized to oxaloacetate, which can condense with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to start another turn of the cycle.

As addition of further glucose residues lengthens the chain, it is extruded through a channel formed by the transmembrane helices of cellulose synthase and, on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, joins growing chains from neighboring cellulose synthase molecules to form a cellulose microfibril. Polymers of more than 6 to 8 glucose units are insoluble in water, promoting microfibril crystallization.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nSPVtMi69S">Each of the six particles of the rosette most likely contains three cellulose synthase molecules, each synthesizing a single cellulose chain (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_7lDqQgGYL5" role="presentation" src="../images/2.png"/>). The large enzyme complex that catalyzes this process moves along the plasma membrane with directionality often related to the course of microtubules in the cell cortex, the cytoplasmic layer just below the membrane (step <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_ZxrRpPm3e7" role="presentation" src="../images/3.png"/>). When these microtubules lie perpendicular to the axis of the plant’s growth, the cellulose microfibrils are laid down similarly to promote elongation. The motion of the cellulose synthase complexes is believed to be driven by energy released in the polymerization reaction, not by a molecular motor such as kinesin.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_DocCfQNU0N">The fundamental cellulose microfibril made by one rosette-type cellulose synthesis complex is thought to be composed of 18 chains lying side by side with the same (parallel) orientation of nonreducing and reducing ends.

Sucrose, synthesized from UDP-glucose and fructose, is exported from leaf mesophyll cells to the plant phloem; the resulting high sucrose content draws water into the phloem by osmosis. The resulting increased turgor pressure (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch02_02.xhtml#page52" id="dav_9781319322342_viJrEQbGQc">p. 52</a>) pushes the solution in the phloem toward sink tissues.

Outside of the cell, an arrow labeled invertase points from sucrose to glucose plus fructose. Glucose travels through a glucose-H plus symporter that also transports H plus to enter the cell, where it can react with fructose. An arrow labeled sucrose synthase points left from sucrose that entered the cell through the lower sucrose-H plus symporter to the reaction of U D P-glucose plus fructose, from which an arrow points up to glycolysis. From U D P-glucose, an arrow points to cellulose synthesis to the upper left and to starch synthesis to the lower left. A vacuole is shown as a vertical oval to the left.
