<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_vaWNE5uQNN">Two generalizations have emerged from studies of signaling systems such as those we have discussed so far. First, protein kinases that phosphorylate Tyr, Ser, and Thr residues — and phosphatases that dephosphorylate them — are central to signaling, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_BarVY5Posu">directly</i> affecting the activities of a large number of protein substrates. <span class="keep" id="dav_9781319322342_JvDOquLrob"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_k2ZhvFOweI" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> Second,</span> protein-protein interactions brought about by the reversible phosphorylation of Tyr, Ser, and Thr residues in signaling proteins create <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_nBktx8nbct">docking sites</i> for other proteins that bring about <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_N5nCZA6IWJ">indirect</i> effects on proteins downstream in the signaling pathway. In fact, many signaling proteins are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_TD1c29KKZS">multivalent</i>: they can interact with several different proteins simultaneously to form multiprotein signaling complexes. In this section we present a few examples to illustrate the general principles of phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions in signaling pathways.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_QTJkHHKKQR">Many of the proteins involved in signaling have intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are flexible enough to allow specific interaction with more than one protein — and perhaps with many other proteins. Protein kinases, for example, have a well-conserved structure containing the substrate-binding and catalytic sites, but through evolution they have acquired additional sequences, typically 20–30 residues long, that are partially disordered and can fold to fit into various multienzyme regulatory networks. The activation loop found in most protein kinases is an IDR and is the universal regulator of kinase activity; its position changes when one or several residues become phosphorylated, switching on the kinase activity. Protein kinases of the PKA, PKB, and PKC families have a disordered carboxyl-terminal tail containing critical residues whose phosphorylation state switches between active and inactive kinase structures. In the MAPK cascade, an amino-terminal IDR plays a similar role as a docking site in the multienzyme complex. Given the ~1,000 protein kinase genes in humans, the many noncatalytic scaffold proteins, and the multiple interactions possible for IDRs in many of these proteins, the number of possible permutations and combinations available for switching and regulating metabolic processes by protein phosphorylation is impressively large.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_WgldQRvIB4">In summary, a remarkable picture of signaling pathways has emerged from studies of many signaling proteins and their multiple binding domains. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_7Os09DZpe2" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG02.png"/> An initial signal results in phosphorylation of the receptor or a target protein, triggering the assembly of large multiprotein complexes, held together on scaffolds with multivalent binding capacities. Some of these complexes contain several protein kinases that activate each other in turn, producing a cascade of phosphorylation and a great amplification of the initial signal. The interactions between cascade kinases are not left to the vagaries of random collisions in three-dimensional space. In the MAPK cascade, for example, a scaffold protein, KSR, binds all three kinases (MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK), ensuring their proximity and correct orientation and even conferring allosteric properties on the interactions among the kinases, which makes their serial phosphorylation sensitive to very small stimuli (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_tUIOHD5P3j"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_TAOm0xlPnO" id="dav_9781319322342_W3blYAujkV">Fig. 12-31</a></strong>).</p>

With the binding of all three in appropriate orientations, interactions among the proteins are rapid and efficient. When ERK has been activated (left), it phosphorylates the binding site for Raf (right), forcing a conformational change that displaces Raf and thereby prevents the phosphorylation of MEK. The result of this feedback regulation is that MEK phosphorylation is temporary. <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_wMjUu6OZsF">(b)</strong> In yeast cells with mutant KSR lacking the phosphorylation sites (red curve), no feedback occurs, producing a different time course of signaling.

A thin light green arrow points down to text reading, weak output. Part b shows a graph that plots time on the horizontal axis against M E K phosphorylation on the vertical axis. Two curves are plotted on the graph. Both curves begin at the origin and move almost diagonally upward at first. The black curve labeled wild type begins to slow at almost one-quarter of the length of the horizontal axis and almost half the height of the vertical axis, then peaks at one-quarter of the length of the horizontal axis and half the height of the vertical axis before decreasing slowly to end at one-third of the height of the vertical axis. The red curve labeled K S R mutant lacking E R K phosphorylation sites continues to rise above the wild type curve and begins to slow just above one-quarter of the length of the horizontal axis and half the height of the vertical axis. It levels off at almost one-third of the length of the horizontal axis and three-quarters of the height of the vertical axis and runs horizontally to end at the right side of the graph.

At least 37 genes in the human genome encode protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). About half of these are receptorlike integral proteins with a single transmembrane domain; they are presumably controlled by extracellular factors not yet identified. Other PTPs are soluble and contain SH2 domains that determine their molecular partners and intracellular location. In addition, animal cells have protein <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_3BQHTaV3Qr" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_13_PG_484a.png"/>–Ser and <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_J8thEbFHvQ" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_13_PG_484a.png"/>–Thr phosphatases such as PP1 that reverse the effects of Ser- and Thr-specific protein kinases.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_T6Er9CDUTc">We can see, then, that signaling occurs in protein circuits, which are effectively hardwired from signal receptor to response effector and can be switched off instantly by the hydrolysis of a single upstream phosphate ester bond. In these circuits, protein kinases are the writers, domains such as SH2 are the readers, and PTPs and other phosphatases are the erasers. The multivalency of signaling proteins allows the assembly of many different combinations of Lego-like signaling modules, each combination suited to particular signals, cell types, and metabolic circumstances, yielding diverse signaling circuits of extraordinary complexity.</p>

By segregating in a small region of the plasma membrane all of the elements required for responding to and ending the signal, the cell is able to produce a highly localized and brief “puff” of second messenger.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ttA4Nejtcn">Some RTKs (EGFR and PDGFR) are also localized in rafts, and this sequestration very likely has functional significance. In isolated fibroblasts, EGFR is usually concentrated in specialized rafts called caveolae (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_kUJH9V28DT" id="dav_9781319322342_hef0ZrLC2U">Fig. 11-23</a>). When the cells are treated with EGF, the receptor leaves the raft, separating it from the other components of the EGF signaling pathway. This migration depends on the receptor’s protein kinase activity; mutant receptors lacking this activity remain in the raft during treatment with EGF. Such experiments suggest that spatial segregation of signaling proteins in rafts is yet another dimension of the already complex processes initiated by extracellular signals.</p>
