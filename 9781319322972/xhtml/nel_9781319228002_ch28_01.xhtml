<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_IHtMNNLmi8">Biological information is expensive. We have discussed the extraordinary energetic cost of replication, transcription, and translation in previous chapters. The ATP requirements of converting information from a gene in a chromosome to protein imposes a need for efficiency, explaining the pervasive and often complex regulation of the expression of every gene.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_MU6fFVTYUl">Of the 4,000 or so genes in the typical bacterial genome, or the 20,000 genes in the human genome, only a fraction are expressed in a cell at any given time. Some gene products are present in very large amounts: the elongation factors required for protein synthesis, for example, are among the most abundant proteins in bacteria, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) of plants and photosynthetic bacteria is one of the most abundant enzymes in the biosphere. Other gene products occur in much smaller amounts; for instance, a cell may contain only a few molecules of the enzymes that repair rare DNA lesions. Requirements for some gene products change over time. The need for enzymes in certain metabolic pathways may wax and wane as food sources change or are depleted. During development of a multicellular organism, some proteins that influence cellular differentiation are present for just a brief time in only a few cells. Specialization of cellular function can greatly affect the need for various gene products; an example is the uniquely high concentration of a single protein — hemoglobin — in erythrocytes. It is clear from these examples that the appearance of gene products must be regulated. Our exploration of the regulation of gene expression is once again guided by multiple principles:</p>

These processes are a major focus of this chapter, although we also consider other mechanisms. As noted in earlier chapters, the complexity of an organism is not reflected in the number of its protein-coding genes. Instead, as complexity increases from bacteria to mammals, mechanisms of gene regulation become more elaborate, and posttranscriptional and translational regulation play greater roles.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_XUpa21FMOh">Control of transcription initiation permits the synchronized regulation of multiple genes encoding products with interdependent activities. For example, when their DNA is heavily damaged, bacterial cells require a coordinated increase in the levels of the many DNA repair enzymes. And perhaps the most sophisticated form of coordination occurs in the complex regulatory circuits that guide the development of multicellular eukaryotes, which can include many types of regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ydActhSwAH">We begin by examining the interactions between proteins and DNA that are the key to transcriptional regulation. We next discuss the specific proteins that influence the expression of specific genes, first in bacterial and then in eukaryotic cells. Information about posttranscriptional and translational controls is included in the discussion, where relevant, to provide a more complete overview of the rich complexity of cellular regulation.</p>
