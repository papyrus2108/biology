<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_syu9O8bKu1">Initiation of transcription is a crucial regulation point for gene expression in all organisms. Although eukaryotes and bacteria use some of the same regulatory mechanisms, the regulation of transcription in the two systems is fundamentally different.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_tZv9x8D8tQ"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_dlwBcKLCXq" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> We can define a transcriptional ground state as the inherent activity of promoters and transcriptional machinery in vivo in the absence of regulatory sequences. In bacteria, RNA polymerase generally has access to every promoter and can bind and initiate transcription at some level of efficiency in the absence of activators or repressors. In eukaryotes, however, strong promoters are generally inactive in vivo in the absence of regulatory proteins. This fundamental difference gives rise to at least five important features that distinguish the regulation of gene expression at eukaryotic promoters from that observed in bacteria.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4T9W2HNI7j">First, access to eukaryotic promoters is restricted by the structure of chromatin, and activation of transcription is associated with many changes in chromatin structure in the transcribed region. Second, although eukaryotic cells have both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms, positive mechanisms are more prominent. Almost every eukaryotic gene requires activation to be transcribed. Third, regulatory mechanisms involving lncRNAs are more common in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. Fourth, eukaryotic cells have larger, more complex multimeric regulatory proteins than do bacteria. Finally, transcription in the eukaryotic nucleus is separated from translation in the cytoplasm in both space and time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_hCIFWt0ylX">The complexity of regulatory circuits in eukaryotic cells is extraordinary, as is evident from the following discussion. The section ends with an illustrated description of one of the most elaborate circuits: the regulatory cascade that controls development in fruit flies.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_jMQzay6tVV">The effects of chromosome structure on gene regulation in eukaryotes have no clear parallel in bacteria. In the eukaryotic cell cycle, interphase chromosomes appear, at first viewing, to be dispersed and amorphous (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fBE8VEFeEr" id="dav_9781319322342_EUL3WHPEHm">Fig. 24-22</a>). Nevertheless, several forms of chromatin can be found along these chromosomes. About 10% of the chromatin in a typical eukaryotic cell is in a more condensed form than the rest of the chromatin. This form, <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_DrrvCV3cHY">heterochromatin</strong>, is transcriptionally inactive. Heterochromatin is generally associated with particular chromosome structures — the centromeres, for example. The remaining, less condensed chromatin is called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_3LNNTJTn3y">euchromatin</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_CwNllAj8o1">Transcription of a eukaryotic gene is strongly repressed when its DNA is condensed within heterochromatin. Some, but not all, of the euchromatin is transcriptionally active. Transcriptionally active chromosomal regions are distinguished from heterochromatin in at least three ways: the positioning of nucleosomes, the presence of histone variants, and the covalent modification of nucleosomes. These transcription-associated structural changes in chromatin are collectively called <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_W8isfsVUxO">chromatin remodeling</dfn>. The remodeling employs a set of enzymes that promote these changes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_cvofCv2U81" id="dav_9781319322342_4ulwstGyJM"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_o1bJjHeGKB">Table 28-2</strong></a>).</p>

They may unwrap, translocate, remove, or exchange nucleosomes on the DNA, hydrolyzing ATP in the process (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_cvofCv2U81" id="dav_9781319322342_ruOxf15Uto">Table 28-2</a>; see the table footnote for an explanation of the abbreviated names of enzyme complexes described here). In some cases, the enzymes catalyze the exchange of pairs of histones within nucleosomes to alter nucleosome composition.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ynjw08urt3">As already noted, eukaryotic RNA polymerases have little or no intrinsic affinity for their promoters. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_JILvxErEM8" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01d.png"/> The default state of eukaryotic genes is “off,” and initiation of transcription is almost always dependent on the action of multiple activator proteins. One important reason for the apparent predominance of positive regulation seems obvious: the storage of DNA within chromatin effectively renders most promoters inaccessible, so genes are silent in the absence of other regulation. The structure of chromatin affects access to some promoters more than others, but repressors that bind to DNA so as to preclude access of RNA polymerase (negative regulation) would often be simply redundant. Other factors must be at play in the use of positive regulation, and speculation generally centers around two: the large size of eukaryotic genomes and the greater efficiency of positive regulation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_RAK7eMf2N1">First, nonspecific DNA binding of regulatory proteins becomes a more important problem in the much larger genomes of higher eukaryotes. And the chance that a single specific binding sequence will occur randomly at an inappropriate site also increases with genome size. Combinatorial control thus becomes important in a large genome (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_iYnJKr6rh0"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_t1d1kkUBkF" id="dav_9781319322342_rMTLF38OTt">Fig. 28-29</a></strong>). Specificity for transcriptional activation can be improved if each of several positive regulatory proteins must bind specific DNA sequences to activate a gene. The average number of regulatory sites for a gene in a multicellular organism is six, and genes that are regulated by a dozen such sites are common. The requirement for binding of several positive regulatory proteins to specific DNA sequences vastly reduces the probability of the random occurrence of a functional juxtaposition of all the necessary binding sites. This requirement also reduces the number of regulatory proteins that must be encoded by a genome to regulate all of its genes (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_uPJBwDCqJc" id="dav_9781319322342_JNEmuxdLRO">Fig. 28-28</a>). Thus, a new regulator is not needed for every gene, although regulation is complex enough in higher eukaryotes that regulatory proteins may represent 5% to 10% of all protein-coding genes.</p>

Consider the possibilities inherent in regulation by two different families of leucine zipper proteins (red and green). If each regulatory gene family had three members (as shown here, in dark, medium, and light shades, each binding to a different DNA sequence) that could freely form either homo- or heterodimers, there would be six possible dimeric species in each family and each dimer would recognize a different bipartite regulatory DNA sequence. If a gene had a regulatory site for each protein family, 36 different regulatory combinations would be possible, using just the six proteins from these two families. With six or more sites used in the regulation of a typical eukaryotic gene, the number of possible variants is much greater than this example suggests.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6p8GBHyvxJ">In principle, a similar combinatorial strategy could be used by multiple negative regulatory elements, but this brings us to the second reason for the use of positive regulation: it is simply more efficient. If the ~20,000 genes in the human genome were negatively regulated, each cell would have to synthesize, at all times, all of the different repressors in concentrations sufficient to permit specific binding to each “unwanted” gene. In positive regulation, most of the genes are usually inactive (that is, RNA polymerases do not bind to the promoters) and the cell synthesizes only the activator proteins needed to promote transcription of the subset of genes required in the cell at that time.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_XVpjlq7Eef">Part a is labeled activation. A double-stranded piece of D N A, shown as two blue strands, begins at the upper left and curves counterclockwise down to the lower right. At just past the twelve o’clock position, the D N A has two dark blue segments (one on the top strand and one on the bottom strand) labeled U A S above two vertical purple bars lined up adjacent beneath the bottom strand. Two wavy green lines labeled L n c R N A are shown with a dashed arrow pointing to the left-hand purple bar. Between the nine and eleven o’clock positions, four brown crescent-shaped H M G proteins are aligned sequentially along the D N A. At the lower left, the D N A has two blue segments in the top and bottom strands with two brown crescent-shaped structures on the inside curved so that they are open above each blue bar with ends on either side of each bar. A purple piece above the two crescent-shaped structure is roughly oval with cutouts that fit against the crescent shaped structures. A second set of blue bars and accompanying structures is adjacent. The crescents and purple pieces are labeled, transcription activators and coactivators. The D N A continues across the bottom of the structure to two diagonal lines representing a cut, then reaches a P o l Roman numeral 2 initiation complex. The D N A curves upward and has a purple T A T A region just before it bends horizontally and then becomes dark yellow as it runs out to the right. After leaving the complex, the D N A has two diagonal lines separating it above the word gene. Pol Roman numeral 2 is shown behind many structures and provides the opening through which the D N A travels. A horizontal oval piece with a rounded cutout in the bottom runs across the T A T A box. A crescent-shaped green structure is beneath the T A T A box and opens to the left. To the right of the T A T A box, there is a brown protrusion from the upper right of a rounded structure with its base in front of a darker brown oval that protrudes upward across the dark yellow D N A in the middle of the polymerase. Behind it and extending to the right, there is a yellow rounded structure with a rounded cutout in the bottom labeled T F I I D that extends up behind the D N A. An irregular gray piece extends over the top of it and over the polymerase. It has a rounded square protrusion to the right and a long horizontal protrusion to the left that meets the top of a narrow curved purple structure that resembles an inverted “C”. The polymerase has a thin diagonal protrusion at the upper left labeled C T D. A short vertical line points upward from the blue D N A where it becomes dark yellow and meets a horizontal arrow pointing right beneath the green word O N. Many green arrows are shown. A green arrow points down from a purple bar beneath U A S to T F I I D. A second arrow points from the other purple bar to a large blue structure with a roughly linear shape that runs diagonally from the lower left to upper right, where it bends to the lower right. An arrow points from this to C T D, the protrusion to the upper left of Pol Roman numeral 2. An arrow points from one of the sets of transcription activators and coactivators at the lower left to the same large blue structure. An arrow points from the second of these transcription factors and coactivators to T F I I D. An arrow points from T F I I D to T B P. Part b is labeled repression. The structures shown are similar, but different arrows are present. Two red ovals are shown side by side above two wavy green lines. Accompanying text reads, repressors and / or l n c R N As. A red arrow points from one of the green wavy lines to the transcription activators and coactivators at the lower left. A red arrow points from one red oval to one of the purple bars beneath U A S and an arrow points from the other red oval to the large blue linear structure in the center. Red arrows also point from the ovals to T B P and to T R I I D. The short vertical line still extends up from the place where the blue D N A becomes dark yellow and meets a horizontal line pointing to the right, but red text above reads O F F. Part c shows a curved brown structure containing many helices labeled H M G domain. D N A extends beneath this brown structure, extending away from the viewer and into its lower right side. All data are approximate.</p>

A few are known to activate transcription at hundreds of promoters, whereas others are specific for a few promoters. Many activators are sensitive to the binding of signal molecules, providing the capacity to activate or deactivate transcription in response to a changing cellular environment. Some enhancers bound by activators are quite distant from the promoter’s TATA box. Multiple enhancers (often six or more) are bound by a similar number of activators for a typical gene, providing combinatorial control and response to multiple signals.</p>

Many of the 25 core polypeptides are highly conserved from fungi to humans. A subcomplex of four subunits has a kinase role, interacting transiently with the remainder of the Mediator complex, and may dissociate prior to transcription initiation. Mediator binds tightly to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II. The Mediator complex is required for both basal and regulated transcription at many promoters used by Pol II, and it also stimulates phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH (a basal transcription factor). Transcription activators interact with one or more components of the Mediator complex, with the precise interaction sites differing from one activator to another. Coactivator complexes function at or near the promoter’s TATA box.</p>

This minimal PIC, however, is often insufficient for initiation of transcription and generally does not form at all if the promoter is obscured within chromatin.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_gmXMGrCI1z">Crucial remodeling of the chromatin then takes place in stages, facilitated by interactions between activators and HATs or enzyme complexes such as SWI/SNF, or both. In this way, a bound activator can draw in other components necessary for further chromatin remodeling to permit transcription of specific genes. The bound activators interact with the large Mediator complex. Mediator, in turn, provides an assembly surface for the binding of, first, TBP (or TFIID), then TFIIB, and then other components of the PIC, including Pol II. Mediator stabilizes the binding of Pol II and its associated transcription factors and greatly facilitates formation of the PIC. Complexity in these regulatory circuits is the rule rather than the exception, with multiple DNA-bound activators promoting transcription.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_MYgJInLUWd">The script can change from one promoter to another. For example, many promoters have a different set of recognition sequences and may not have a TATA box, and in multicellular eukaryotes the subunit composition of factors such as TFIID can vary from one tissue to another. However, most promoters seem to require a precisely ordered assembly of components to initiate transcription. The assembly process is not always fast. For some genes it may take minutes; for certain genes of higher eukaryotes, the process can take days.</p>

However, all the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_USIwXHNQmr">GAL</i> genes have similar promoters and are regulated coordinately by a common set of proteins. The promoters for the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_4Kfxty7hRG">GAL</i> genes consist of the TATA box and Inr sequences, as well as an upstream activator sequence <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_Tw1fhgTqdD" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mrow><mtext>UAS</mtext></mrow><mtext>G</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="left-parenthesis UAS Subscript upper G Baseline right-parenthesis" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch28_04EQ_0014.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> recognized by the transcription activator Gal4 protein (Gal4p). Regulation of gene expression by galactose entails an interplay between Gal4p and two other proteins, Gal80p and Gal3p. Gal80p forms a complex with Gal4p, preventing Gal4p from functioning as an activator of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_TZQx7Dc6YJ">GAL</i> promoters. When galactose is present, it binds Gal3p, which then interacts with the Gal80p-Gal4p complex and allows Gal4p to function as an activator at the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_sOWxBuTHYe">GAL</i> promoters. As the various galactose genes are induced and their products build up, Gal3p may be replaced with Gal1p (a galactokinase needed for galactose metabolism that also acts as a regulator) for sustained activation of the regulatory circuit.</p>

Transcription of these genes is regulated by the combined actions of the proteins Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p, with Gal4p playing the central role of transcription activator. The Gal4p-Gal80p complex is inactive. Binding of galactose to Gal3p leads to interaction of Gal3p with the Gal80p-Gal4p complex and activates Gal4p. The Gal4p subsequently recruits SAGA, Mediator, and TFIID to the galactose promoters, leading to recruitment of RNA polymerase II and initiation of transcription. Chromatin remodeling to allow transcription also requires a SWI/SNF complex.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ayUuHRY0tG">A blue double stranded piece of D N A begins vertically at the upper left, then curves to run horizontally. At the top, just to the right of the center, there are two dark blue regions in the D N A. Two pink circles labeled G a l 80 p are above two purple ovals labeled G a l 4 p that each angle outward from the center toward their bottoms. Purple stalks from these ovals extend up, pass through thicker bars, and then cross so that the left-hand oval has a small oval that binds to the right side of the top dark blue bar and the right-hand oval has a small oval that binds to the left side of the bottom dark blue bar. At the nine o’clock to seven o’clock positions, four crescent-shaped H M G proteins are aligned along the outer piece of D N A with their openings facing inward. Just to the right of the center of the bottom strand, there is a purple region labeled T A T A, then a small orange box labeled l n r shortly to its right. A series of three arrows point downward. From top to bottom, they are accompanied by text reading G a l 3 p plus galactose, S A G A, and S W I / S N F. This yields a similar structure in which there are two blue spheres labeled G a l 3 p between the pink circles and the D N A above. The right-hand circle is bound to a hexagon labeled galactose. To the left, a large green oval labeled S A G A has ovals that extend out to the left and right, two ovals that angle to the upper left and upper right above, and a rounded protrusion to the lower right. The right-hand oval protrusion runs behind the left-hand pink sphere and purple oval to the right. The left side and top left ovals overlap a gray sphere labeled S W I / S N F that runs behind the D N A above and has two vertical ovals that runs across the front of the D N A, each extending out toward its side of the circle. A series of three arrows point downward. From top to bottom, they are accompanied by text reading, mediator, T F I I D, and Pol Roman numeral 2. The lower right portion of the D N A has now bent upward so that the T A T A box runs vertically through the left side of Pol Roman numeral 2. Pol Roman numeral 2 is visible behind other structures with its curved left and upper left side visible including a thin protrusion to the upper left that overlaps the mediator. The mediator is a blue structure made up of many ovals that runs horizontally from the lower left to upper right before bending toward the lower right near its end. It overlaps the rounded protrusion down from S A G A. A brown horizontal oval with a rounded cutout runs across the T A T A box and a green crescent is behind it that bends on top so that its upper left reaches the mediator. To the right of the T A T A box, there is a brown protrusion from the upper right of a rounded structure with its base in front of a darker brown oval that protrudes upward across the D N A in the middle of the polymerase. Behind it and extending to the right, there is a yellow rounded structure with a rounded cutout in the bottom labeled T F I I D that extends up behind the D N A. An irregular gray piece extends over the top of it and over the polymerase. It has a rounded square protrusion to the right and a long horizontal protrusion to the left that meets the top of a narrow curved purple structure that resembles an inverted “C”. The orange region labeled l n r is in the center of the Pol Roman numeral 2. All data are approximate.</p>

Pol Roman numeral 2 is visible behind other structures with its curved left and upper left side visible including a thin protrusion to the upper left that overlaps the mediator. The mediator is a blue structure made up of many ovals that runs horizontally from the lower left to upper right before bending toward the lower right near its end. It overlaps the rounded protrusion down from S A G A. A brown horizontal oval with a rounded cutout runs across the T A T A box and a green crescent is behind it that bends on top so that its upper left reaches the mediator. To the right of the T A T A box, there is a brown protrusion from the upper right of a rounded structure with its base in front of a darker brown oval shown that is shown as a dashed outline that protrudes upward across the D N A in the middle of the polymerase. Behind it and extending to the right, there is a yellow rounded structure with a rounded cutout in the bottom labeled T F I I D that is shown with a dashed outline that extends up behind the D N A. An irregular gray piece labeled T F I I H extends over the top of it and over the polymerase. It has a rounded square protrusion to the right and a long horizontal protrusion to the left that meets the top of a narrow curved purple structure that resembles an inverted “C”. The orange region labeled l n r is in the center of the Pol Roman numeral 2. Near the center of the top horizontal strand of D N A, there are two dark segments of D N A labeled G C box with the base of a triangle labeled S p 1 extending downward. There are three letter “Q”s beneath this triangle with an arrow pointing to the mediator. To the left, there are two purple ovals labeled G a l 4 p that each angle toward the outside and meet at the top, where each has a stalk extending upward through a thicker region before they cross so that the small oval of the right-hand oval binds to the right of a blue segment on the top strand of D N A and the small oval of the left-hand oval binds to the left of the bottom strand. These blue bars are labeled U A S and one of the small ovals is labeled G A L. There are three minus symbols beneath the large purple ovals and an arrow points from these to the mediator. At the upper left corner, there are two dark segments of D N A with text above the outer segment reading C C A A T. A yellow half-circle labeled C T F I fits against the curve in the D N A with its rounded side facing outward, where there are three Ps with an arrow pointing to the mediator. At the lower left, there is a series of four brown crescent-shaped H M G proteins along the outer D N A strand that open inward. Part b shows a similar structure that is lacking the both the G a l 4 p and related structures and the yellow C T F I and related structures. Ut has a G C box with a triangle labeled S p 1 with its bottom vertex extending into a yellow half-circle with a slightly curved top labeled C T F I with three Ps beneath and an arrow pointing to the mediator.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_FlbF1xU5d7">The effects of steroid hormones (and of thyroid and retinoid hormones, which have a similar mode of action) provide additional well-studied examples of the modulation of eukaryotic regulatory proteins by direct interaction with molecular signals (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_08.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_9MOJX6nt1Z" id="dav_9781319322342_vkDlNb733w">Fig. 12-34</a>). Unlike other types of hormones, steroid hormones do not have to bind to plasma membrane receptors. Instead, they can interact with intracellular receptors that are transcription activators. Steroid hormones too hydrophobic to dissolve readily in the blood (estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol, for example) travel on specific carrier proteins from their point of release to their target tissues. In the target tissue, the hormone passes through the plasma membrane by simple diffusion. Once inside the cell, the hormone interacts with one of two types of steroid-binding nuclear receptor (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_XIjT3w1T4O"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_hkLAKxCSc4" id="dav_9781319322342_ysIFQk4x5y">Fig. 28-34</a></strong>). In both cases, the hormone-receptor complex acts by binding to highly specific DNA sequences called <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_uIjikPha3U">hormone response elements (HREs)</dfn>, thereby altering gene expression. Acting at these sites, the receptors act as transcription activators, recruiting coactivators and Pol II (plus its associated transcription factors) to trigger transcription of the gene.</p>

(a) Monomeric type I receptors (NR) are found in the cytoplasm, in a complex with the heat shock protein Hsp70. Receptors for estrogen, progesterone, androgens, and glucocorticoids are of this type. When the steroid hormone binds, the Hsp70 dissociates and the receptor dimerizes, exposing a nuclear localization signal. The dimeric receptor, with hormone bound, migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to a hormone response element (HRE) and acts as a transcription activator. The activity of the receptor can be repressed by binding to an lncRNA (such as GAS5), which competes directly with binding to the HRE. (b) Type II receptors, by contrast, are always in the nucleus, bound to an HRE in the DNA and to a corepressor that renders the receptor inactive. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) is of this type. The hormone migrates through the cytoplasm and diffuses across the nuclear membrane. In the nucleus it binds to a heterodimer consisting of the thyroid hormone receptor and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). A conformation change leads to dissociation of the corepressor, and the receptor then functions as a transcription activator.</p>

A curved nuclear envelope is shown halfway down and the region beneath the nuclear envelope is labeled nucleus. A hormone that resembles half of a rounded bar is shown above the membrane with an arrow pointing through the membrane to an N R – H s p 70 complex. This consists of a blue oval structure with a circular cutout at its upper left and a slight angled cutout below with a green rectangle to its left with a round protrusion at its lower left that extends into the blue structure. An arrow points down accompanied by an arrow that branches off to show the loss of H s p 70, the green structure. This yields the N R – hormone complex, which is shown as a blue structure with two rounded halves connected by a narrowing in the center with a cutout at the upper left that contains the red hormone. An arrow points down to show that this yields an N R dimer, which consists of two N R – hormone complexes joined together with opposite orientations, so that one has a hormone on the left and the other has the hormone on the right. An arrow points down through an opening in the nuclear envelope to show the N R dimer bound to a dark region labeled N R E on a blue horizontal strand of D N A. A green oval coactivator is angled to rest on top of the N R dimer and extend down to the D N A to its right. P o l Roman numeral 2 is shown to the right with the coactivator overlapping its left side. The D N A runs through the center of the polymerase, which has a curved base that extends up on the left to meet a smaller curved top portion. This produces a narrow opening to the upper left and a wider opening to the right. The polymerase has a thin protrusion tot het upper left. To the right of the polymerase, the D N A becomes yellow and is labeled target gene before becoming blue again. A short vertical line extends upward to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the green word ON. An arrow points upward from ON to a wavy green strand labeled m R N A, from which an arrow points through an opening in the nuclear envelope to m R N A in the cytoplasm. An arrow points from this m R N A to an irregularly shaped, roughly spherical gray proteins, from which an arrow points to text reading, change in cell function. Beneath the piece of D N A where the N R dimer is bound to H R E, an arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of l n c R N A. L n c R N A is shown as short vertical green pieces of D N A on either side of a long vertical structure with a loop at the end. This yields an N R dimer with l n c R N A in the middle, with the loop appearing above the top of the spheres where the hormones are bound at the base extending out from the bottom. A horizontal blue strand of D N A is shown below where a blue region labeled H R E on the left and a yellow region labeled target gene on the right. Where the blue region meets the yellow region, a short vertical line points up to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the red word OFF. Part b shows a similar cell with a similar hormone outside of the plasma membrane. An arrow points down from the hormone through the cytoplasm into the nucleus. A blue strand of D N A has a dark blue region on the left labeled H R E and a yellow region to the right labeled target gene. A pink vertical bar labeled R X R is next to an orange bar labeled T R with both attached to H R E with a red oval corepressor across their tops. A short vertical line extends up from the boundary between the blue region and the yellow region to a horizontal arrow pointing right to the red word OFF. An arrow points downward and splits, with one half pointing to the corepressor and the other half pointing to D N A with R X R and T R each bound to a hormone on their outward-facing side. These two bars are angled outward from the center and joined to a green coactivator, which is roughly oval with a rounded part at the top where it meets the two bars. Pol Roman numeral 2 is to the right just before the yellow target gene. A short vertical line extends up from the boundary between the blue region and the yellow region and meets a horizontal line pointing right to the green word ON. An arrow points up to a wavy green strand of m R N A, from which an arrow points up through the nuclear membrane to a similar wavy green strand of m R N A in the cytoplasm.

For example, in the ligand-binding region, the glucocorticoid receptor is only 30% similar to the estrogen receptor and 17% similar to the thyroid hormone receptor. The size of the ligand-binding region varies dramatically; in the vitamin D receptor it has only 25 amino acid residues, whereas in the mineralocorticoid receptor it has 603 residues.

GAS5 also inhibits activity of the closely related androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors. In addition, GAS5 interacts with and sequesters an miRNA called miR-21, which interacts with and inhibits the activity of some regulatory proteins that act as tumor suppressors. Expression of GAS5 is suppressed in a wide range of tumors, resulting in increased expression of steroid hormones, higher levels of active miR-21, and faster tumor growth. Low GAS5 levels thus correlate with worsened outcomes for cancer patients, making this lncRNA a subject of intense ongoing investigation.</p>

In contrast to the tight coupling of transcription and translation in bacteria, the transcripts generated in a eukaryotic nucleus must be processed and transported <span aria-label="1085" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1085" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to the cytoplasm before translation. This can impose a significant delay on the appearance of a protein. When a rapid increase in protein production is needed, a translationally repressed mRNA already in the cytoplasm can be activated for translation without delay. Translational regulation may play an especially important role in regulating certain very long eukaryotic genes (a few are measured in the millions of base pairs), for which transcription and mRNA processing can require many hours. Some genes are regulated at both the transcriptional and translational stages, with the latter playing a role in the fine-tuning of cellular protein levels. In some non-nucleated cells, such as reticulocytes (immature erythrocytes), transcriptional control is entirely unavailable and translational control of stored mRNAs becomes essential. As described below, translational controls can also have spatial significance during development, when the regulated translation of prepositioned mRNAs creates a local gradient of the protein product.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_eGAfvMaVwA">Translational regulation has been particularly well studied in reticulocytes. One such mechanism in these cells involves eIF2, the initiation factor that binds to the initiator tRNA and conveys it to the ribosome; when Met-tRNA has bound to the P site, the factor eIF2B binds to eIF2, recycling it with the aid of GTP binding and hydrolysis. The maturation of reticulocytes includes destruction of the cell nucleus, leaving behind a plasma membrane packed with hemoglobin. Messenger RNAs deposited in the cytoplasm before the loss of the nucleus allow for the replacement of hemoglobin. When reticulocytes become deficient in iron or heme, the translation of globin mRNAs is repressed. A protein kinase called <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_03TVZjbxcD">HCR (hemin-controlled repressor)</strong> is then activated, catalyzing the phosphorylation of eIF2. When phosphorylated, eIF2 forms a stable complex with eIF2B that sequesters the eIF2, making it unavailable for participation in translation. In this way, the reticulocyte coordinates the synthesis of globin with the availability of heme.</p>

The technique is an important tool in the ongoing efforts to study gene function, because it can disrupt gene function without creating a mutant organism. The procedure can be applied to humans as well. Laboratory-produced siRNAs have been used to block HIV and poliovirus infections in cultured human cells for a week or so at a time. The wider application of RNAi-based pharmaceuticals was initially stymied by the difficulty inherent in delivering RNAi molecules to their required target, given the many nucleases that degrade RNA in human tissues. With recent advances in delivery methods, there are now more than a dozen RNAi pharmaceuticals in advanced clinical trials to treat a range of conditions, from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy to viral infections and cancer.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_DvfF959ZaB">All RNAs (regardless of their length) that do not encode proteins, including rRNAs and tRNAs, come under the general designation of ncRNAs. Mammalian genomes encode more ncRNAs than coding mRNAs. The ncRNAs in eukaryotes include miRNAs, described above; snRNAs, involved in RNA splicing (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_LNOQp9Zuif" id="dav_9781319322342_es7ZPxA8WU">Fig. 26-16</a>); snoRNAs, involved in rRNA modification (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Tj6LM1OdrH" id="dav_9781319322342_rVSjxChnDD">Fig. 26-24</a>); and lncRNAs, already encountered in this chapter. Not surprisingly, additional functional classes of ncRNAs are still being discovered. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_P8tbbueQ4u" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01b.png"/> Here we describe a few more examples of ncRNAs that participate in gene regulation, which are designated lncRNAs when their length exceeds 200 nucleotides.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_DLDXkYbzZP">Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is an activator protein that, in nonstressed cells, exists as a monomer bound by the chaperone Hsp90. Under stress conditions, HSF1 is released from Hsp90 and trimerizes. The HSF1 trimer binds to DNA and activates transcription of genes encoding products required to deal with the stress. An lncRNA called HSR1 (heat shock RNA 1; ∼600 nucleotides) stimulates HSF1 trimerization and DNA binding. HSR1 does not act alone; it functions in a complex with the translation elongation factor eEF1A.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_55tABhcvI7">Additional RNAs affect transcription in a variety of ways. A 331 nucleotide lncRNA called 7SK, abundant in mammals, binds to the Pol II transcription elongation factor pTEFb (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Xkl2sYsv8X" id="dav_9781319322342_olW7mGywoU">Table 26-2</a>) and represses transcript elongation. The ncRNA B2 (∼178 nucleotides) binds directly to Pol II during heat shock and represses transcription. The B2-bound Pol II assembles into stable PICs, but transcription is blocked. The mechanism that allows HSF1-responsive genes to be expressed in the presence of B2 remains to be worked out.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_SjD2RfSvz9">The recognized roles of ncRNAs in gene expression and in many other cellular processes are rapidly expanding. At the same time, the study of the biochemistry of gene regulation is becoming much less protein-centric.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Zgw8GGX7zC">For sheer complexity and intricacy of coordination, the patterns of gene regulation that bring about development of a zygote into a multicellular animal or plant have no peer. Development requires transitions in morphology and protein composition that depend on tightly coordinated changes in expression of the genome. More genes are expressed during early development than in any other part of the life cycle. For example, in the sea urchin, an oocyte has about 18,500 <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_1EWuD9aFVA">different</i> mRNAs, compared with about 6,000 different mRNAs in the cells of a typical differentiated tissue. The mRNAs in the oocyte give rise to a cascade of events that regulate the expression of many genes across both space and time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_qmVUKl5Tsl">Several organisms have emerged as important model systems for the study of development, because they are easy to maintain in a laboratory and have relatively short generation times. These include nematodes, fruit flies, zebra fish, mice, and the plant <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_RMLO4amarz">Arabidopsis</i>.

As the egg cell forms (before fertilization), mRNAs and proteins originating in the nurse and follicle cells are deposited in the egg cell, where some play a critical role in development. Once a fertilized egg is laid, its nucleus divides and the nuclear descendants continue to divide in synchrony every 6 to 10 min. Plasma membranes are not formed around the nuclei, which are distributed within the egg cytoplasm, forming a syncytium. Between the eighth and eleventh rounds of nuclear division, the nuclei migrate to the outer layer of the egg, forming a monolayer of nuclei surrounding the common yolk-rich cytoplasm; this is the syncytial blastoderm. After a few additional divisions, membrane invaginations surround the nuclei to create a layer of cells that form the cellular blastoderm. At this stage, the mitotic cycles in the various cells lose their synchrony. The developmental fate of the cells is determined by the mRNAs and proteins originally deposited in the egg by the nurse and follicle cells.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_7jI2hNGPHg">If all cells divided to produce two identical daughter cells, multicellular organisms would never be more than a ball of identical cells. A key event in very early development is establishment of mRNA and protein gradients along the body axes, producing asymmetric cell divisions and different cell fates. Some maternal mRNAs have protein products that diffuse through the cytoplasm to create an asymmetric distribution in the egg. Different cells in the cellular blastoderm therefore inherit different amounts of these proteins, setting the cells on different developmental paths. An example is the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_En5Kd2i9tz">bicoid</i> gene. The <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Pp0LPqRorZ">bicoid</i> gene product is a major anterior morphogen. The mRNA from the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_lKw58vYsY5">bicoid</i> gene is synthesized by nurse cells and deposited in the unfertilized egg near its anterior pole. Translated soon after fertilization, the Bicoid protein diffuses through the cell to create, by the seventh nuclear division, a concentration gradient radiating out from the anterior pole (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_ruknB3kwfK"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_c1e79a6BsI" id="dav_9781319322342_iVDM2iTwNr">Fig. 28-40</a></strong>). The Bicoid protein contains a homeodomain (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_02.xhtml#page1062" id="dav_9781319322342_vRYivtqAbi">p. 1062</a>), encoded by a gene sequence motif called a homeobox and found in many proteins involved in regulating development. Bicoid is multifunctional — a transcription factor that activates the expression of several segmentation genes and also a translational repressor that inactivates certain mRNAs. The amount of Bicoid protein in various parts of the embryo increases or decreases the expression of other genes in a threshold-dependent manner. As its concentration varies along its gradient, interactions of the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_DqLXIVFdJm">bicoid</i> gene product with proteins and RNAs encoded by the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_FUJhg0HkDq">nanos, pumilio, caudal, hunchback</i>, and other regulatory genes also vary to produce different effects along the axis of the developing organism.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_OCLfgTKRxZ">The many regulatory genes in these three classes direct the development of an adult fly, with a head, thorax, and abdomen, with the proper number of segments, and with the correct appendages on each segment. Although embryogenesis takes about a day to complete, all these genes are activated during the first four hours. Some mRNAs and proteins are present for only a few minutes at specific points during this period. Some of the genes code for transcription factors that affect the expression of other genes in a kind of developmental cascade. Regulation at the level of translation also occurs, and many of the regulatory genes encode translational repressors, most of which bind to the <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_LwXlLmKm0n" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><msup><mn>3</mn><mo>′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="3 prime" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch28_04EQ_0060.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span>UTR of the mRNA (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RWgQ31bugN" id="dav_9781319322342_MTlju4g0mv">Fig. 28-36</a>). <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_5Rvg3R8eTP" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01a.png"/> Because many mRNAs are deposited in the egg long before their translation is required, translational repression provides an especially important avenue for regulation in developmental pathways.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LOeA4OOGMP">Many of the principles of development outlined above apply to other eukaryotes, from nematodes to humans. Some of the regulatory proteins are conserved. For example, the products of the homeobox-containing genes <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_LRdZtvQ2lL">HOXA7</i> in mouse and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_ck5BtuAgSt">antennapedia</i> in fruit fly differ in only one amino acid residue. Of course, although the molecular regulatory mechanisms may be similar, many of the ultimate developmental events are not conserved (humans do not have wings or antennae). The different outcomes are brought about by differences in the downstream target genes controlled by the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_O53LcxflOg">Hox</i> genes. The discovery of structural determinants with identifiable molecular functions is the first step in understanding the molecular events underlying development.

An adult human has many different types of tissues. Many of the cells are terminally differentiated and no longer divide. If an organ malfunctions due to disease, or a limb is lost <span aria-label="1090" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1090" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in an accident, the tissues are not readily replaced. Most cells, because of the regulatory processes in place, or even because of the loss of some or all of the genomic DNA, are not easily reprogrammed. Medical science has made organ transplants possible, but organ donors are a limited resource and organ rejection remains a major medical problem. If humans could regenerate their own organs or limbs or nervous tissue, rejection would no longer be an issue. Cures for kidney failure or neurodegenerative disorders could become reality.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nQQ5QVJ5BI">Other types of stem cells can potentially be used for medical benefit. In the adult organism, <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_J6Aljg9ZDG">adult stem cells</strong>, as products of additional differentiation, have a more limited potential for further development than do embryonic stem cells. For example, the hematopoietic stem cells of bone marrow can give rise to many types of blood cells and also to cells with the capacity to regenerate bone. They are referred to as <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_5Xq71p6Tw5">multipotent</strong>. However, these cells cannot differentiate into a liver or kidney or neuron. Adult stem cells are often said to have a <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_RWsapuPHlH">niche</strong>, a microenvironment that promotes stem cell maintenance while allowing differentiation of some daughter cells as replacements for cells in the tissue they serve (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_HdTaHXh4VF" id="dav_9781319322342_sl40dXDItu">Fig. 28-43b</a>). Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow occupy a niche in which signaling from neighboring cells and other cues maintain the stem cell lineage. At the same time, some daughter cells differentiate to provide needed blood cells. Understanding the niche in which stem cells operate, and the signals the niche provides, is essential in efforts to harness the potential of stem cells for tissue regeneration. The identification and culturing of pluripotent stem cells from human blastocysts was reported by James Thomson and colleagues in 1998. This advance led to the long-term availability of established cell lines for research.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_H5uXT0ZjD0">All stem cells present problems for human medical applications. Adult stem cells have a limited capacity to regenerate tissues, are generally present in small numbers, and are hard to isolate from an adult human. Embryonic stem cells have much greater differentiation potential and can be cultured to generate large numbers of cells, but their use is accompanied by ethical concerns related to the necessary destruction of human embryos. Identifying a source of plentiful and medically useful stem cells that does not raise such concerns remains a major goal of medical research.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_oq86rmdZvo">Our ability to culture stem cells (i.e., maintain them in an undifferentiated state), and to manipulate them to grow and differentiate into particular tissues, is very much a function of our understanding of developmental biology.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_12dwOjt0uE">Thus far, mouse and human embryonic stem cells have been used for most research. Although both types of stem cells are pluripotent, they require very different culture conditions, optimized to allow cell division indefinitely without differentiation. Mouse embryonic stem cells are grown on a layer of gelatin and require the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Human embryonic stem cells are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and require basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, or FGF2). The use of a feeder cell layer implies that the mouse cells are providing a diffusible product or some surface signal, not yet known, that is needed by human stem cells to either promote cell division or prevent differentiation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_mY0CXl24RZ">A significant advance, reported in 2007, centers on success in reversing differentiation. In effect, skin <span aria-label="1092" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1092" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cells — first from mice, then from humans — have been reprogrammed to take on the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells. The reprogramming involves manipulations to get the cells to express at least four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28, all of which are known to help maintain the stem cell–like state. Gradual improvements in this technology may make the harvesting of embryonic stem cells unnecessary and provide a source of stem cells that is genetically matched to a prospective patient.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_RaUxCcGle3">South America has several species of seed-eating finches, commonly called grassquits. About 3 million years ago, a small group of grassquits, of a single species, took flight from the continent’s Pacific coast. Perhaps driven by a storm, they lost sight of land and traveled nearly 1,000 km. Small birds such as these might easily have perished on such a journey, but the smallest of chances brought this group to a newly formed volcanic island in an archipelago later to be known as the Galápagos. It was a virgin landscape with untapped plant and insect food sources, and the newly arrived finches survived. Over the years, new islands formed and were colonized by new plants and insects — and by the finches. The birds exploited the new resources on the islands, and groups of birds gradually specialized and diverged into new species. By the time Charles Darwin stepped onto the islands in 1835, many different finch species were to be found on the various islands of the archipelago, feeding on seeds, fruits, insects, pollen, or even blood.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_NEw1Mpn0en">The diversity of living creatures was a source of wonder for humans long before scientists sought to understand its origins. The extraordinary insight handed down to us by Darwin, inspired in part by his encounter with the Galápagos finches, provided a broad explanation for the existence of organisms with a vast array of appearances and characteristics. It also gave rise to many questions about the mechanisms underlying evolution. Answers to those questions have started to appear, first through the study of genomes and nucleic acid metabolism in the last half of the twentieth century, and more recently through an emerging field nicknamed evo-devo — a blend of evolutionary and developmental biology.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_NU9l9qF07k">In its modern synthesis, the theory of evolution has two main elements: mutations in a population generate genetic diversity; natural selection then acts on this diversity to favor individuals with more useful genomic tools and to disfavor others. Mutations occur at significant rates in every individual’s genome, in every cell (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch08_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_otHZtLrhUc" id="dav_9781319322342_e7aB0TKYfQ">Section 8.3</a>). Advantageous mutations in single-celled organisms or in the germ line of multicellular organisms can be inherited, and they are more likely to be inherited (that is, passed on to greater numbers of offspring) if they confer an advantage. It is a straightforward scheme. But many have wondered whether it is enough to explain, say, the many different beak shapes in the Galápagos finches or the diversity of size and shape among mammals. Until recent decades, there were several widely held assumptions about the evolutionary process: that many mutations and new genes would be needed to bring about a new physical structure, that more-complex organisms would have larger genomes, and that very different species would have few genes in common. All of these assumptions were wrong.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_ZwZOf7jYPg">Modern genomics has revealed that the human genome contains fewer genes than expected — not many more than the fruit fly genome and fewer than some amphibian genomes. The genomes of every mammal, from mouse to human, are surprisingly similar in the number, types, and chromosomal arrangement of genes. Meanwhile, evo-devo is telling us how complex and very different creatures can evolve within these genomic realities.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nEAxUwA9XL">In the late nineteenth century, English biologist William Bateson studied animals with homeotic mutations — creatures with body parts growing in the wrong location. Bateson used his observations to challenge the Darwinian notion that evolutionary change would have to be gradual. Recent studies of the genes that control organismal development have put an exclamation point on Bateson’s ideas. Subtle changes in regulatory patterns during development, reflecting just one or a few mutations, can result in startling physical changes and fuel surprisingly rapid evolution.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6gNupg4vBt">The Galápagos finches provide a wonderful example of the link between evolution and development. There are at least 14 (some specialists list 15) species of Galápagos finches, distinguished in large measure by their beak structure. The ground finches, for example, have broad, heavy beaks adapted to crushing large, hard seeds. The cactus finches have longer, slender beaks ideal for probing cactus fruits and flowers (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_KrO7aEYQef" id="dav_9781319322342_fYkYXRuVGB">Fig. 1</a>). Clifford Tabin and colleagues carefully surveyed a set of genes expressed during avian craniofacial development. They identified a single gene, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_GhKrwa6ch3">Bmp4</i>, whose expression level correlated with formation of the more robust beaks of the ground finches. More-robust beaks were also formed in chicken embryos when high levels of Bmp4 were artificially expressed in the appropriate tissues, confirming the importance of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_SbA3jii5Zy">Bmp4</i>. In a similar study, the formation of long, slender beaks was linked to the expression of calmodulin (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_S1tpclMwYk" id="dav_9781319322342_DoWWAYTc9D">Fig. 12-17</a>) in particular tissues at appropriate developmental stages. Thus, major changes in the shape and function of the beak can be brought about by subtle changes in the expression of just two genes involved in developmental regulation. Very few mutations are required, and the needed mutations affect regulation. New genes are <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Cf2VFp5WxO">not</i> required.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_XAiozQKN2S">The system of regulatory genes that guides development is remarkably conserved among all vertebrates. Elevated expression of <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_nxCbGzd9qk">Bmp4</i> in the right tissue at the right time leads to more-robust jaw parts in zebrafish. The same gene plays a key role in tooth development in mammals. The development of eyes is triggered by the expression of a single gene, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Ug0TBJ2SVv">Pax6</i>, in fruit flies and in mammals. The mouse <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Uh8lYhmOvS">Pax6</i> gene will trigger the development of fruit fly eyes in the fruit fly, and the fruit fly <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Difrzxjf3Z">Pax6</i> gene will trigger the development of mouse eyes in the mouse. In each organism, these genes are part of the much larger regulatory cascade that ultimately creates the correct structures in the correct locations in each organism. The cascade is ancient; for example, the <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_tSS2Nh9Zmp">Hox</i> genes (described in the text) have been part of the developmental program of multicellular eukaryotes for more than 500 million years. Subtle changes in the cascade can have large effects on development, and thus on the ultimate appearance, of the organism. These same subtle changes can fuel remarkably rapid evolution. For example, the 400 to 500 described species of cichlids (spiny-finned fish) in Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria on the African continent are all derived from one or a few populations that colonized each lake in the past 100,000 to 200,000 years. The Galápagos finches simply followed a path of evolution and change that living creatures have been traveling for billions of years.</p>
