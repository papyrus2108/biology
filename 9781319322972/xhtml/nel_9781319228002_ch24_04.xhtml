<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_NxbjA6kih7">The term “chromosome” is used to refer to a nucleic acid molecule that is the repository of genetic information in a virus, a bacterium, an archaeon, a eukaryotic cell, or an organelle. It also refers to the densely colored bodies seen in the nuclei of dye-stained eukaryotic cells undergoing mitosis, as visualized using a light microscope.</p>

In the S phase of interphase, the DNA in this amorphous state replicates, each chromosome producing two sister chromosomes (called sister chromatids) that remain associated with each other after replication is complete. The chromosomes become much more condensed during prophase of mitosis, taking the form of a species-specific number of well-defined pairs of sister chromatids (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dNfB1jy6cc" id="dav_9781319322342_mC3KQmOsP6">Fig. 24-5</a>).</p>

The duration of each phase varies with cell type and with growth conditions (for single-celled organisms) or metabolic state (for multicellular organisms); mitosis is typically the shortest phase. Cellular DNA is uncondensed throughout interphase, as shown in the cartoons of the nucleus. The interphase period can be divided into the G1 (gap) phase; the S (synthesis) phase, when the DNA is replicated; and the G2 phase, throughout which the replicated chromosomes (chromatids) cohere to one another. Mitosis can be divided into four stages. The DNA undergoes condensation in prophase. During metaphase, the condensed chromosomes line up in pairs along the plane halfway between the spindle poles. The two chromosomes of each pair are linked to different spindle poles via microtubules that extend between the spindle and the centromere. The sister chromatids separate at anaphase, each drawn toward the spindle pole to which it is connected. The process is completed in telophase. After cell division, the chromosomes decondense and the cycle begins anew.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_8M20cMceAN">A circle is shown with a wedge at the top colored in light purple and labeled mitosis. An arrow points clockwise across the top of this segment and its four parts are expanded to show detail above. From just past the twelve o’clock position, where the arrow for mitosis ends, a new arrow begins that points to the five o’clock position. This represents the G 1 part of the cycle and shows a cell with a light blue nucleus outlined by a dotted line and containing many thready structures. A short perpendicular line intersects the arrow just before it ends. A line from the five o’clock position to the ten o’clock position represents the S phase. This contains a similar cell except that it contains blue and red thready strands. An arrow from the ten o’clock position to just before the twelve o’clock position is labeled G 2 and shows a cell that is similar but contains only red thready lines. An inner circle that runs from the right end of the wedge for mitosis through all of the other cycles to end at the line at the end of the left wedge representing the start of mitosis is labeled interphase. The close-up of the parts of mitosis shows four approximately equal parts each with arrows pointing clockwise across the top. The first phase is prophase and shows a cell with three pairs of red thready strands representing chromosomes, a dashed line surrounding the nucleus, and two green circles on either side of the nucleus with strands extending out around them in all directions. The second phase is metaphase. The nucleus is absent. Three purple chromosomes are lined up horizontally across the center of the cell and each consists of two halves. The green circles have moved to opposite halves of the cell with the line of chromosomes in the middle and lines extend out farther from the green circles. The third part is anaphase. The chromosomes have separated. Each chromosome now has one half moving upward and one half moving downward. The chromosomes are being pulled by one part with the arms dragging behind, extending toward the nucleus. The strands from the green spheres extend fully across the center and join with these chromosomes. The fourth phase is telophase. The cell has almost separated into two cells with a band encircling the narrow region between them. New nuclei are forming and the chromosomes are present within them. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_tJiVMVABmB">Found in the chromatin of all eukaryotic cells, histones have molecular weights between 11,000 and 21,000 and are very rich in the basic amino acids arginine and lysine (together these make up about one-fourth of the amino acid residues). All eukaryotic cells have five major classes of histones, differing in molecular weight and amino acid composition (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_3ZkvjkMhxA"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_N0qDuyDgrZ" id="dav_9781319322342_QZlWMe2gGq">Table 24-5</a></strong>). The H3 histones are nearly identical in amino acid sequence in all eukaryotes, as are the H4 histones, suggesting strict conservation of their functions. For example, only 2 of 102 amino acid residues differ between the H4 histone molecules of peas and cows, and only 8 differ between the H4 histones of humans and yeast. Histones H1, H2A, and H2B show less sequence similarity across eukaryotic species.</p>

This 10,000-fold compaction is achieved by means of several levels of highly organized folding. Subjection of chromosomes to treatments that partially unfold them reveals a structure in which the DNA is bound tightly to beads of protein, often regularly spaced. The beads in this “beads-on-a-string” arrangement are complexes of histones and DNA. The bead plus the connecting DNA that leads to the next bead form the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of organization on which the higher-order packing of chromatin is built (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_J9lqn42ftd"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_y6jnI6s8ln" id="dav_9781319322342_lHTsSAVVGU">Fig. 24-24</a></strong>).

The top portion has yellow H 2 A at the top, purple H 3 to the right, green H 4 at the bottom, and red H 2 B to the left. The lower portion has green H 4 beneath purple H 3 above, purple H 3 beneath green H 4 above, and yellow H 2 A beneath red H 2 B above. An arrow points right to show the same structure with a strand of D N A wrapped around it. The strand of D N A begins at the upper right, coils counterclockwise around the top portion, reappears at the lower left, and wraps counterclockwise across the lower front before leaving the histone core. Part b shows a circular double helix of D N A surrounding helical structures inside. There are mostly purple helices with one green helix below to the upper right, a green helix above with purple helices below to the lower right, red helices to the left side with some gold helices visible below there and to the lower right, and gold helices to the upper right with a small amount of red, green, and purple visible below. Lines extend down from the left and right of the right-hand structure of part a to part c. This shows a blue double helix as a surface contour structure wrapped around internal portions with yellow at the top, red to the left, purple below, then green, then more purple. The double helix wraps counterclockwise around the top part, then emerges below to wrap counter clockwise around the bottom part before leaving. The colors of the bottom part are partially visible with red on the left then yellow, then purple. Part d has two parts labeled front view and side view. The front view shows a double helix wrapped around helices inside with purple helices at the top and outer sides, green at the right side, red below, yellow to the lower left, and green below the yellow helices to the lower left. Histone tails extend out from these helices. Counterclockwise from the top, a goldish yellow tail extends through the D N A up above at just past the twelve o’clock position, a long purple tail labeled H 3 extends out at the one o’clock position, a short green tail labeled H 4 extends out at the three o’clock position, a long red tail labeled H 2 B extends down at the five o’clock position, a short yellow tail labeled H 2 A extends down just before the six o’clock position, a similar tail extends down just after the six o’clock position a long red tail extends out from the seven o’clock position, a green tail extends out at the ten o’clock position, a long purple tail extends out at the eleven o’clock position, and a short yellow tail extends up just before the twelve o’clock position. The side view shows two vertical blue D N A helices extending up across the front of the structure. A large red portion is at the bottom to center of the structure. A brownish gold tail labeled H 2 A extends to the five o’clock position, a red tail labeled H 2 B extends diagonally to the lower left from the six o’clock position, a brownish gold tail extends out from the seven o’clock position, a green tail extends from the nine o’clock position and some D N A is visible between it and a brownish gold tail extending from the eleven o’clock position just beneath a long purple tail.

Extending out from the nucleosome core are the amino-terminal tails of the histones, which are intrinsically disordered (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_y6jnI6s8ln" id="dav_9781319322342_ueenLBwI0z">Fig. 24-24d</a>). Most of the histone modifications occur in these tails. The tails play a key role in forming contacts between nucleosomes in the chromatin (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_y6jnI6s8ln" id="dav_9781319322342_ACz4CbkFHn">Fig. 24-24e</a>).

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_blKWBTOxq5">A close inspection of the nucleosome structure reveals why eukaryotic DNA is underwound even though eukaryotic cells lack enzymes that underwind DNA. Recall that the solenoidal wrapping of DNA in nucleosomes is but one form of supercoiling that can be taken up by underwound (negatively supercoiled) DNA. The tight wrapping of DNA around the histone core requires the removal of about one helical turn in the DNA. When the protein core of a nucleosome binds in vitro to a relaxed closed-circular DNA, the binding introduces a negative supercoil. Because this binding process does not break the DNA or change the linking number, the formation of a negative solenoidal supercoil must be accompanied by a compensatory positive supercoil in the unbound region of the DNA (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_prbdTeIrWz"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch24_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_8OuhOJ3Sls" id="dav_9781319322342_uj8w6yIsGB">Fig. 24-25</a></strong>). As mentioned earlier, eukaryotic topoisomerases can relax positive supercoils. Relaxing the unbound positive supercoil leaves the negative supercoil fixed (through its binding to the nucleosome’s histone core) and results in an overall decrease in linking number. Indeed, topoisomerases have proved necessary for assembling chromatin from purified histones and closed-circular DNA in vitro.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_P4vUkDliEX">Like histone H3.3, H2AZ is associated with a distinct nucleosome deposition complex, and it is generally associated with chromatin regions involved in active transcription. Incorporation of H2AZ stabilizes the nucleosome octamer, but it impedes some cooperative interactions between nucleosomes that are needed to compact the chromosome. This leads to a more open chromosome structure that enables the expression of genes in the region where H2AZ is located. The gene encoding H2AZ is essential in mammals. In fruit flies, loss of H2AZ prevents development beyond the larval stage.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_lvPwAccg47">Two classes of bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors have been developed as antibiotics. The coumarins, including novobiocin and coumermycin A1, are natural products derived from <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_EsJiQ1VSzy">Streptomyces</i> species. They inhibit the ATP binding of the bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These antibiotics are not often used to treat infections in humans, but research continues to identify clinically effective variants.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_AqdwuyU2So">The quinolone antibiotics, also inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, first appeared in 1962 with the introduction of nalidixic acid. This compound had limited effectiveness and is no longer used clinically in the United States, but the continued development of this class of drugs eventually led to the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, exemplified by ciprofloxacin (Cipro). The quinolones act by blocking the last step of the topoisomerase reaction, the resealing of the DNA strand breaks. Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is one of the few antibiotics reliably effective in treating anthrax infections and is considered a valuable agent in protection against possible bioterrorism. Quinolones are selective for the bacterial topoisomerases, inhibiting the eukaryotic enzymes only at concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than the therapeutic doses.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Sj0YdgmlPp">In higher eukaryotes, the Y chromosome contains only a few genes. The X chromosome, in contrast, often contains more than a thousand genes, many essential for cell function and organismal development. Males have just one X chromosome, whereas females have two. Females thus could end up with a double dose of gene products, leading to a variety of potentially toxic outcomes. Mechanisms of gene dosage compensation vary among different groups of eukaryotes. In most mammals, dosage compensation is accomplished by X chromosome inactivation, randomly affecting just one of the two X chromosomes in a given cell. The effects of this can be seen in calico cats, all of which are female. Fur pigmentation genes are found on the X chromosome. When a cat inherits chromosomes with different pigmentation alleles on its two X chromosomes, its coloration patterns reflect the random inactivation of one or the other X chromosome in different sets of cells.</p>

On the left under G 1, a vertical blue chromosome is shown with a yellow oval centromere near the center. As the S phase begins, two loops labeled cohesion are added. These are shown as loops with one purple strand and one green strand, a vertical oval at one end that is green on the side with the green strand and purple on the side with the purple strand, and a sphere at the other end that is green on the side with the green strand and purple on the side with the purple strand with two orange ovals attached and connected by a strand, with one oval on each half of the sphere.

The domains are topologically constrained; for example, if the DNA is cleaved in one domain, only the DNA within that domain will be relaxed. The domains do not have fixed end points. Instead, the boundaries are most likely in constant motion along the DNA, coordinated with DNA replication.</p>

The dynamic structural changes in the bacterial chromosome may reflect a requirement for more ready access to its genetic information. The bacterial cell division cycle can be as short as 15 min, whereas a typical eukaryotic cell may not divide for hours or even months. In addition, a much greater fraction of bacterial DNA is used to encode RNA and/or protein products. Higher rates of cellular metabolism in bacteria mean that a much higher proportion of the DNA is being transcribed or replicated at a given time than in most eukaryotic cells.</p>
