<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_KTrq1H5ll3">In our discussion of DNA and RNA synthesis up to this point, the role of the template strand has been reserved for DNA. However, some enzymes use an RNA template for nucleic acid synthesis. With the important exception of viruses with an RNA genome, these enzymes play only supporting roles in information pathways. RNA viruses are the source of most characterized RNA-dependent polymerases, although some eukaryotes also use these enzymes to amplify double-stranded RNAs used in RNA interference.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_K0fOFgWxJN">The existence of RNA replication requires an elaboration of the central dogma — the notion that genetic information flows only from DNA to RNA to proteins. RNA-dependent polymerases allow the genetic information stored in RNA to be replicated and reverse transcribed into DNA. The enzymes of the RNA replication process have profound implications for investigations into the nature of self-replicating molecules that may have existed in prebiotic times.</p>

On infection, the single-stranded RNA viral genome (∼10,000 nucleotides) and the enzyme enter the host cell.

The resulting duplex DNA often becomes incorporated into the genome of the eukaryotic host cell.

The purple segments represent the long terminal repeats on the viral RNA. The tRNA facilitates immediate conversion of viral RNA to double-stranded DNA by the action of reverse transcriptase. The double-stranded DNA enters the nucleus and is integrated into the host genome. The integration is catalyzed by a virally encoded integrase. Integration of viral DNA into host DNA is mechanistically similar to the insertion of transposons in bacterial chromosomes (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch25_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_0jv6Ory7eM" id="dav_9781319322342_2CrEEKTLSO">Fig. 25-41</a>). For example, a few base pairs of host DNA become duplicated at the site of integration, forming short repeats of 4 to 6 bp at each end of the inserted retroviral DNA (not shown). On transcription and translation of the integrated viral DNA, new viruses are formed and released by cell lysis (right). In the viruses, the viral RNA is enclosed by capsid proteins called Gag and outer envelope proteins called Env. Additional viral proteins (reverse transcriptase, integrase, and a viral protease needed for posttranslational processing of viral proteins) are packaged within the virus particle with the RNA.</p>

An arrow labeled transcription points to the right and shows that this produces a piece of R N A like the one in the virus, with a green center and purple ends. An arrow labeled transport out of nucleus shows that this moves back into the cytoplasm. A ribosome assembles around it with a large pink oval on top and purple oval on the bottom with strands of the R N A extending out from the left and right of the bottom oval. An arrow pointing right is labeled translation and proteolysis. Seven gray G a g spheres, a green E n v sphere, a purple reverse transcriptase sphere, a brown integrase sphere, and an orange protease sphere are shown above the arrow. A virus is shown to the right that resembles the complete virus except that it is missing part of its left side, where the green strand with purple ends is entering along with a green t R N A.

Identified in 1983, HIV has an RNA genome with standard retroviral genes along with several other unusual genes (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_BnOg7iaeZQ"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_zpB5PLXFLN" id="dav_9781319322342_e9GCPXU1x9">Fig. 26-32</a></strong>). Unlike many other retroviruses, HIV kills many of the cells it infects (principally T lymphocytes) rather than causing tumor formation. This gradually leads to suppression of the immune system in the host organism. The reverse transcriptase of HIV is even more error-prone than other known reverse transcriptases — 10 times more so — resulting in high mutation rates in this virus. One or more errors are generally made every time the viral genome is replicated, so any two viral RNA molecules are likely to differ.</p>

A few years after the isolation of HIV, this research resulted in the development of drugs capable of prolonging the lives of people infected by HIV.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_YK8Gsg57Wk">The first drug to be approved for clinical use was azidothymidine (AZT), a structural analog of deoxythymidine. AZT was first synthesized in 1964 by Jerome P. Horwitz. It failed as an anticancer drug (the purpose for which it was made), but in 1985 it was found to be a useful treatment for AIDS. AZT is taken up by T lymphocytes, immune system cells that are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, and it is converted to AZT triphosphate. (AZT triphosphate taken directly would be ineffective because it cannot cross the plasma membrane.) HIV’s reverse transcriptase has a higher affinity for AZT triphosphate than for deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and binding of AZT triphosphate to this enzyme competitively inhibits dTTP binding.

Unfortunately, AZT seems to be toxic to the bone marrow cells that are the progenitors of erythrocytes, and many individuals taking AZT develop anemia. AZT can increase the survival time of people with advanced AIDS by about a year, and it delays the onset of AIDS in those who are still in the early stages of HIV infection. Some other AIDS drugs, such as dideoxyinosine (DDI), have a similar mechanism of action. Newer drugs target and inactivate the HIV protease. Because of the high error rate of HIV reverse transcriptase and the resulting rapid evolution of HIV, the most effective treatments of HIV infection use a combination of drugs directed at both the protease and the reverse transcriptase.</p>

In addition to their self-splicing activities, they encode DNA endonucleases that promote their movement. During genetic exchanges between cells of the same species, or when DNA is introduced into a cell by parasites or by other means, these endonucleases promote insertion of the intron into an identical site in another DNA copy of a homologous gene that does not contain the intron, in a process termed <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_eM9PqM6Kdl">homing</dfn> (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_6O8WSNdtM1"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dp3zMK0YhZ" id="dav_9781319322342_dcmuC5WAMS">Fig. 26-34</a></strong>). Whereas group I intron homing is DNA-based, group II intron homing occurs through an RNA intermediate. The endonucleases of the group II introns have associated reverse transcriptase activity. The proteins can form complexes with the intron RNAs themselves, after the introns are spliced from the primary transcripts. Because the homing process involves insertion of the RNA intron into DNA and reverse transcription of the intron, the movement of these introns has been called retrohoming. Over time, every copy of a particular gene in a population may acquire the intron. <span aria-label="993" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page993" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Much more rarely, the intron may insert itself into a new location in an unrelated gene. If this event does not kill the host cell, it can lead to the evolution and distribution of an intron in a new location.

This yields horizontal D N A that has been cut with two paired shorter strands on the let and two paired longer strands on the right. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved arrow showing the addition of D N A labeled gene italicized X end italics, allele italicized a end italics with intron. This is a set of two horizontal strands that are blue at the edges. Each contains a red central region that is gray on each side. An arrow pointing downward is labeled double-strand break repair. This yields two double stranded pieces of D N A. Each is blue at the edges with a red center piece with gray pieces to its left and right. The top double stranded piece is labeled italicized a end italics with intron. The bottom double stranded piece is labeled italicized b end italics with intron. Part c is labeled retrohoming. Two lines representing double stranded D N A are labeled D N A for gene italicized Y end italics, allele italicized a end italics, donor. The lines are blue at the edges. Each contains a red central region with gray pieces to each side. This central region is labeled group Roman numeral 2 intron. An arrow pointing downward is labeled transcription. A second arrow pointing downward is labeled splicing. This yields a spliced intro, shown as a horizontal bar with yellow on the left, red in the center, and yellow to the right. An arrow labeled translation points right to show a red structure resembling two triangles attached by their points. This is labeled endonuclease / reverse transcriptase. An arrow pointing downward is labeled reverse splicing. A curved line shows the addition of D N A for gene italicized Y end italics, allele italicized b end italics, recipient. This is shown as two horizontal blue lines. A red structure resembling two triangles attached by their points is shown by the arrow and is labeled blue highlighted endonuclease. This yields two blue horizontal strands of D N A that have changed. The bottom strand has a break near the center. The top strand has a loop above the broken region of the bottom strand. This loop has yellow sides and a red top. An arrow points down accompanied by a red structure resembling two triangles attached by their points labeled blue highlighted reverse transcriptase. This yields double stranded D N A with two different strands. Both strands are blue on the ends with a red piece in the center. The top piece has yellow regions to the left and right of the red center. The bottom piece has gray regions to the left and right of the red center. An arrow pointing downward is labeled R N A replaced by D N A, ligation. This yields two strands that are blue on the ends with red centers that both have gray regions to the left and right of the red center.

The sequence is T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G and it is labeled T G primer on the left side. It enters the primer midway through the last sequence of four G nucleotides. The short complementary strand begins at 3 prime beneath the top strand. Its sequence is A A C C C C t prime. Within telomerase, there is a curved green R N A that has its 3 prime end at the bottom center, curves up to the left, runs horizontally across the top, and then curves back down to end at the 5 prime end next to the 3 prime end in the bottom center. The horizontal top piece has the sequence A A C C C C A A C. The left-hand A A C are aligned with the last three bases of the D N A strand above, T T G. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of d G T P, d T T P and another arrow branches off to show the loss of P P subscript i end subscript. This yields a similar structure in which bases have been added so the top D N A strand is now aligned with the entire sequence at the top of the green R N A. T T G G G G T T G at the right end of the D N A is paired with A A C C C C A A C in the R N A. An arrow points downward accompanied by text in a gray box reading, telomerase translocates. This yields a similar structure in which telomerase has moved to the right, so now only the terminal T T G of the D N A strand are paired with the left-hand A A C of the R N A and there is no D N A above the rest of the horizontal piece of R N A. An arrow points down accompanied by a curved line showing the addition of d G T P, d T T P and another arrow branches off to show the loss of P P subscript i end subscript. This yields a similar structure in which bases have been added so that the top D N A strand now is paired with the entire horizontal portion of the R N A piece again. An arrow points down accompanied by text in two gray boxes, one on each side of the arrow. The left-hand box reads, Telomerase dissociates. R N A primase synthesizes an R N A primer at the end of the new telomere strand. The right-hand box reads, D N A polymerase fills in the intervening gap; D N A ligase seals the final nick. This yields the same top blue strand with the sequence 5 prime T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G G G G T T G 3 prime. The bottom strand has the same blue portion on the left, which is 3 prime A A C C C C. It now has an orange portion to the right that reads, A A C C C C A A C C C C A A C C C C A A C C C C A A C C C. The right end is a green box labeled R N A primer that ends at the 5 prime end. An arrow points down accompanied by a gray box containing text reading, The R N A primer is removed by an R N ase. This yields a similar structure in which the green R N A primer has been removed. An arrow points down accompanied by a gray box containing text reading, The single-stranded part of the telomere end is protected by telomere-binding proteins. This shows the same molecule but there are four blue spheres evenly spaced behind is labeled telomere duplex D N A-binding proteins. To the right, a yellow rectangle with a cutout at its upper right corner labeled T R F 1 fits against a similar tab rectangle with a cutout at its lower left corner labeled T R F 2. Part b shows two blue strands of D N A that run horizontally, then open to form a bubble with T R F 1 and T R F 2 on its bottom center. T R F 1 is a light yellow rectangle with a cutout at the upper right and T R F 2 is a similar tan rectangle with a cutout at the lower left, so they fit together. The two strands come together on the other side of this bubble and loop around to form a circle that ends just above the upper left of the bubble. There are eight blue circles representing telomere duplex D N A-binding proteins along the length of the circle. The top strand, which is the inner strand of the circle, is labeled T G strand. The bottom strand, which is the outer strand of the circle, is labeled C A strand.</p>

A similar link between telomere length and cell senescence (cessation of cell division) has been observed in humans. In germ-line cells, which contain telomerase activity, telomere lengths are maintained; in somatic cells, which lack telomerase, they are not. There is a linear, inverse relationship between the length of telomeres in cultured fibroblasts and the age of the individual from whom the fibroblasts were taken: telomeres in human somatic cells gradually shorten as an individual ages. If the telomerase reverse transcriptase is introduced into human somatic cells in vitro, telomerase activity is restored and the cellular life span increases markedly.</p>

Those found in the genomes of eukaryotes generally play a role in the metabolism of another class of small RNAs, called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which participate in gene regulation (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch28_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_u3IxJMHSEv" id="dav_9781319322342_wl62loJ3ng">Chapter 28</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_riCvcW7ANI">Even though viral RNA replication and reverse transcription, retrohoming, and telomere synthesis represent a diverse array of biological processes, the polymerases involved in each pathway bear remarkable similarities in structure (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_BSvTltjqyO"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_A3RHfppjb2" id="dav_9781319322342_UeOG8s2p2T">Fig. 26-36</a></strong>). In all cases, palm and finger domains are used to grip the duplexed template and primer nucleic acids within the active site. Amazingly, the group II intron retrohoming reverse transcriptase is structurally most closely related to a protein component of the spliceosome that helps scaffold its RNA active site. In addition to identical splicing chemistry and active site features (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch26_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_RV0pZOh1Wy" id="dav_9781319322342_8AoXaoBGDH">Fig. 26-17</a>), this provides further evidence that the spliceosome evolved from a group II intron–like ancestor.</p>

This protein fold can be found in protein factors involved in (a) group II intron retrohoming, (b) spliceosome-catalyzed pre-mRNA splicing, (c) telomere synthesis, (d) HIV reverse transcription, and (e) hepatitis C viral genome replication. The retrohoming reverse transcriptase of group II introns is most structurally related to the reverse transcriptase structure present in the spliceosome, supporting their close evolutionary relationship. <span class="attribution" id="dav_9781319322342_pX4dhK377m">[Information from C.

It has two red helices curving up on the left two brown beta strands with a loop connecting them near the center labeled finger, a large green section of helices connected by strands with a few beta strands from the lower right to top center with the very top labeled palm, and two blue helices just to the right of the red helices at the far left with the right-hand blue helix overlapping the top of a green helix. The N terminus is at the upper left at the end of a red strand and the C terminus is at the lower right at the end of the green strand. Part b is labeled nuclear pre-m R N A splicing. It is very similar but there is a brown helix at the upper left, there are two small blue helices across the top and the N terminus is at the end of a blue strand in the top center, the green portion has two diagonal helices on the left and then a thicker region of helices and beta strands on the right, and the finger is very small. Part c is labeled telomere extension. It is similar to part b except that there are no red helices, there is vertical light blue helix on the left center with the N terminus at the bottom, to beta sheets extending to the right center form a conspicuous finger, and the green portion has fewer parts and is less substantial. Part d is labeled viral reverse transcription and is similar to part c except that the finger is much less substantial and consists of a thready loop at the bottom center, although it has some strands to the left accompanied by additional coils and strands at the left center. There are no red or purple helices. Part e is labeled viral replication. It resembles part a with the addition of more purple helices, more substantial brown beta sheets around the finger, and a light blue almost vertical helix at the bottom left center that is relatively short.</p>
