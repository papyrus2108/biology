<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_HAdj4WR4r0">Cells can obtain fatty acid fuels from four sources: fats consumed in the diet, fats stored in cells as lipid droplets, fats synthesized in one organ for export to another, and fats obtained by autophagy (which degrades the cell’s own organelles). Some species use all four sources under various circumstances; others use one or two. Vertebrates, for example, obtain fats in the diet; mobilize fats stored in specialized tissue (adipose tissue, consisting of cells called adipocytes); and, in the liver, convert excess dietary carbohydrates to fats for export to other tissues. During starvation, they can recycle lipids by autophagy. On average, 40% or more of the daily energy requirement of humans in highly industrialized countries is supplied by dietary triacylglycerols. Triacylglycerols provide more than half the energy requirements of some organs, particularly the liver, heart, and resting skeletal muscle. Stored triacylglycerols are virtually the sole source of energy in hibernating animals and migrating birds. Vascular plants mobilize fats stored in seeds during germination, but do not otherwise depend on fats for energy.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_wzdcWsP1CS">In vertebrates, before ingested triacylglycerols can be absorbed through the intestinal wall they must be converted from insoluble macroscopic fat particles to finely dispersed microscopic micelles.

An arrow points into the mouth and down to the esophagus, which is shown leading to the curved stomach. At the narrow left end of the stomach, where it meets the intestine, the green gallbladder is shown with a curved piece that wraps down below. An arrow points down and to the right, further into a close-up of the small intestine. Step 1: Bile salts emulsify dietary fats in the small intestine, forming mixed micelles. The top and front of the small intestine are cut away to show molecules inside. Most have a blue spherical head with a single yellow tail extending down. Two have blue oval heads with three tails extending down. The lining of the intestine is labeled intestinal mucosa. Step 2: Intestinal lipases degrade triacylglycerols. Step 3: Fatty acids and other breakdown products are taken up by the intestinal mucosa and converted into triacylglycerols. Arrows come together from the main series of arrows pointing through the length of the intestine, from the molecules in the intestine to a single molecule with a blue oval head and three tails, and from a green crescent labeled A p o C – Roman numeral 2. Step 4: Triacylglycerols are incorporated, with cholesterol and apolipoproteins, into chylomicrons. The three arrows previously described come together, and a single arrow points to a blue sphere labeled chylomicron that contains four molecules that each have a blue oval with three yellow threads handing down. A green A p o C – Roman numeral 2 crescent is against the upper right side. Step 5: Chylomicrons move through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to tissues. An arrow points from the chylomicron into the open end of a capillary, where many molecules with blue heads and yellow tails are visible. Step 6: Lipoprotein lipase, activated by apo C – Roman numeral 2 in the capillary, converts triacylglycerols to fatty acids and monoacylglycerols. A purple oblong labeled lipoprotein lipase is visible inside the capillary. Step 7: Fatty acids enter cells. An arrow runs along the length of the capillary and then bends to pass out of the capillary, where five molecules with blue heads and yellow tails are visible within a cell with a visible nucleus. Text reads, myocyte or adipocyte. Step 8: Fatty acids are oxidized as fuel or reesterified for storage. An arrow pointing from these five molecules splits. One half points to a single molecule with a blue oval head and three yellow tails. Accompanying text reads, storage. The other arrow bends into the next cell and splits with one arrow pointing to C O 2 and the other pointing to an orange oval labeled A T P.</p>

A horizontal plasma membrane runs across the top of each cell and along the sides of the blood vessel. Step 1: At the top center of the adipocyte, a rectangular receptor is visible embedded in the membrane with a concavity on its outer surface that contains a sphere labeled glucagon. An arrow points right from the bottom of the receptor to a sphere labeled G subscript s, from which an arrow points to the bottom of a sphere labeled adenylyl cyclase that is embedded in the membrane. Step 2: A curved arrow shows that A T P approaches adenylyl cyclase and c A M P leaves. A dashed vertical arrow points down from c A M P to a green circle around a green triangle above the word P K A. Step 3: A sphere labeled hormone-sensitive lipase has an arrow that curves above the number 3, beneath P K A, to another oval labeled H S L that has a green circle labeled P bond to its top side. A dashed arrow points from H S L to a similar H S L in the wall of a lipid droplet. Step 4: An arrow extends from P K A to an arrow at the upper right side of the lipid droplet. Above and to the left of the arrow, there is a series of two perilipin ovals that each have a green sphere above labeled C G I – 58. To the right of the arrow, three are five perilipin ovals oriented vertically instead of horizontally in the membrane, each with a circle labeled P attached to the side outside of the lipid droplet. Step 5: A dashed line labeled 5 points to a similar green sphere without an accompanying perilipin. A small oval across the lipid droplet membrane is labeled A T G L at its upper right side contacts the sphere labeled C G I – 58 without perilipin. A triacylglycerol, shown as a oval with three threads hanging down, has a curved arrow up to A T G L that curves down in step 6 to produce a diacylglycerol, shown as an oval with two threads hanging down, and a single oval with one thread hanging down, representing a fatty acid. In step 7, a curved arrow points from these molecules to H S L in the membrane of the lipid droplet, then bends back to show a fatty acid next to a monoacylglycerol, shown as an oval with a single thread hanging down. Step 8: A curved arrow points from monoacylglycerol to an oval labeled M G L in the membrane of the lipid droplet and then points away to a fatty acid next to a single blue labeled glycerol. Arrows point from the diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, fatty acids, and glycerol across the membrane of the lipid droplet to point to three fatty acids in the adipocyte. Step 9: An arrow points from the three fatty acids to a fatty acid enclosed in an oval of serum albumin within the blood. An empty oval of serum albumin is below with an arrow pointing up to the one containing a fatty acid. Another arrow points up to a second albumin containing a fatty acid, above which another arrow points to an empty oval of albumin. Step 10: The upper fatty acid in an oval of serum albumin has an arrow pointing to the right through a white fatty acid transporter in the membrane of the myocyte. The fatty acid transporter is narrow in the center and wider above and below. This produces a fatty acid molecule within the myocyte. Step 11: An arrow pointing down is labeled Greek letter beta oxidation, citric acid cycle, respiratory chain. The arrow splits to produce A T P and C O 2.</p>

Coenzyme A in the mitochondrial matrix is largely used in oxidative degradation of pyruvate, fatty acids, and some amino acids, whereas cytosolic coenzyme A is used in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_YT5BOF1bEv" id="dav_9781319322342_E5OcN57fZd">Fig. 21-10</a>). Fatty acyl–CoA in the cytosolic pool can be used there for membrane lipid synthesis or can be moved into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation and ATP production. Conversion to the carnitine ester commits the fatty acyl moiety to the oxidative fate. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_Om0AcbkGCN" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_PG01c.png"/> The carnitine-mediated entry process is the rate-limiting step for oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria and, as discussed later, is a control point. Carnitine acyltransferase 1 is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_N41JdgJePo" id="dav_9781319322342_0AZZJjtCaj">Fig. 21-1</a>). This inhibition prevents the simultaneous synthesis and degradation of fatty acids, a wasteful futile cycle.</p>

They are combined with specific apolipoproteins for passage through the blood and lymph to adipose tissue, where they are stored as lipid droplets.</li>

The released fatty acids bind to serum albumin and are carried in the blood to the heart, skeletal muscle, and other tissues that use fatty acids for fuel.</li>

Fatty acyl–CoA that is to be oxidized enters mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle, which is a major control point. Malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, inhibits carnitine acyltransferase 1, assuring that fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis do not occur simultaneously.</li>
