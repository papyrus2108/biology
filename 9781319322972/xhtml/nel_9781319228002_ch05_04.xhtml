<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_UYNMfpufnW">Organisms move. Cells move. Organelles and macromolecules within cells move. Most of these movements arise from the activity of a fascinating class of protein-based molecular motors. Fueled by chemical energy, usually derived from ATP, large aggregates of motor proteins undergo cyclic conformational changes that accumulate into a unified, directional force — the tiny force that pulls apart chromosomes in a dividing cell, and the immense force that levers a pouncing, quarter-ton jungle cat into the air.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_LJxJwKemTS">The interactions among motor proteins, as you might predict, feature complementary arrangements of ionic, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic groups at protein binding sites. In motor proteins, however, the resulting interactions achieve exceptionally high levels of spatial and temporal organization.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_2Kvx7PJI34">Motor proteins underlie the migration of organelles along microtubules, the motion of eukaryotic and bacterial flagella, and the movement of some proteins along DNA. Here, we focus on the well-studied example of the contractile proteins of vertebrate skeletal muscle as a paradigm for how proteins translate chemical energy into motion.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_gmMSZMshoj">The contractile force of muscle is generated by the interaction of two proteins, myosin and actin. These proteins are arranged in filaments that undergo transient interactions and slide past each other to bring about contraction. Together, actin and myosin make up more than 80% of the protein mass of muscle.</p>

The fibers are made up of many myofibrils (only six are shown here for simplicity) surrounded by the membranous sarcoplasmic reticulum. The organization of thick and thin filaments in a myofibril gives it a striated appearance. When muscle contracts, the I bands narrow and the Z disks move closer together, as seen in electron micrographs of (b) relaxed muscle and (c) contracted muscle.

Muscle contraction occurs by the sliding of the thick and thin filaments past each other so that the Z disks in neighboring I bands draw closer together.

A close-up of the muscle shows a bundle of muscle fibers as a tubular structure made up of smaller tubular structures called muscle fibers that are visible in cross-section at the end. A close-up of a muscle fiber shows many strands labeled capillaries and several oval nuclei along its outside. It has a banded pattern. The outer covering is removed near the end and a network of yellow tubular structures labeled sarcoplasmic reticulum is visible. At the end of this structure, a cross-sectional view shows that it contains bundles that each contain smaller tubular structures. One of these is labeled myofibril and is shown in close-up as a banded tubular structure. A single region labeled sarcomere extends from a thin vertical line labeled Z disk on one end to a similar Z-disk on the other side. In the middle of these, another line is labeled M line. There is a darker A band around the M line. On either side of the A band, there is a lighter region called an I band that extends to the Z disk and continues past the Z disk to the A band of the next sarcomere. Part b shows two strips of micrograph showing relaxed and contracted sarcomeres. The top strip, relaxed, shows a sarcomere in the center with a vertical Z disk on each end. A vertical M line is in the middle between them and has narrow light vertical lines on either side that are each adjacent to darker vertical bars. Thick dark bars are adjacent to these vertical bars, and the entire central region is labeled A band. Adjacent to the A band, there is a lighter vertical bar on each side that extends to a Z disk, then there is an adjacent lighter vertical bar on the far side of the Z disk. This lighter region is labeled I band. The bottom strip, contracted, shows the M line in the same place. The A band is the same length but is more uniform in color with just a thin pale vertical line on each side of the M line. The I band has become much smaller on each side of the Z disk. The Z disks are each about 1.8 micrometers closer to the M line. The length of each sarcomere is shown as about 16 micrometers. Part c shows illustrations of relaxed and contracted sarcomeres. The relaxed sarcomere has a roughly hexagonal cross-section on each end. These hexagons are labeled Z disk and each has 6 thin filaments attached with one at each vertex and extending toward the center of the sarcomere. Each thin filament consists of two intertwined chains of spheres. A thick filament is visible in the middle as many strands joined together. There is space between each end of the thick filament and the Z disk on that end. Except in the central region where there is no overlap with the thin filament, the thick filament has small hook-like structures extending from the Z disk and curving back toward the center. The region extending the length of the thick filament is labeled A band. The region where there is thin filament but no thick filament is labeled I band. In the contracted illustration, there is more overlap between the thin and thick filaments, only a small piece of thick filament that does not overlap with the thin filament, and only a short region where the thin filament does not overlap with the thick filament. The A band is the same length but the I band is shorter.</p>

When ATP is not bound to myosin, a face on the myosin head group binds tightly to actin (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_niCXaraqoe"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch05_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_CirDX0KJJ5" id="dav_9781319322342_w8R0FB4Irh">Fig. 5-29</a></strong>). When ATP binds to myosin and is hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate, a coordinated and cyclic series of conformational changes occurs in which myosin releases the F-actin subunit and binds another subunit farther along the thin filament.</p>

The actin filament consists of two intertwined chains of spheres, one of which is in contact with the base of the myosin head. The sphere immediately to the right of the contacted sphere is highlighted. Step 1: Text reads, A T P binds to myosin head, causing dissociation from actin. A T P is shown being added. The next figure is similar except that an arrow points upward next to the myosin head, the myosin head has A T P attached, and there is a small space between the myosin head and actin. Step 2: As tightly bound A T P is hydrolyzed, a conformational change occurs. A D P and P I remain associated with the myosin head. The figure is similar except that the myosin head with A D P and P i is shown bending so that its base moves to the right. Step 3: Myosin head attaches to actin filament, causing release of P i. P i is shown leaving. The figure is similar except that the myosin head has moved down and is now bound to the highlighted actin sphere immediately to the right of the sphere to which it was previously bound. Step 4: P i release triggers a power stroke, a conformational change in the myosin head that moves actin and myosin filaments relative to one another. A D P is released in the process. A D P is shown leaving. The myosin head is shown bending as it moves to the left to move the actin filament to the left. An arrow shows that this produces the original structure shown before step 1 so that the process can continue.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_bOq9PViWpi">Because there are many myosin heads in a thick filament, at any given moment some (probably 1% to 3%) are bound to thin filaments. This prevents thick filaments from slipping backward when an individual myosin head releases the actin subunit to which it was bound. The thick filament thus actively slides forward past the adjacent thin filaments. This process, coordinated among the many sarcomeres in a muscle fiber, brings about muscle contraction.</p>
