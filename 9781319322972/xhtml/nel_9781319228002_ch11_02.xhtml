<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_GRSMFNmtbW">We begin our discussion of biological membranes by looking at the stable bilayer structures formed spontaneously by phospholipids in water. In biological membranes we see this basic lipid bilayer combined with a wide array of membrane proteins specialized for one of the many roles that membranes play in cells. Each intracellular compartment has membranes with specific protein and lipid content, uniquely disposed across the two leaflets of the bilayer. The intracellular membranes together make up a dynamic endomembrane system that synthesizes and distributes membrane components to create functionally specialized cell compartments. Depending on its function, a protein may form one or several transmembrane segments, or it may adhere to the membrane bilayer through lipids attached to the protein, or it may alternate between membrane-associated and free forms.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_MPIJkfIQlE">Glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols are virtually insoluble in water. Recall that glycerophospholipids contain two long-chain fatty acids (which are <span aria-label="368" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" role="doc-pagebreak"/>hydrophobic) and a head group consisting of glycerol and one of several polar or charged substituents such as phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dJuWkwV1uo" id="dav_9781319322342_5wtaeSfV6P">Fig. 10-8</a>). Sphingolipids are constructed from a long-chain alkyl amine (sphingosine), a saturated long-chain fatty acid, and a polar head group that may be as simple as phosphocholine or may be a complex oligosaccharide (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_hwcpDXQCGH" id="dav_9781319322342_dALYIFeOkM">Fig. 10-11</a>). Sterols (cholesterol in animal membranes) have a very nonpolar steroid nucleus of four fused rings, and a polar hydroxyl group at one end of the ring system (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch10_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Wk055uyHDz" id="dav_9781319322342_ospYAAe2NA">Fig. 10-15</a>). Each type of membrane lipid has its particular effect on membrane structure and function. When mixed with water, these lipids spontaneously form microscopic lipid aggregates, clustering together, with their hydrophobic moieties in contact with each other and their hydrophilic groups in contact with the surrounding water. The clustering reduces the amount of hydrophobic surface exposed to water. This minimizes the number of molecules in the shell of ordered water at the lipid-water interface (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch02_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_e0tqw4Dm8Y" id="dav_9781319322342_hTAdgSNjgf">Fig. 2-7</a>), resulting in an increase in entropy. This hydrophobic effect provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation and maintenance of these clusters of lipid molecules. The term <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_PA6cKMEkBe">hydrophobic interactions</dfn> is sometimes used to describe the clustering of hydrophobic molecular surfaces in an aqueous environment, but the molecules are not interacting chemically; they are simply finding the lowest-energy environment by reducing the hydrophobic, or nonpolar, surface area exposed to water.</p>

The horizontal axis ranges from negative 40 to positive 40, labeled in increments of 10. Dashed vertical lines run from the bottom horizontal axis to the top horizontal axis at negative 12 and positive 14. The region from negative 40 to negative 22 is blue, the region from negative 22 to positive 22 is yellow with a white vertical region at 0, and the region from 22 to 40 is blue. The word interface is immediately to the left of the left-hand vertical dashed line and to the right of the right-hand vertical dashed line. In both cases, the word interface is above the place where the blue and yellow regions meet. The region between the vertical dashed lines is labeled hydrocarbon core. Above the graph, space-filling models of two phospholipids are shown. The left-hand phospholipid has purple atoms extending into the left-hand blue region, then red atoms above the yellow region from negative 20 to negative 15, then red atoms along the outside as two long yellow tails, which begin at negative 15. The long yellow tails extend to 0 on the right. The right-hand phospholipid has purple atoms extending into the right-hand blue region, then red atoms above the yellow region from 20 to 15, then red atoms along the outside as two long yellow tails begin at 15. The long yellow tails extend to 0 on the left. Multiple curves are shown on the graph. Water has a curve that begins at negative 34, peaks at about one-quarter of the vertical axis at negative 22, then symmetrically declines to end behind other curves on its right side. It has a similar curve on the right that begins at 34, peaks at one-quarter of the vertical axis at 22, and then symmetrically declines to end behind other curves on its left side. Choline has a right-hand curve that begins at negative 30, peaks at about one-sixteenth of the height of the vertical axis at negative 22, and then decreases symmetrically to end at negative 14 and a left-hand curve that begins at 14, peaks at about one-sixteenth of the height of the vertical axis at 22, and then decreases symmetrically to end at 22. Phosphate has a curve that appears behind choline to peak slightly above it at negative 20 before decreasing to end at negative 14 and a similar curve that begins at 14, increases to a peak slightly above choline at 20, and then disappears behind choline. Glycerol has a curve that appears behind phosphate to peak slightly higher than phosphate at negative 19 before decreasing to disappear behind phosphate at negative 15 and a similar curve that appears behind phosphate at 15, increases to a peak slightly higher than phosphate at 19, and then begins to decrease as it disappears behind phosphate. Carbonyls has a peak that emerges behind glycerol at negative 18, peaks at negative 17 at midway between the vertical heights of phosphate and water, and then declines to end at negative 10 and a similar curve that appears at 10, reaches a height at 17 midway between the vertical heights of phosphate and water, and then declines to go behind glycerol at 18. A peak labeled C H 2 with C double bonded to C and further bonded on each side emerges behind phosphate at negative 19.5, increases to near the top of the vertical axis at negative 10, decreases to plateau at about three-quarters of the height of the vertical axis at negative 8 to negative 4, then decreases again from negative 4 to 0 at just above the height of the curve for water at about one-quarter of the height of the vertical axis, from which it rises to about three-quarters of the height of the vertical axis at 4, plateaus until 8, then rises to peak near the top of the vertical axis at 10 before decreasing to disappear behind phosphate at 19.5. A peak labeled C H 3 begins at negative 5, rises to peak just above the C H 2 inflection point at 0, then decreases to end at 5. All data are approximate.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_NnCV2yMjLC">Membranes are not merely passive barriers. They are flexible, self-repairing, and selectively permeable. Their flexibility permits the shape changes that accompany cell growth and movement (such as amoeboid movement). With their ability to break and reseal, two membranes can fuse, as in exocytosis, or a single membrane-enclosed compartment can undergo fission to yield two sealed compartments, as in endocytosis or cell division, without creating gross leaks through cellular surfaces. Their selective permeability allows them to serve as molecular gatekeepers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9M0AVRCz2C">These membrane functions are accomplished primarily by a broad array of proteins and enzymes in and on membranes. At the cell surface, transporters move specific organic solutes and inorganic ions across the membrane; receptors sense extracellular signals and trigger molecular changes in the cell; ion channels mediate electrical signaling between cells; and adhesion molecules hold neighboring cells together. The relative proportions of protein and lipid vary with the type of membrane, reflecting the diversity of biological roles. For example, certain neurons have a myelin sheath — an extended plasma membrane that wraps around the cell many times and acts as a passive electrical insulator. The myelin sheath consists primarily of lipids (good insulators). In contrast, the plasma membranes of bacteria and the membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the sites of many enzyme-catalyzed processes, contain more protein than lipid (in mass per total mass).</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_2tiH1toZom">Within the cell, membranes organize cellular processes such as the synthesis of lipids and certain proteins and the energy transductions that produce ATP in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Proteins associated with membranes are essentially confined to two-dimensional space, where intermolecular collisions of membrane proteins and lipids are far more probable than in the three-dimensional cytoplasm, so the efficiency of enzyme-catalyzed processes organized within membranes can be vastly increased.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_H4rVXS8xmP">Determination of the location of a membrane protein relative to the bilayer — that is, its topology — is generally much more difficult than determining its amino acid sequence, either directly or by gene sequencing. The amino acid sequences of many thousands of membrane proteins are known, but fewer three-dimensional structures have been established by x-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The presence of unbroken sequences of more than 20 hydrophobic residues in a membrane protein is commonly taken as evidence that these sequences traverse the lipid bilayer, acting as hydrophobic anchors or forming transmembrane channels. All known integral proteins have at least one such sequence. Application of this logic to entire genomic sequences leads to the conclusion that in many organisms, 20% to 30% of all proteins are integral proteins.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_I6113CXYXn">What can we predict about the secondary structure of the membrane-spanning portions of integral proteins?

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_w66fqEvYXn">Several simple methods of analyzing amino acid sequences yield reasonably accurate predictions of secondary structure for transmembrane proteins. The relative polarity of each amino acid has been determined experimentally by measuring the free-energy change accompanying the movement of that amino acid side chain from a hydrophobic environment into water. This free energy of transfer, which can be expressed as a <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_ftDKumcBQJ"><a class="glossref" epub:type="glossref" href="nel_9781319228002_EM_glossary.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_LeytYskFCR" id="dav_9781319322342_0BdglUjfqr" role="doc-glossref">hydropathy index</a></dfn> (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Quh2XjfsFy" id="dav_9781319322342_sg0wfopP9G">Table 3-1</a>), ranges from highly exergonic for charged or polar residues to highly endergonic for amino acids with aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon side chains. The overall hydropathy index (hydrophobicity) of a sequence of amino acids is estimated by summing the free energies of transfer for the residues in the sequence. To scan a polypeptide sequence for potential membrane-spanning segments, an investigator calculates the hydropathy index for successive segments (called windows) of a given size, from 7 to 20 residues. For a window of seven residues, for example, the average indices for residues 1 to 7, 2 to 8, 3 to 9, and so on, are plotted as in <strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_YNxxCIeIAr"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch11_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_fbeyWMAVXl" id="dav_9781319322342_4fgE8utqt6">Figure 11-13</a></strong> (plotted for the middle residue in each window — residue 4 for residues 1 to 7, for example). A region with more than 20 residues of high hydropathy index is presumed to be a transmembrane segment.

A large piece extends above the membrane that is about equally blue and gray except for yellow spheres at the upper left corner. Phosphoporin uppercase E has a roughly rectangular shape and is mostly gray within the hydrophobic region with some blue spheres visible and with clumps of yellow spheres along the top and bottom just within the phosphate layers. Below the membrane, the molecule is mostly blue and gray. Above the membrane, the molecule is about equally blue and gray.</p>

The attached lipid provides a hydrophobic anchor that inserts into the lipid bilayer and holds the protein at the membrane surface. The strength of the hydrophobic interaction between a bilayer and a single hydrocarbon chain linked to a protein is barely enough to anchor the protein securely, but many proteins have more than one attached lipid moiety. Furthermore, other interactions, such as ionic attractions between positively charged Lys residues in the protein and negatively charged lipid head groups, can add to the anchoring effect of a covalently bound lipid.

The carboxyl-terminal Cys residue is invariably methylated. Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are derivatives of phosphatidylinositol in which the inositol bears a short oligosaccharide covalently joined to the carboxyl-terminal residue of a protein through phosphoethanolamine. GPI-anchored proteins are always on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Farnesylated and palmitoylated membrane proteins are found on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and myristoylated proteins have domains both inside and outside the plasma membrane. For some lipid-linked proteins, the lipid attachment process is reversible, so the protein is amphitropic: membrane-bound when lipid-linked, soluble when not.</p>
