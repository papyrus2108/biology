During rapid growth, synthesis of new membranes requires the production of membrane phospholipids; when an organism has a plentiful food supply but is not actively growing, it shunts most of its fatty acids into storage fats. Both pathways begin at the same point: the formation of fatty acyl esters of glycerol. In this section we examine the route to triacylglycerols and its regulation, and the production of glycerol 3-phosphate in the process of glyceroneogenesis.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_sGUj5sf5XM">Animals can synthesize and store large quantities of triacylglycerols, to be used later as fuel (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch17_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_F5SnVrtvH6" id="dav_9781319322342_Eg1YePwYnb">Box 17-1</a>). Humans can store only a few hundred grams of glycogen in liver and muscle, barely enough to supply the body’s energy needs for 12 hours. However, a 70 kg human stores about 15 kg of triacylglycerol in its tissues, enough to support basal energy needs for as long as 12 weeks (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_mJZ2H0imcE" id="dav_9781319322342_o8QLNdYNfZ">Table 23-5</a>). Triacylglycerols have the highest energy content of all stored nutrients — more than 38 kJ/g. Whenever carbohydrate is ingested in excess of the organism’s capacity to store glycogen, the excess is converted to triacylglycerols and stored in adipose tissue. Plants also manufacture triacylglycerols as an energy-rich fuel, mainly stored in fruits, nuts, and seeds.</p>

Biosynthesis and degradation of triacylglycerols are regulated to meet the metabolic requirements of the moment. The rate of triacylglycerol biosynthesis is profoundly altered by the action of several hormones. Insulin, for example, promotes the conversion of carbohydrate to triacylglycerols (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_nkTgafIrpA"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_KRbo0FVtDw" id="dav_9781319322342_n8qjfClz6Q">Fig. 21-19</a></strong>).

Simultaneously, these hormonal signals decrease the rate of glycolysis and increase the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver (providing glucose for the brain, as further elaborated in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch23_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_CGFXSBSGw7" id="dav_9781319322342_PDyaLxkRDe">Chapter 23</a>). The released fatty acid is taken up by several tissues, including muscle, where it is oxidized to provide energy. Much of the fatty acid taken up by liver is not oxidized but is recycled to triacylglycerol and returned to adipose tissue.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_sX00tWlzlb">The function of the apparently futile triacylglycerol cycle is not well understood, but as we learn more about how the cycle is sustained via metabolism in two separate organs and is coordinately regulated, some possibilities emerge. For example, the excess capacity in the triacylglycerol cycle — the fatty acid that is eventually reconverted to triacylglycerol rather than oxidized as fuel — could represent an energy reserve in the bloodstream during fasting, one that could be more rapidly mobilized in a “fight or flight” emergency than stored triacylglycerol could be.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_kb4Dcn455i">The constant recycling of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue even during starvation raises a second question: what is the source of the glycerol 3-phosphate required for this process? As noted above, glycolysis is suppressed under these conditions by the action of glucagon and epinephrine, so little DHAP is available. And glycerol released during lipolysis cannot be converted directly to glycerol 3-phosphate in adipose tissue, which lacks glycerol kinase (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch21_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_yvjWg8aPCr" id="dav_9781319322342_TOzFcL2fDp">Fig. 21-17</a>). So, how is sufficient glycerol 3-phosphate produced? The answer lies in the pathway of glyceroneogenesis, discovered in the 1960s by Lea Reshef, Richard Hanson, and John Ballard, and simultaneously by Eleazar Shafrir and his coworkers. The investigators were intrigued by the presence of two gluconeogenic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, in adipose tissue, where glucose is not synthesized. Yet, the importance of this pathway was not appreciated until decades later. Glyceroneogenesis is intimately linked to the triacylglycerol cycle and, in a larger sense, to the balance between fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_uZBC8tHpxR">Stimulation of glyceroneogenesis leads to an increase in the synthesis of triacylglycerol molecules in the liver and their release into the blood. At the same time, glucocorticoids suppress expression of the gene encoding PEP carboxykinase in adipose tissue. This results in a decrease in glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue; recycling of fatty acids declines as a result, and more free fatty acids are released into the blood. Thus, regulation of glyceroneogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue affects lipid metabolism in opposite ways: a lower rate of glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue leads to more fatty acid release (rather than recycling), whereas a higher rate in the liver leads to more synthesis and export of triacylglycerols. The net result is an increase in flux through the triacylglycerol cycle. When the glucocorticoids are no longer present, flux through the cycle declines as the expression of PEP carboxykinase increases in adipose tissue and decreases in the liver.</p>
