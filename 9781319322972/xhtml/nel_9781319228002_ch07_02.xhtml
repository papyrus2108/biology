<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_fl5z0KvKNf">The simplest of the carbohydrates, the monosaccharides, are either aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups; the six-carbon monosaccharides glucose and fructose have five hydroxyl groups. Many of the carbon atoms to which the hydroxyl groups are attached are chiral centers, which give rise to the many sugar stereoisomers found in nature. Stereoisomerism in sugars is biologically significant because the enzymes that act on sugars are strictly stereospecific, typically preferring one stereoisomer to another by three or more orders of magnitude, as reflected in <span class="math" id="dav_9781319322342_SeZn5pGPc4" tabindex="0"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="mathml alt text" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternative-representation"><img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" alt="upper K Subscript m" src="../images/MATH/nel_9781319228002_ch07_02EQ_0001.png"/></annotation-xml></semantics></math></span> values or binding constants.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_9RiMEbOYpS">We begin by describing the families of monosaccharides with backbones of three to seven carbons — their structure, their stereoisomeric forms, and the means of representing their three-dimensional structures on paper. We then discuss several chemical reactions of the carbonyl groups of monosaccharides. One such reaction, the addition of a hydroxyl group from within the same molecule, generates cyclic forms with four or more backbone carbons (the forms that predominate in aqueous solution). <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large" id="dav_9781319322342_r9MB2TB0gL" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_07_PG229a.png"/> This ring closure creates a new chiral center, adding further stereochemical complexity to this class of compounds. The nomenclature for unambiguously specifying the configuration about each carbon atom in a cyclic form and the means of representing these structures on paper are described in some detail; this information will be useful as we discuss the metabolism of monosaccharides in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_pt02_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Fn7qRGKUut" id="dav_9781319322342_6LeOA6OrIs">Part II</a>.

Sweetness is detected by protein receptors in the plasma membranes of cells in the taste buds on the surface of the tongue. In humans, two closely related genes (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_cOz5AIwra6">TAS1R2</i> and <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_KEaMnrR52p">TAS1R3</i>) encode sweet-taste receptors (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_p8vcqQU9Hv" id="dav_9781319322342_REqIGRbOfp">Fig. 1</a>). When a molecule with a compatible structure binds a sweet-taste receptor’s extracellular domain, it triggers a series of events in the cell (including activation of a GTP-binding protein; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_yNwwU4aUn3" id="dav_9781319322342_FVLJcyRomU">Fig. 12-20</a>) that generates an electrical signal to the brain that is interpreted as “sweet.”</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_4MUod0rqSR">A horizontal section of plasma membrane is shown. Its top and bottom edges are composed of chains of small white circles. Irregular threadlike formations extend from these toward the interior of the membrane, leaving a series of small gaps between those extending upward and those extending downward. On the left of the figure, two rectangular structures extend across the membrane with an open region of membrane between them. Beneath this open piece of membrane extends G T P-binding protein (inactive), which is indicated as a large vertical oval subunit, a piece curved around like a backward C, and a smaller oval part with a curved tail. All of these pieces join at the membrane and extend into the bottom half of the membrane. The rectangular structures extending across the membrane each contain parallel vertical lines joined together at the ends, made by folding a single linear structure. The end of the linear structure extends out of the bottom of each rectangle on the side farthest from the open center. At the opposite top side of each rectangular structure, the other end of each strand extends up to a structure that looks like two roughly triangular halves joined together by their vertices to form a narrower middle region. The double triangle structure on the left is labeled T A S 1 R 2 and the one on the right is labeled T A S 1 R 3. The receptors overlap at their bases and extend away from each other. A bent oval labeled brazzein is approaching the narrow region of the T A S 1 R 2 protein. On the other side of the narrow region, a hexagon labeled glucose, sucrose, fructose is approaching the narrow regions of both receptors. An arrow shows that alitame, neotame, aspartame, and sucralose can approach the same region as glucose. To the right of the figure, further along the section of plasma membrane, a similar structure is shown in which the G T P-binding protein is active. It only has the single large oval part; the other parts have left. Lines extend out from all sides of this oval part. T A S 1 R 2 and T A S 1 R 3 have come together to overlap at top and bottom with a small opening between them at the narrower region of each where the hexagon of glucose or a similar molecule is located.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_4tXhXRF2DK">During evolution, there has probably been selection for the ability to taste compounds found in foods containing important nutrients, such as the carbohydrates that are major fuels for most organisms. Most sugars, including sucrose, glucose, lactose, and fructose, taste sweet, but other classes of compounds also bind sweet-taste receptors. The amino acids glycine, alanine, and serine are mildly sweet and harmless; nitrobenzene and ethylene glycol have a strong sweet taste but are toxic. (See <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_6UpnKIn9uQ" id="dav_9781319322342_Ume511IRIh">Box 18-2</a> for a remarkable medical mystery involving ethylene glycol poisoning.) Several natural products are extraordinarily sweet. Stevioside, a sugar derivative isolated from the leaves of the stevia plant (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_2nELA0mzto">Stevia rebaudiana</i> Bertoni), is several hundred times sweeter than an equivalent amount of sucrose. The small protein brazzein (54 amino acids), isolated from berries of the Oubli vine (<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_SNVD03bTtJ">Pentadiplandra brazzeana</i> Baillon) in Gabon and Cameroon, is 17,000 times sweeter than sucrose on a molar basis. Presumably, the sweetness of the berries encourages their consumption by animals that then disperse the seeds so that new plants are established.</p>

N-acetylmuramic acid is similar to muramic acid, except that C 2 is bonded to N H that is further bonded to C that is double bonded to O and further bonded to C H 3. Greek letter beta D-galactosamine is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that it has C 2 bonded to red highlighted N H 2 below the ring. Greek letter beta D-mannosamine is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that it has C 2 bonded to red highlighted N H 2 above the ring.

Greek letter alpha L-rhamnose is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that C 3 is bonded to H above the ring and O H below the ring, C 4 is bonded to O H above the ring and H below the ring, and C 5 is bonded to H above the right and red highlighted C H 3 below the ring. Greek letter beta D-glucuronate is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that it has C 5 bonded to a red highlighted group above the ring with C that is double bonded to O and single bonded to O minus. D-gluconate is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that O in the ring is bonded to H instead of to C 1, meaning the ring is missing its top right side, and red highlighted C 1 is single bonded to red highlighted O minus above the ring and double bonded to red highlighted O below the partial ring. D-glucono Greek letter delta lactone is similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that O in the ring is red highlighted. This red O is connected to red highlighted C 1 by a red bond, and C 1 is connected by a red highlighted double bond to a red highlighted O. N-acetylneuraminic acid (a sialic acid) has a ring similar to Greek letter beta D-glucose, except that C 1 is bonded above to a red highlighted group of C double bonded to O and single bonded to O minus and below to O H, C 3 is bonded to H above the ring and O H below the ring, C 4 is bonded above the ring to a red highlighted group with N H bonded to C that is double bonded to O and bonded to C H 3 and to H below the ring, and C 5 is bonded to H above the ring and to red highlighted R below the ring. The red highlighted R is shown to be a red highlighted substituent with C bonded to O H on the right, H on the left, and C below that is bonded to O H on the right, H on the left, and C H 2 O H below.</p>

Sugar phosphates are relatively stable at neutral pH and bear a negative charge. One effect of sugar phosphorylation within cells is to trap the sugar inside the cell; most cells do not have plasma membrane transporters for phosphorylated sugars. Phosphorylation also activates sugars for subsequent chemical transformation. Several important phosphorylated derivatives of sugars are components of nucleotides (discussed in the next chapter).</p>

When the amount of glucose reaching the brain is too low, the consequences can be dire: lethargy, coma, permanent brain damage, and death. Complex hormonal mechanisms have evolved to ensure that the concentration of glucose in the blood remains high enough (about 5 m<span class="smallcap" id="dav_9781319322342_5SXylFzMoS">m</span>) to satisfy the brain’s needs — but not too high, because elevated blood glucose can also have serious physiological consequences.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_bXJTqWmvef">Individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus do not produce sufficient insulin, the hormone that normally serves to reduce blood glucose concentration. If the diabetes is untreated, blood glucose levels may rise to several-fold higher than normal. These high glucose levels are believed to be at least one cause of the serious long-term consequences of untreated diabetes — kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, blindness, and impaired wound healing — so one goal of therapy is to provide just enough insulin (by injection) to keep blood glucose levels near normal. To maintain the correct balance of exercise, diet, and insulin, individuals with diabetes must measure their blood glucose concentration several times a day, and adjust the amount of insulin injected appropriately.</p>

The rate of this process is proportional to the concentration of glucose, so the reaction can be used to estimate the average blood glucose level over weeks. The amount of glycated hemoglobin (GHB) present at any time reflects the average blood glucose concentration over the circulating lifetime of the erythrocyte (about 120 days), although the concentration in the two weeks before the test is the most important in setting the level of GHB.</p>

AGE are believed to be responsible for at least some of the pathology of diabetes. AGE can leave the erythrocyte and form covalent cross-links between proteins, interfering with normal protein function (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ccs86LrEK6" id="dav_9781319322342_YA2RM55pA5">Fig. 4</a>). The accumulation of relatively high concentrations of AGE in people with diabetes may, by cross-linking critical proteins, cause the damage to the kidneys, retinas, and cardiovascular system that characterizes the disease. Some AGE also can act through membrane receptors for AGE (RAGE), triggering intracellular responses that include activation of a transcription factor (NF-κB) and consequent changes in gene expression. This pathogenic process is a potential target for drug action.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_JjDfNs3AJf">Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. It is formed by plants but not by animals. In contrast to maltose and lactose, sucrose contains no free anomeric carbon atom; the anomeric carbons of both monosaccharide units are involved in the glycosidic bond (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch07_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_ziIwdrLfrs" id="dav_9781319322342_2jJA2onBvw">Fig. 7-11</a>). Sucrose is therefore a nonreducing sugar, and its stability — its resistance to oxidation — makes it a suitable molecule for the storage and transport of energy in plants. In the abbreviated nomenclature, a double-headed arrow connects the symbols specifying the anomeric carbons and their configurations.
