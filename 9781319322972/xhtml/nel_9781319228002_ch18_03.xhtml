This pathway was discovered in 1932 by Hans Krebs (who later also discovered the citric acid cycle) and a medical student associate, Kurt Henseleit. Urea production occurs almost exclusively in the liver and is the fate of most of the ammonia channeled there. The urea passes into the bloodstream and thus to the kidneys and is excreted into the urine. The production of urea now becomes the focus of our discussion.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_ysRpvvQ6Sp">A gray mitochondrion is shown across the top of the figure with a dark gray intermembrane space that has protrusions into the center. The light gray central region is labeled matrix and the region below is labeled cytosol. Above the upper left side of the mitochondrion, text reads, glutamine (from extrahepatic tissues). An arrow points down to glutamine in the mitochondrial matrix. An arrow labeled glutaminase points right from glutamine to glutamate, which is bolded. An arrow branches from this arrow to N H 4 plus in a light blue box below and to the right. Glutamate above the mitochondrion has an arrow pointing down to the bolded glutamate within the mitochondrion. An arrow labeled glutamate dehydrogenase points down from bolded glutamate to the same N H 4 plus in a light blue box. Another arrow points right from bolded glutamate and curves down to contact a curved arrow to the right from oxaloacetate to aspartate before ending at alpha-ketoglutarate. The point where these arrows meet is labeled aspartate aminotransferase. Oxaloacetate is shown in an orange box as a four-carbon chain. Numbered from right to left, C 1 forms C O O minus, C 2 is double bonded to O, C 3 is bonded to 2 H, and C 4 forms C O O minus. Aspartate is similar to oxaloacetate except that C 2 is bonded to N H 3 plus in a green box instead of double bonded to O. An arrow points down out of the mitochondria to show that this aspartate participates in step 2 b of the urea cycle. An arrow curves away from the arrow pointing from bolded glutamate to N H 4 plus in a light blue box and this arrow points to the same alpha-ketoglutarate produced by aspartate aminotransferase when the curved arrows from glutamate and oxaloacetate meet. The blue highlighted N H 4 plus has an arrow pointing down labeled carbamoyl phosphate synthetase Roma numeral 1. H C O 3 minus with C highlighted in yellow is added to this arrow. 2 orange circles labeled A T P are added and 2 A D P plus P subscript i leave. This reaction yields carbamoyl phosphate, shown as blue highlighted N H 2 bonded to yellow highlighted C double bonded to O above and bonded to O to the right further bonded to P double bonded to O above and bonded to O minus to the right and below. A blue arrow curves down from carbamoyl phosphate to meet the top curved arrow of the urea cycle at a point labeled 1 above ornithine transcarbamoylase. The blue arrow from carbamoyl phosphate meets the arrow below and curves away to show the release of P subscript i. The arrow below, forming the top of the urea cycle, curves from ornithine at the eleven o’clock position to citrulline at the one o’clock position. From left to right, ornithine is N H 3 plus bonded to a chain of 3 C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to N H 3 plus above and to C O O minus to the right. Citrulline is similar except that N H 3 plus is now N H and bonded to yellow highlighted C to its left further double bonded to O above and bonded to blue highlighted N H 2 to its left. A short blue arrow shows that citrulline moves from the mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol. A blue arrow labeled 2 a and argininosuccinate synthetase at the two o’clock position meets a curved blue arrow showing the addition of A T P and loss of P P subscript i. This yields a citrullyl-A M P intermediate, which is shown in brackets as a similar molecule to citrulline except that yellow highlighted C now has a yellow bond to N H to its right, is double bonded to N H in a light blue box to its left, and is bonded to O below further bonded to P bonded to O minus to the right, double bonded to O to the left, and bonded to O below further bonded to C 5 prime bonded to 2 H and bonded to C 4 prime of a five-membered ring with O at the top vertex. The ring has C 1 bonded to N in position 9 of a double-ring structure above and to H below, C 2 prime and C 3 prime bonded to H above and O H below, C 4 prime bonded to C 5 prime above and H below, and C 5 prime bonded to 2 H and further bonded to O of phosphate above. The double-ring structure has a five-membered ring on the left that shares its right side with a six-membered ring to the right. The five-membered ring has a double bond at its upper left side, between positions 7 and 8, a double bond at the right side that it shares with the six-membered ring between positions 4 and 5, N substituted for C at the upper left vertex at position 7, and N substituted for C at the bottom vertex, at position 9, and further bonded to C 1 prime of the ring below. The six-membered ring has double bonds at the upper right side between positions 1 and 6 and at the lower right side between positions 2 and 3. It has N substituted for C at positions 1 and 3 and a top vertex at position 6 bonded to N H 2. A blue arrow points down from the citrullyl-A M P intermediate at the three o’clock position to arginosuccinate just before the six-o’clock position. A blue curved arrow shows that aspartate produced by the reactions in the mitochondrial matrix above is added and A M P is produced. The point where the arrows meet is labeled 2 b and argininosuccinate synthetase. Aspartate is shown in an orange box as a four-carbon chain. Numbered from right to left, C 1 forms C O O minus, C 2 is bonded to N H 3 plus in a green box, C 3 is bonded to 2 H, and C 4 forms C O O minus. Argininosuccinate is shown with an orange box containing atoms from aspartate on the left. This is a horizontal chain of C 4 forming C O O minus bonded to C 3 bonded to 2 H and further bonded to C 3, which is bonded to H, bonded to C O O minus above that is still within the orange box, and bonded to N H in a green box to the right. N H in the green box is further bonded to atoms from the citrullyl-A M P intermediate. This N H is bonded to C in a yellow box double bonded to N H 2 plus in a light blue box above and to N H to the right further bonded to 3 C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to N H 3 plus above and C O O minus to the right. A blue arrow labeled argininosuccinase curves from this molecule to arginine at the seven o’clock position. A blue arrow labeled 3 curves away to show the loss of fumarase, shown in an orange box as a four-carbon chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 bonded to H and double bonded to C 3, C 3 bonded to H, and C 4 forming C O O minus. Arginine resembles argininosuccinate except that the atoms in the orange highlighted box are gone and N H in the green box is now N H 2 in a green box. A blue arrow curves up from arginine to ornithine at the nine o’clock position. A blue arrow curves to meet this arrow at a point labeled 4 and arginase, where H 2 O is added and urea is lost. Urea is shown in a purple box as N H 2 in a green box bonded to C in a yellow box double bonded to O above and bonded to N H 2 in a light blue box. Ornithine is N H 3 plus bonded to a chain of 3 C H 2 bonded to C H bonded to N H 3 plus above and to C O O minus to the right. An arrow points from ornithine in the cytosol to ornithine in the mitochondrial matrix, ready to continue the cycle with step 1. All data are approximate.</p>

A T P is shown in an orange box as P double bonded to O to the right, bonded to O minus below and to the left, and bonded to O above further bonded to a rectangle labeled A D P. Bicarbonate is shown as C double bonded to O above, and bonded to O H to the right, and bonded to O minus to the left. Red arrows point from the negative charge on O of bicarbonate to P in A T P and from the bond between P of A T P and the O above it, further bonded to A D P, to the same O. Step 1: Bicarbonate is phosphorylated by A T P. An arrow points right with an arrow branching to show the loss of A D P. This yields carbonic-phosphoric acid anhydride. This has C double bonded to O above, bonded to O H to the right, and bonded to O to the left further bonded to P double bonded to O above and bonded to O minus to the left and below. Red arrows point from a red pair of electrons on N of N H 3 below to C and from the bond between the same C and O to its left to the same O. N H 3 is shown in a light blue box. Step 2: Ammonia displaces phosphoryl group to generate carbamate. An arrow points right with an arrow curving away to show the loss of P subscript i. This yields carbamate, shown as C double bonded to O above, bonded to O minus to the right, and bonded to N H 2 in a light blue box to the left. Step 3: Carbamate is phosphorylated to yield carbamoyl phosphate. An arrow points right and is met by a curved arrow showing the addition of an orange oval labeled A T P and the loss of A D P. This yields carbamoyl phosphate, shown as blue highlighted N H 2 bonded to C double bonded to O above and bonded to O to the right further bonded to P double bonded to O above and bonded to O minus to the right and below. Part b begins with the addition of A T P and citrulline. A T P is shown as a vertical molecule with a rectangle labeled adenosine at the top bonded to a chain of three phosphates below. The rectangle labeled adenosine is bonded to O bonded to P double bonded to O to the right, bonded to O minus to the left, and bonded to O below further bonded to P double bonded to O to the right, bonded to O minus to the left, and bonded to O below further bonded to P double bonded to O to the right and bonded to O minus below and to the left.

Red arrows point from the red pair of electrons on N to the bond between N and C at the top of citrulline, from the double bond between the same C and O to its left and the top P in adenine, and from the bond between the same P in adenine and the bond connecting it to O below to the same O. Step 1: Rearrangement leads to addition of A M P, activating the carbonyl oxygen of citrulline. An arrow points right with an arrow branching off to show the loss of P P subscript i. This yields citrullyl-A M P, shown next to aspartate. Citrullyl-A M P is a vertical molecule with a similar structure to citrulline except that the top N H 2 has a positive charge on N and is double bonded to the C below, which is bonded to O to the left further bonded to a rectangle labeled A M P. Aspartate is shown as a four-carbon chain with C 1 forming C O O minus, C 2 bonded to H on the right and to N H 2 with a red pair of electrons on N in a light blue box to the left, C 3 bonded to 2 H, and C 4 forming C O O minus. Red arrows point from the pair of electrons on N in the light blue box to the top C of citrullyl-A M P and from the bond between the same C and O to its left further bonded to the rectangle labeled A M P to the same O. Step 2: Aspartate addition is facilitated by displacement of A M P. An arrow points right with an arrow branching off to show the loss of A M P. This yields argininosuccinate, which is similar to citrullyl-A M P except that the top C of the molecule, formerly bonded to O bonded to A M P, is now bonded to N H in a light blue box further bonded to C bonded to C O O minus above, H to the right, and C H 2 below further bonded to C O O minus.</p>

The interconnected cycles have been called the “Krebs bicycle.” The pathways linking the citric acid and urea cycles are known as the aspartate-argininosuccinate shunt; these effectively link the fates of the amino groups and the carbon skeletons of amino acids. The interconnections are quite elaborate. For example, some citric acid cycle enzymes, such as fumarase and malate dehydrogenase, have both cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes. Fumarate produced in the cytosol — whether by the urea cycle, purine biosynthesis, or other processes — can be converted to cytosolic malate, which is used in the cytosol or transported into mitochondria to enter the citric acid cycle. These processes are further intertwined with the malate-aspartate shuttle, a set of reactions that brings reducing equivalents into the mitochondrion. These different cycles and processes rely on a limited number of transporters in the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p>

Reducing equivalents are instead brought into the mitochondrion by converting aspartate to oxaloacetate in the cytosol, reducing the oxaloacetate to malate with NADH, and transporting the malate into the mitochondrial matrix via the malate–<i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_p2L9amzK7F">α</i>-ketoglutarate transporter.

However, they soon develop symptoms of hyperammonemia, including cerebral edema, lethargy, and hyperventilation. Without treatment, early death usually results. Symptoms may be less severe in patients retaining partial enzyme activity. These patients cannot tolerate protein-rich diets. Amino acids ingested in excess of the minimum daily requirements for protein synthesis are deaminated in the liver, producing free ammonia that cannot be converted to urea and exported into the bloodstream, and, as we have seen, ammonia is highly toxic. Given that most urea cycle steps are irreversible, the absent enzyme activity can often be identified by determining which cycle intermediate is present in elevated concentration in the blood and/or urine. Although the breakdown of amino acids can have serious health consequences in individuals with urea cycle deficiencies, a protein-free diet is not a treatment option.

Careful administration of the aromatic acids benzoate or phenylbutyrate in the diet can help lower the level of ammonia in the blood. Benzoate is converted to benzoyl-CoA, which combines with glycine to form hippurate (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch18_03.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_2Ivk4U6SsR" id="dav_9781319322342_5LVXXiMAHN"><strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_FlxU6hT2eb">Fig. 18-14</strong></a>, left). The glycine used up in this reaction must be regenerated, and ammonia is thus taken up in the glycine synthase reaction.
