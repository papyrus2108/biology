Glucose 6-phosphate does have other catabolic fates, however, which lead to specialized products needed by the cell.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_Tw5UCXgTn8">Fava beans, an ingredient of falafel, have been an important food source in the Mediterranean and the Middle East since antiquity. The Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras prohibited his followers from dining on fava beans, perhaps because they make many people sick with a condition called favism, which can be fatal. In favism, erythrocytes begin to lyse 24 to 48 hours after ingestion of the beans, releasing free hemoglobin into the blood. Jaundice and sometimes kidney failure can result. Similar symptoms can occur with ingestion of the antimalarial drug primaquine or of sulfa antibiotics, or following exposure to certain herbicides. These symptoms have a genetic basis: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which affects about 400 million people worldwide. Most G6PD-deficient individuals are asymptomatic; only the combination of G6PD deficiency and certain environmental factors produces the clinical manifestations.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_HBanJjLttu">The geographic distribution of G6PD deficiency is instructive. Frequencies as high as 25% occur in tropical Africa, parts of the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, areas where malaria is most prevalent. In addition to such epidemiological observations, in vitro studies show that growth of one malaria parasite, <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_X0HIVjECZa">Plasmodium falciparum</i>, is inhibited in G6PD-deficient erythrocytes. The parasite is very sensitive to oxidative damage and is killed by a level of oxidative stress that is tolerable to a G6PD-deficient human host. Because the advantage of resistance to malaria balances the disadvantage of lowered resistance to oxidative damage, natural selection sustains the G6PD-deficient genotype in human populations where malaria is prevalent. Only under overwhelming oxidative stress, caused by drugs, herbicides, or divicine, does G6PD deficiency cause serious medical problems.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_pN7vvljQxH">An antimalarial drug such as primaquine is believed to act by causing oxidative stress to the parasite. It is ironic that antimalarial drugs can cause human illness through the same biochemical mechanism that provides resistance to malaria. Divicine also acts as an antimalarial drug, and ingestion of fava beans may protect against malaria. By refusing to eat falafel, many Pythagoreans with normal G6PD activity may have unwittingly increased their risk of malaria!</p>

The condition known as beriberi is characterized by an accumulation of body fluids (swelling), pain, paralysis, and ultimately, without treatment, death. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, also caused by a severe deficiency of thiamine, typically includes problems with voluntary movements, reflected in abnormal eye movements and gait, and neurological defects. The syndrome is more common among heavy drinkers than in the general population because chronic, heavy alcohol consumption interferes with the intestinal absorption of thiamine. The syndrome can be exacerbated by a mutation in the gene for transketolase that results in an enzyme with a lowered affinity for TPP â€” an affinity one-tenth that of the normal enzyme. This defect makes individuals much more sensitive to a thiamine deficiency: even a moderate thiamine deficiency (tolerable in individuals with an unmutated transketolase) can result in a transketolase that is not saturated with TPP at its normal concentration. The result is a slowing down of the whole pentose phosphate pathway. In people with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, this mutation results in a worsening of symptoms, which can include severe memory loss, mental confusion, and partial paralysis. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large inline" id="dav_9781319322342_vptXrrV1Xt" role="presentation" src="../images/nelsonlehnpob8e_14_pg523.png"/></p>
