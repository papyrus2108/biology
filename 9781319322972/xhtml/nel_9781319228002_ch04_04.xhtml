Amino acids that are far apart in the polypeptide sequence and are in different types of secondary structure may interact within the completely folded structure of a protein. Interacting segments of polypeptide chains are held in their characteristic tertiary positions by several kinds of weak interactions (and sometimes by covalent bonds such as disulfide cross-links) between the segments. Some proteins contain two or more separate polypeptide chains, or subunits, which may be identical or different.

These three groups are structurally distinct. Fibrous proteins usually consist of a single type of secondary structure, and their tertiary structure is relatively simple. Globular proteins often contain several types of secondary structure. Intrinsically disordered proteins can lack secondary structure entirely. The groups also differ functionally: the structures that provide support, shape, and external protection to vertebrates are made of fibrous proteins. Most enzymes are globular proteins, whereas regulatory proteins can be globular, disordered, or contain both globular and disordered segments.</p>

In each case, the fundamental structural unit is a simple repeating element of secondary structure. All fibrous proteins are insoluble in water, a property conferred by a high concentration of hydrophobic amino acid residues both in the interior of the protein and on its surface. These hydrophobic surfaces are largely buried, as many similar polypeptide chains are packed together to form elaborate supramolecular complexes. The underlying structural simplicity of fibrous proteins makes them particularly useful for illustrating some of the fundamental principles of protein structure discussed previously.</p>

There is a small space, then a much longer similar piece that has two intertwined strands that each end in an oblong structure on the left end. The bottom horizontal line is similar but inverted, with the longer strand on the left and the oblong structures at its right. The width of the two horizontal lines together is 20 to 30 angstroms. A profibril is shown as four horizontal lines. The top line has three pieces each made up of two intertwined strands with each strand ending in two oblongs on the right. The second line has three pieces of the same length and structure, except that the oblongs are on the left. The pieces in the top two lines are lined up so that there are three sets of two strands, one above the other in opposite orientations. The third and fourth lines are similar but shifted so that there are two complete sets of strands with partial strands to their left and right sides. Part b shows a thick cylinder made up of many bundles inside. Lines are visible running along the length of its outer surface and a single thin line is wrapped along its width near the place that it is cut to show the interior. There are many tightly packed bundles inside that all contain many small circles labeled, cells. A close-up of an intermediate filament extending from the cross-sectional end shows that it contains multiple smaller bundles, each containing two circles. A close-up of one of these bundles, labeled protofibril, shows that the smaller circles inside are cut protofilaments. An extended piece of protofilament shows that it contains many linear structures and a close-up of one of these shows that it is two intertwined strands labeled, two-chain coiled coil.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_RmFJC2yPxw">There are many types of vertebrate collagen. Typically, they contain about 35% Gly, 11% Ala, and 21% Pro and 4-Hyp (4-hydroxyproline, an uncommon amino acid; see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch03_02.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_7oeAaW1E9A" id="dav_9781319322342_ecKJsiEFbo">Fig. 3-8a</a>). The food product gelatin is derived from collagen. It has little nutritional value as a <span aria-label="119" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page119" role="doc-pagebreak"/>protein, because collagen is extremely low in many amino acids that are essential in the human diet. The unusual amino acid content of collagen is related to structural constraints unique to the collagen helix. The amino acid sequence in collagen is generally a repeating tripeptide unit, Gly–X–Y, where X is often Pro and Y is often 4-Hyp. Only Gly residues can be accommodated at the very tight junctions between the individual <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_oK8OJwBMbC">α</i> chains (<a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_GW50pUzcoH" id="dav_9781319322342_UXdUQtAps7">Fig. 4-11b</a>).

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_VzNmjzudyV">This excerpt describes the plight of Louis IX’s scurvy-weakened army before it was destroyed by the Egyptians toward the end of the Seventh Crusade (1248–1254). What was the nature of the malady afflicting these thirteenth-century soldiers?</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_Dwqg7GK3RG">Scurvy is caused by lack of vitamin C, or ascorbic acid (ascorbate). Vitamin C is required for, among other things, the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen; scurvy is a deficiency disease characterized by general degeneration of connective tissue. Manifestations of advanced scurvy include numerous small hemorrhages caused by fragile blood vessels; tooth loss, poor wound healing, and the reopening of old wounds; bone pain and degeneration; and eventually heart failure. Milder cases of vitamin C deficiency are accompanied by fatigue, irritability, and an increased severity of respiratory tract infections. Most animals make large amounts of vitamin C, converting glucose to ascorbate in four enzymatic steps. But in the course of evolution, humans and some other animals—gorillas, guinea pigs, and fruit bats—have lost the last enzyme in this pathway and must obtain ascorbate in their diet. Vitamin C is available in a wide range of fruits and vegetables. Until 1800, however, it was often absent in the dried foods and other food supplies stored for winter or for extended travel.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_OL5m0E3dR5">Scurvy came to wide public notice during the European voyages of discovery from 1500 to 1800. In fact, during the first circumnavigation of the globe (1519–1522) by Ferdinand Magellan, more than 80% of his crew were lost to scurvy. Winter outbreaks of scurvy in Europe were gradually eliminated in the nineteenth century as the cultivation of the potato, introduced from South America, became widespread.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_nwC4TwXvME">In 1747, James Lind, a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, carried out the first controlled clinical study in recorded history. During an extended voyage on the 50-gun warship HMS <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_Ymgmm3qYUU">Salisbury</i>, Lind selected 12 sailors suffering from scurvy and separated them into groups of two. All 12 received the same diet, except that each group was given a different remedy for scurvy from among those recommended at the time. The sailors given lemons and oranges recovered and returned to duty. Lind’s <i class="semantic-i" id="dav_9781319322342_cQLRNK30We">Treatise on the Scurvy</i> was published in 1753, but inaction persisted in the Royal Navy for another 40 years. In 1795, the British admiralty finally mandated a ration of concentrated lime or lemon juice for all British sailors (hence the name “limeys”). Scurvy continued to be a problem in some other parts of the world until 1932, when Hungarian scientist Albert Szent-Györgyi, and W. A. Waugh and C. G. King at the University of Pittsburgh, isolated and synthesized ascorbic acid.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_6QV27GtVXa">So why is ascorbate so necessary to good health? Of particular interest to us here is its role in the formation of collagen.

A 2009 study of more than 1,100 men and women between the ages of 20 and 29 in Toronto, Canada, found that 1 in 7 young adults had vitamin C deficiency due to unmet dietary needs. Moreover, lower vitamin C levels were associated with higher measures of obesity and blood pressure and fewer servings a day of healthy foods.

Some human genetic defects in collagen structure illustrate the close relationship between amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure in this protein. Osteogenesis imperfecta is characterized by abnormal bone formation in babies; at least eight variants of this condition, with different degrees of severity, occur in the human population. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by loose joints, and at least six variants occur in humans. The composer Niccolò Paganini (1782–1840) was famed for his seemingly impossible dexterity in playing the violin. He suffered from a variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that rendered him effectively double-jointed. In both disorders, some variants can be lethal, whereas others cause lifelong problems.</p>

The data files in the PDB describe the spatial coordinates of each atom for which the position has been determined (many of the cataloged structures are not complete). Additional data files provide information on how the structure was determined and its accuracy. The atomic coordinates can be converted into an image of the macromolecule by using structure visualization software.

It functions both to store oxygen and to facilitate oxygen diffusion in rapidly contracting muscle tissue. Myoglobin contains a single polypeptide chain of 153 amino acid residues of known sequence and a single iron protoporphyrin, or heme, group. The same heme group that is found in myoglobin is found in hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of erythrocytes, and is responsible for the deep red-brown color of both myoglobin and hemoglobin. Myoglobin is particularly abundant in the muscles of diving mammals such as whales, seals, and porpoises — so abundant that the muscles of these animals are brown. Storage and distribution of oxygen by muscle myoglobin permits diving mammals to remain submerged for long periods.

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_7UxaoVppZ3">Many important conclusions were drawn from the structure of myoglobin. The positioning of amino acid side chains reflects a structure that is largely stabilized by the hydrophobic effect. Most of the hydrophobic R groups are in the interior of the molecule, hidden from exposure to water. All but two of the polar R groups are located on the outer surface of the molecule, and all are hydrated. The myoglobin molecule is so compact that its interior has room for only four molecules of water. This dense hydrophobic core is typical of globular proteins. The fraction of space occupied by atoms in an organic liquid is 0.4 to 0.6. In a globular protein the fraction is about 0.75, comparable to that in a crystal (in a typical crystal the fraction is 0.70 to 0.78, near the theoretical maximum). In this packed environment, weak interactions strengthen and reinforce each other. For example, the nonpolar side chains in the core are so close together that short-range van der Waals interactions make a significant contribution to stabilizing interactions.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_0OQNyeFjA5">Although many proteins contain well-folded and stable structures, this is not necessary for the biological function of all proteins. Many proteins or protein segments lack ordered structures in solution. The concept that some proteins function in the absence of a definable three-dimensional structure comes from reassessment of data from many different proteins. As many as a third of all human proteins may be unstructured or may have significant unstructured segments. All organisms have some proteins that fall into this category. Intrinsically disordered proteins have properties that are distinct from those of classical, structured proteins. They often lack a hydrophobic core and instead are characterized by high densities of charged amino acid residues such as Lys, Arg, and Glu. Pro residues are also prominent, as they tend to disrupt ordered structures.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_cH8DwhO6qm">Structural disorder and high charge density can facilitate the function of some proteins as spacers, insulators, or linkers in larger structures. Other disordered proteins are scavengers, binding up ions and small molecules in solution and serving as reservoirs or garbage dumps. However, many intrinsically disordered proteins are at the heart of important protein interaction networks. The lack of an ordered structure can facilitate a kind of functional promiscuity, allowing one protein to interact with multiple or even dozens of partners. Structural disorder allows some inhibitor proteins, such as the mammalian cell division protein p27, to interact with multiple targets in different ways. In solution, p27 lacks definable structure. However, it wraps around and inhibits the action of several enzymes called protein kinases (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch06_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_dXDo5v3PcQ" id="dav_9781319322342_2noQDXrJ1O">Chapter 6</a>) that facilitate cell division. The flexible structure of p27 allows it to accommodate itself to its different target proteins. Human tumor cells, which are cells that have lost the capacity to control cell division normally, generally have reduced levels of p27; the lower the levels of p27, the poorer the prognosis for the cancer patient.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_mfMTq4rnXA">Similarly, intrinsically disordered proteins are often present as hubs or scaffolds at the center of protein networks that constitute signaling pathways (see <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch12_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_4butAVFqX4" id="dav_9781319322342_0sko3Y7OBS">Fig. 12-30</a>). These proteins, or parts of them, may interact with many different binding partners. They often take on an ordered structure when they interact with other proteins, but the structure they assume may vary with different binding partners. The mammalian protein p53 is also critical in the control of cell division. It contains both structured and unstructured segments, and the different segments interact with dozens of other proteins. An unstructured region of p53 at the carboxyl terminus interacts with at least four different binding partners and assumes a different structure in each of the complexes (<strong class="important" id="dav_9781319322342_k6zbFcZzJb"><a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_04.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_q1JqWaDznf" id="dav_9781319322342_nvRliwvON2">Fig. 4-20</a></strong>).</p>

Only the central domain is well ordered. (b) The linear sequence of the p53 protein is depicted as a colored bar. The overlaid graph presents a plot of the PONDR (Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions) score versus the protein sequence. PONDR is one of the best available algorithms for predicting the likelihood that a given amino acid residue is in a region of intrinsic disorder, based on the surrounding amino acid sequence and amino acid composition. A score of 1.0 indicates a probability of 100% that a protein will be disordered. In the actual protein structure, the tan central domain is ordered. The amino-terminal (blue) and carboxyl-terminal (red) regions are disordered. (c) The very end of the carboxyl-terminal region has multiple binding partners and folds when it binds to each of them; however, the three-dimensional structure that is assumed when binding occurs is different for each of the interactions shown, and thus this carboxyl-terminal segment (11 to 20 residues) is shown in a different color in each complex. <span class="attribution" id="dav_9781319322342_s6UieefKyC">[Information from V.

There is a horizontal strip running from 0.5 on the vertical axis that is divided into three segments before it ends with a vertical strip at 380 on the horizontal axis. Segment 1 runs from 0 to 90 on the horizontal axis, segment 2 runs from 90 to 280 on the horizontal axis, and segment 3 runs from 280 to 380 on the horizontal axis. A line runs from the N terminus of the protein in part a to segment 1, a line runs from the double helix in the protein to segment 2, and a line runs from the C terminus to segment 3. The vertical strip has four segments. The first is wider than the others and runs from 0.25 to 0.4 on the vertical axis, the second runs from 0.4 to 0.5 on the vertical axis, the third runs from 0.5 to 0.6 on the vertical axis, and the fourth runs from 0.6 to 0.7 on the vertical axis.

<p class="noindent" id="dav_9781319322342_FJ6WdAP5or">Part a is labeled, structurally similar, different sequence and organism. Two proteins are shown. The left-hand protein is labeled, 2 J H F, alcohol dehydrogenase, italicized Equus italicized caballus, horse. The protein is roughly a vertical oval with the N terminus near the upper left side and the C terminus at the top. It has multiple ribbon arrows at the top, and near the N terminus as well as in a line near the bottom. It also has helices, mostly in the center with two extending below the row of arrows. The right-hand protein is labeled, 1 F 8 F, alcohol dehydrogenase, italicized Acinetobacter, italicized calcoaceticus, bacterium found in human intestinal microbiota. The structure is very similar to the left-hand structure. Part b shows a topology diagram that consists of interconnected cylinders and arrows. There are two antiparallel arrows on the upper left in a rectangle. The N terminus connects to the right-hand arrow, labeled 1, that points down. It connects by a strand to arrow 2, which points up. The string bends right across the top of both arrows and leaves the box, then enters a larger box to the right containing seven arrows, with 11 above 34 on the left both pointing up, then down arrow 3, up arrow 5, down arrow 6, up arrow 13, and up arrow 31. The string crosses above arrows 11 above 34, and enters downward arrow 3. The string then continues out of the box into cylinder 4 before looping back up to upward arrow 5, adjacent to arrow 3. The string leaves arrow 5 and curves down to adjacent down arrow 6, then continues out of the box and enters and leaves cylinders 7, 8, 9, and 10 in a vertical line going downward before looping up along the side of another rectangle to the lower left and back up to arrow 11, which is to the left of arrow 3. It leaves arrow 11 and enters a tiny cylinder labeled, 12 above the box, then crosses above arrows 3, 5, and 6, to loop back down into the box and enter the bottom of arrow 13, then up out of the box to go through small cylinders 14 and 15 and larger cylinder 16 along a vertical line before looping back down along the right side of the diagram and bending back to the left to travel through arrow 17, which points to the left. Arrow 17 is in a box with all of the arrows pointing left. From top to bottom, they are 21, 19, 17, 35, 25, and 27. The arrow continues through cylinder 18 outside of the box, loops back to the base of arrow 19 and then out to cylinder 20, loops back to the base of cylinder 21, then out through cylinder 22, then back down and through the center of the box to enter the back of arrow 23, then out through cylinder 24, then down across the bottom of the box to loop around into arrow 25, then out through cylinder 26, then back into the box to loop into the base of arrow 27, then out through small cylinder 28, then cylinder 29 (colored the same as the arrows unlike the other cylinders), then through small cylinder 30 before looping back to the left and running up to arrow 31 in the rectangle above, then out through small cylinder 32, larger cylinder 33, and looping back to the left above the box and then down to the base of arrow 34 on the left side of the box and then up out of the box to end at the C terminus. Part c shows two molecules. The left-hand molecule is labeled All alpha, 1 B C F, ferritin-like, bacterioferritin (cytochrome italicized b subscript 1), italicized Escherichia, italicized coli. It consists of four roughly vertical helices connected by strands, with one strand extending out of the top and one strand ending with a small horizontal helix that runs across the bottom and extends a short strand to the left. The right-hand molecule is labeled all beta, 1 P E X, four-bladed beta propeller, collagenase-3 (M M P-13), human (italicized Homo, italicized sapiens). The molecule has a roughly circular structure that begins with a small string at the lower left that joins to a short helix that runs to the tip of a right-pointing arrow before looping through three more arrows to a very short curl of a helix on the lower left, then up to seven short arrows, then over to a coil of a helix at the upper right and through an almost horizontal row of four arrows before ending on the right side.</p>

<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_TeW0mw12ex">The number of folding patterns is not infinite. Among the tens of thousands of distinct protein structures archived in the PDB, only about 1,400 different folds or motifs are classified by the SCOP2 database. Given the many years of progress in structural biology, new motifs are now discovered only rarely. Many examples of recurring domain or motif structures are available, and these reveal that protein tertiary structure is more reliably conserved than amino acid sequence. The comparison of protein structures can thus provide much information about evolution. Proteins with significant similarity in primary structure and/or with similar tertiary structure and function are said to be in the same <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_joXC50kJds">protein family</dfn>. The protein structures in the PDB belong to about 4,000 different protein families. A strong evolutionary relationship <span aria-label="126" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page126" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is usually evident within a protein family. For example, the globin family has many different proteins with both structural and sequence similarities to myoglobin (as seen in the proteins used as examples in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_qjoNXstTVX" id="dav_9781319322342_gmtpP6SqmF">Figures 4-30</a> and <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch04_06.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_Stx3BpDtLo" id="dav_9781319322342_qwm0wuGTeI">4-31</a> and in <a class="crossref" href="nel_9781319228002_ch05_01.xhtml#dav_9781319322342_idIyOmduYS" id="dav_9781319322342_O2xsNQl4qM">Chapter 5</a>). Two or more families that have little similarity in amino acid sequence but make use of the same major structural motif and have functional similarities are grouped into <dfn class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" id="dav_9781319322342_PFsvL6l7KQ">superfamilies</dfn>. An evolutionary relationship among families in a superfamily is considered probable, even though time and functional distinctions — that is, different adaptive pressures — may have erased many of the telltale sequence relationships.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_daf9GmCxGb">A protein family may be widespread in all three domains of cellular life — the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya — suggesting an ancient origin. Many proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and the metabolism of nucleic acids and proteins fall into this category. Other families may be present in only a small group of organisms, indicating that the structure arose more recently. Tracing the natural history of structural motifs through the use of structural classifications in databases such as SCOP2 provides a powerful complement to sequence analyses in tracing evolutionary relationships. The SCOP2 database is curated manually, with the objective of placing proteins in the correct evolutionary framework based on conserved structural features.</p>
<p class="indent" id="dav_9781319322342_U054eOoBcy">Structural motifs become especially important in defining protein families and superfamilies. Improved protein classification and comparison systems lead inevitably to the elucidation of new functional relationships. Given the central role of proteins in living systems, these structural comparisons can help illuminate every aspect of biochemistry, from the evolution of individual proteins to the evolutionary history of complete metabolic pathways.</p>

In other cases, separate subunits take on separate but related functions, such as catalysis and regulation. Some associations, such as those seen in the fibrous proteins considered earlier in this chapter and the coat proteins of viruses, serve primarily structural roles. Some very large protein assemblies are the site of complex, multistep reactions. For example, each ribosome, the site of protein synthesis, incorporates dozens of protein subunits along with RNA molecules.</p>
